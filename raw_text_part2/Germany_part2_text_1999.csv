page 6",ANNEX,"Recommendations of the Bureau of the fifty-fourth session
of the Commission on Human Rights pursuant to Commission
decision 1998/112","RECOMMENDATION 1. There is scope for rationalizing and strengthening
the current network of mandates in order to ensure that all aspects of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights warranting attention are adequately
addressed. The Bureau consequently recommends that the Commission consider
the following proposals:","(a) Merge the mandates of the independent expert on structural
adjustment and the Special Rapporteur on foreign debt;","(b) Convert the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on toxic wastes into
that of Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment;","(c) Transform the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention into a Special
Rapporteur on arbitrary detention;","(d) Transform the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary
Disappearances into a Special Rapporteur on disappearances;","(e) Terminate the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the use of
mercenaries and recommend that this matter be henceforth considered directly
in the General Assembly (Sixth Committee);","(f) Terminate the mandate of the Sub-Commission's Working Group on
Contemporary Forms of Slavery and transfer those responsibilities which are
not addressed by existing mechanisms to a new Special Rapporteur on
contemporary forms of slavery.",(It should be emphasized that these recommendations go hand in hand with,"the proposal, reflected in paragraph 45 below, that steps be taken to","ensure that all thematic mechanisms receive adequate professional
support from OHCHR.)
RECOMMENDATION 2. In instances where difficulty is being experienced in
securing governmental responses to urgent appeals, the Chair of the Commission
should play a role in assisting to obtain an appropriate response at the
request of the special procedure concerned.
RECOMMENDATION 3. Recognizing that the special procedures are subsidiary
creations of the Commission, expected to report to and be otherwise
exclusively accountable to it, the Bureau recommends that, as a general rule,
appointments to special procedures posts be made by the Chair of the
Commission, following consultations with the Commission's Bureau.",(f),"E/CN.4/1999/L.101
page 7","RECOMMENDATION 4. To ensure prompt implementation of special procedures
mandates, the Bureau recommends that the Commission consider the following
options for a recommendation to ECOSOC:","- Option 1. That ECOSOC adopt a general decision authorizing an
immediate provisional start to the implementation of all new
mandates proposed by the Commission, subject to confirmation
during the Council's annual substantive session.","- Option 2. That ECOSOC consider the holding of a brief session
each spring, immediately following the Commission's session, to
consider all Commission proposals regarding special procedures
mandates.","- Option 3. That ECOSOC's regular May organizational session
include on its agenda the consideration of the Commission's
proposals regarding special procedures mandates.","RECOMMENDATION 5. The Commission's established practice of setting and
renewing mandates for thematic mechanisms on the basis of a standard
three-year term has proven valuable in ensuring continuity and permitting
effective work-planning.","RECOMMENDATION 6. The Bureau recommends that any individual's tenure in a
given mandate, whether thematic or country-specific, be no more than six
years. As a transitional measure, officeholders who may have served more than
three years when their current mandates expire should be limited to at most
three years of further renewals in those posts. All individuals would be
eligible for reassignment to other mandates.","RECOMMENDATION 7. At each session of the Commission, there should be
conducted regular, focused and systematic deliberations on serious incidents
or situations involving a failure or denial of cooperation by Governments with
the Commission or its mechanisms. These deliberations should be an integral
part of the procedure, proposed in recommendation 9 below, for Commission
deliberations on the reports of special procedures.",RECOMMENDATION 8:,"(a) Annual reports to the Commission should continue, wherever
possible, to be submitted by the middle of December;","(b) Advance, unedited copies of all reports in the original language
should be made available to delegations as soon as they are submitted to OHCHR
(in the same manner as such copies of ECOSOC reports are made available to
Council members) ;",,"
E/CN.4/1999/L.101
page 8","(c) All reports should include an executive summary, no longer than
four pages, reflecting all key elements which should form the basis for the
Commission's deliberations on the report in question. This document should be
structured to highlight the mechanism's principal observations, conclusions
and recommendations, and highlight any observations or recommendations on the
issue of follow-up on prior recommendations and on the question of cooperation
of Governments with the mechanism. OHCHR should develop standard formats for
such executive summaries for thematic and for country-specific mechanisms;","(d) The executive summaries of all reports should be given the highest
priority by the Languages Service and be issued in the framework of a
compilation of all such executive summaries. This compilation would include a
separate chapter highlighting any observations or recommendations concerning
serious incidents or situations involving a failure or denial of cooperation
with the Commission or its mechanisms;","(e) Mechanisms could continue to orally supplement or update their
annual reports to reflect any relevant developments in the period following
submission of the initial report. Where it is necessary to provide such
updates in writing, this would be done in a document of no more than two pages

development;","(£) Outside the framework of regular annual reports, special mission
reports or reports addressing critical or urgent developments in situations
should continue to be submitted for appropriate action and processing, and
brought to the Bureau's attention.",RECOMMENDATION 9:,"(a) In addition to formal presentations of special procedures reports
and responses of concerned States, the Commission's deliberations in respect
of each mechanism's report should include a more focused, systematic dialogue",(c),(a),on:,The observations and recommendations of each mechanism;,"The extent to which current and relevant past

recommendation 8), and any supplementary/updated information brought to the
Commission's attention by the mechanism or by the Government concerned, would
afford the principal basis for organizing discussion during these dialogues;","(c) In this process, the Government concerned should be encouraged,
and offered every reasonable opportunity, to explain its position on the
issues at hand;","(d) While recognizing that it may not be possible to have all
documentation available in the envisaged form for 1999, the Bureau
recommends that, in considering the reports of its special procedures at its
fifty-fifth session, the Commission take all practicable steps possible to
organize the type of dialogue envisaged above.",RECOMMENDATION 10:,"(a) The Bureau recommends that OHCHR, in collaboration with the
special procedures, prepare and compile in a single document, to be issued in
late September each year, a summary report on the progress realized and steps
taken to date in connection with the recommendations of the mechanisms and the
conclusions of the annual session of the Commission;","(b) This document would be reviewed in meetings of the Bureau, held
in advance of the human rights debate of the General Assembly. In these
meetings, the Bureau would consider any appropriate steps it might take, or
advice it might offer to concerned parties, to assist in advancing the process
of implementation or follow-through on the recommendations of the mechanisms
or conclusions of the Commission. These meetings could include private
dialogues with representatives of concerned States;","(c) At the conclusion of this annual Bureau review meeting, the Bureau
would conduct a public briefing for representatives of all Commission members
on any observations or conclusions it may consider appropriate to report.
RECOMMENDATION 11. The Bureau recommends that the Commission's confidential
1503 procedure be amended in the following ways:","(a) Deliberations to select situations which should be brought to the
attention of the Commission should be conducted by a single body, a Committee
on Situations, comprised of five independent experts appointed each year by
the Chair of the Commission (no individual to serve more than three years),
and meeting twice per year:","(1) First, at the beginning of September to examine monthly
summaries of communications prepared by the secretariat,","E/CN.4/1999/L.101
page 10","originals of communications and any government replies
received to date. At that time the Committee would decide
which communications it should refer to States for
clarification, requesting that any replies be submitted
on time for the next meeting; and","(1ii) Second, 1in January, to examine dossiers on the situations
concerned, including original communications, replies
received from Governments and any additional relevant
information from other United Nations sources, including
treaty monitoring bodies and special procedures. The
Committee would then determine whether or not to refer
the situations before it to the Commission for its
consideration, and prepare a summary report identifying the
main issues of concern and suggested ways of addressing
those concerns, but would not make recommendations in the","
form of ", resolutions or decisions;,Deliberations at the Commission level would also involve two,|(ii>,(b),phases:,"(1) A closed meeting at the earliest possible stage in the
session, to which the Governments concerned would be
invited, to undertake a meaningful dialogue with the
Commission; and","(1ii) A second closed meeting, towards the conclusion of the
session, and in the presence of the Governments concerned,
to decide on appropriate action, including a decision
whether to continue or discontinue consideration of the
matter within the confidential procedure, or whether to take
up the matter in the Commission's public proceedings - which
should be the principal option in cases in which government
cooperation has been inadequate;","(c) At the conclusion of a session, the Chair of the Commission should
announce publicly the names of the countries considered, the main issues of
concern and the course of action which the Commission has decided to take;","(d) OHCHR would continue to play a crucial role in providing the
necessary support for the procedure to ensure effective performance of all
the necessary tasks, inter alia:",(1),(ii),"E/CN.4/1999/L.101
page 11","- Ensuring appropriate acknowledgement, and referral to concerned
Governments, of communications received;",- Sifting out communications that appear to be manifestly unfounded;,"- Ensuring that Governments concerned are kept appropriately and
punctually advised of any decision taken in the Committee that
requires their attention;",- Preparing material/dossiers for deliberations by the Committee and,"the Commission.
RECOMMENDATION 12:","(a) Reflecting the role of the Sub-Commission in assisting the
Commission to address a broad range of human rights issues, it should be
renamed “the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights”;","(b) Reflecting the proposed sharpening of the Sub-Commission's role as
an independent expert body focusing its attention on priorities determined by
the Commission:",(1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to,,,"(1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to
15 members, nominated by the Chair of the Commission in
consultation with the Bureau, on the basis of their expert
qualifications, to serve a four-year term, renewable for a
maximum of one additional four-year term. To preserve the
image of the Sub-Commission as an independent expert body,
no member should be concurrently employed in the executive
branch of their country's Government;","(ii) The length of annual sessions of the Sub-Commission should
be reduced to two weeks;","(c) The Sub-Commission's work and priorities should be based on tasks
entrusted to it by the Commission on Human Rights, with the principal focus
on the elaboration of studies, research and expert advice at the request of
the Commission. The Commission should regard the Sub-Commission's experts
as its foremost resource for the performance of such assignments, rather
than appointing others to undertake expert research and analysis; and in
considering the assignment of projects to the Sub-Commission, the Commission
might consider relevant proposals from the High Commissioner for Human Rights,
from other United Nations human rights institutions and from the
Sub-Commission itself;","(d) The Sub-Commission's working methods in respect of its research
and study projects should, consistent with the independent expert character of",(ii),"E/CN.4/1999/L.101
page 12","the body, entail a well-prepared, thorough peer-review process culminating in
an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study
in question, any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of
major observations of members of the Sub-Commission. This approach would
preclude the need for negotiating traditional resolutions for submission to
the Commission. While the Sub-Commission's deliberations should provide
opportunities for interested Governments, international organizations and NGOs
to provide input into this process, the experts should also be prepared to
dedicate adequate time to private deliberations on their projects, inter alia
in the framework of sessional working groups such as the existing working
group on the administration of justice;","(e) Recognizing the important opportunities the Sub-Commission and
some of its subsidiary bodies play in affording a public forum for concerned
parties to raise their human rights concerns:","(1) The Sub-Commission should continue to conduct an annual
debate on human rights violations in all parts of the world.
However, rather than leading to the negotiation of
resolutions, this debate should be reflected in a summary
to the Commission as part of the Sub-Commission's annual",report;,"(i1) The Sub-Commission's inter-sessional Working Groups on
Minorities and on Indigenous Populations should continue to
perform the valuable work they are engaged in, the latter
until such time as the question of its future status is
resolved in the context of the Commission's deliberations
on a permanent forum for indigenous people in the
United Nations system. The question of the Working Group
on Contemporary Forms of Slavery is addressed in
recommendation 1 above;","(f) As regards transitional arrangements associated with these
proposed changes, the Bureau recommends that the Commission devise a
transitional process aimed at bringing the recommended reforms fully into
effect for the fifty-second session of the Sub-Commission in the year 2000.
RECOMMENDATION 13:","(a) Before referring any matter to a working group, the Commission on
Human Rights should, where the needed groundwork has not been otherwise laid,
request the Sub-Commission to undertake a study on the question at hand and",(ii),"E/CN.4/1999/L.101
page 13",,prepare a ," text of the instrument envisaged. Among the issues to be
addressed in any such study, and in the Commission's deliberations on whether
to proceed, careful consideration should be given to the purposes of any",,"
ing exercise and to the guidelines set out in General Assembly
resolution 41/120;","(b) In creating any standard-setting working group, the Commission
should consider and agree on a specific time-frame within which the group
would be called upon to complete its task. This could vary depending on the
complexity of the issue and the nature of the instrument (e.g. a procedural
protocol might reasonably be completed within two or three years), but in any
event the established time-frame should not exceed five years. If, by the end
of its mandate, the working group has not been able to achieve a result, the
Commission should set a period of reflection (such as one or two years) before
any extension is provided;","(c) Regarding the question of concluding a standard-setting exercise
with or without a vote, it should be borne in mind that there is no rule of
procedure requiring the Commission on Human Rights, ECOSOC or the General
Assembly to adopt standard-setting instruments by consensus, and there are
indeed examples where consensus has not been achieved. O0Of course, all efforts
should be made at reaching consensus;","(d) Finally, all working group chairs (whose terms should be linked
with that of the working group) should have standing authority to undertake,
between working group meetings, informal contacts and consultations with a
view to advancing progress in respect of the working group's mandate. Results
of such consultations should be communicated to concerned delegations on a
timely basis and at the start of each session.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UNFCCC REPORTING GUIDELINES ON ANNUAL INVENTORIES","
A. Objectives",The objectives of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories are:,1.,"(a) To assist Annex [ Parties in meeting their commitments under Articles 4 and 12 of
the Convention and in preparing to meet possible future commitments under Articles 3. 5 and 7
of the Kyoto Protocol:.","(b)  To facilitate the process of considering annual national inventories and national
inventories included in national communications. including the preparation of technical analysis
and synthesis documentation: and","(¢)  To facilitate the process of verification and technical assessment and expert review
of the inventory intormation. v","
B. Principles and definitions","2. National greenhouse gas inventories. reterred to below only as inventories. should be
transparent. consistent. comparable. complete and accurate.","3. [nventories should be prepared using comparable methodologies agreed upon by the
Conference of the Parties (COP). as indicated in paragraph 7 below. and any good practices'
agreed upon by the COP at a future session.",In the context of these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories:,4.,Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory,,.,"
' The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is currently developing guidance on good practices as
part of its work related to uncertainties in inventories. This guidance may be available for consideration by the
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) in 2000. Guidance on good practices may
include. inter aliu, advice on the choice of methodology. emission factors, activity data, and uncertainties, and on a
series of quality assessment and quality control procedures which may be applied during the preparation of
inventories.","
FCCC/SBSTA/1999/6/Add. 1

should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of
the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the
process for the communication and consideration of information:","Consistency means that an inventory should be internally consistent in all its elements
with inventories of other years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used
for the base and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or
removals from sources or sinks. Under certain circumstances referred to in paragraphs 10 and
11, an inventory using different methodologies for different years can be considered to be
consistent if it has been recalculated in a transparent manner. taking into account any good
practices; '","
Comparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by Parties in
inventories should be comparable among Parties. For this purpose, Parties should use the
methodologies and formats agreed by the COP for estimating and reporting inventories. The
allocation of different source/sink categories should follow the split of the Revised 1996
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories. at the level of its summary and sectoral tables.","Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks. as well as all gases,
included in the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas [nventories, as well as other existing relevant source/sink categories
which are specitic to individual Parties. and therefore may not be included in the [IPCC
Guidelines. Completeness also means full geographic coverage of sources and sinks of a Party .’","Accuracy is a relative measure of the exactness of an emission or removal estimate.
Estimates should be accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over or under true
emissions or removals. as far as can be judged. and that uncertainties are reduced as far as
practicable. Appropriate methodologies conforming to guidance on good practices should be
used to promote uccuracy in inventories.",C. Scope,"5. These UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories cover the estimation and
reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals of both annual inventories and inventories
included in national communications, as specified by decision 11/CP.4 and other relevant
‘decisions of the COP.","

7. Parties shall use the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. referred to below as the IPCC Guidelines,
to estimate and report on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of
greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In accordance with the TPCC
Guidelines. Parties may use different methods (tiers) included in those guidelines. giving priority
to those methods which are believed to produce the most accurate estimates, depending on the
data available. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. Parties can also use national
methodologies which they consider better able to reflect their national situation provided that
these methodologies are compatible with the IPCC Guidelines and are well documented.","8. The IPCC Guidelines offer a default methodology which includes default emission
factors and in some cases default activity data. As these default data. factors and assumptions
may not always be appropriate for specitic national contexts. it is preterable that Parties use their
own national emission factors and activity data. where available. provided that they are
developed in a manner consistent with any good practices. and considered to be more accurate,
and the reporting of the emission and removal estimates and their underlying data is transparent.",Good practices,"9. When preparing inventories. Parties should apply any good practices agreed upon by the
COP, in order to improve transparency. consistency, comparability. completeness and accuracy.",,,"FCCC/SBSTA/1999/6/Add.1
English
Page 8",Recalculations,"10.  The purpose of all recalculations should be the improvement of accuracy and/or
completeness. Recalculations have to ensure consistency of the time-series. The inventories of
an entire time-series. including the base vear and all subsequent years for which inventories have
been reported. should be estimated using the same methodologies. and the underlying activity
data and emission factors should be obtained and used in a consistent manner. Where the
methodology or manner in which underlying activity data and emission factors are gathered has
changed. Parties should recalculate inventories for the base and subsequent years.","1. However, in some cases activity data may be missing for some historical years, including","~ the base year. In this case. emissions or removals for these years may need to be recalculated
with alternative methodologies. In these instances, Parties should demonstrate that the time-
series is consistent. The alternative methodologies should be documented in a transparent
manner. taking into account any good practices.",Uncertainties,"12, Parties should estimate the uncertainties of their inventories using the best methodologies
available to them, taking account of any good practices.",F. Reporting,1. General guidance,Estimates of emissions and removals,"3. Article 12.1(a) of the Convention requires that each Party shall communicate to the COP.
through the secretariat. inter alia. a national inventory of anthropogenic emissions by sources
and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Ata
minimum. inventories shall contain information on the following six greenhouse gases: carbon
dioxide (CO.). methane (CH,). nitrous oxide (N,O). pertluorocarbons (PFCs).
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). and sulphur hexatluoride (SF,). Parties should report emissions and
removals of any other greenhouse gases whose 100-year global warming potential (GWP) values
have been identitied by the IPCC and adopted by the COP. Parties should also provide
information on the following indirect greenhouse gases: carbon monoxide (CO). nitrogen oxides
{NO,) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Parties are encouraged to
provide information on sulphur oxides (SO,).","14. Greenhouse gas emissions and removals should be presented on a gas-by-gas basis in
units of mass with emissions by sources listed separately from removals by sinks. except in cases
where it may be technically impossible to separate information on sources and sinks in the areas
of land-use. land-use change and forestry. For HFCs and PFCs. emissions should be reported for","

level.” using GWP values provided by the IPCC in its Second Assessment Report, referred to
below as 1995 IPCC GWP values, based on the effects of greenhouse gases over a 100-year time
horizon. A list of these values is given in table 1 at the end of this document. Table 1 will be
amended to include any additional greenhouse gases and their 100-year GWP values. once the
GWP values have been adopted by the COP.","
16. Consistent with decision 2/CP.3. Parties should report actual emissions of HFCs. PFCs
and SF,, where data are available. providing disaggregated data by chemical (for example.
HFC-134a) and source category in units of mass and in CO, equivalents. Parties should make
every effort to develop the necessary sources of data for reporting actual emissions. For the
source categories where the concept of potential emissions applies. and Parties do not yet have
the necessary data to calculate actual emissions. Parties should report disaggregated potential
emissions. Parties reporting actual emissions should also report potential emissions for the
sources where the concept of potential emissions applies. for reasons of transparency and
comparability.",,"17. Parties are strongly encouraged to also report emissions and removals of greenhouse
gases for which 100-year GWP values are available, but not yet adopted by the COP. These
emissions and removals should be reported separately from national totals. The GWP value and
reference should be indicated.","18. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. international aviation and marine bunker fuel
emissions. based upon fuel sold to ships or aircraft engaged in international transport. should not
be included in national totals. but reported separately. Parties should also report emissions from
international aviation and marine bunker fuels as two separate entries in their inventories.","19. Emissions and removals should be reported on the most disaggregated level of each
source/sink category. taking into account that a minimum level of aggregation may be required to
protect confidential business and military information.",,,,———,"3 CO. equivalent emissions should be provided at a level of disaggregation similar to summary table 7A of the
IPCC Guidelines.","FCCC/SBSTA/1999/6/Add.1

of changes in methodologies, changes in the manner in which emission factors and activity data
are obtained and used or the inclusion of new sources or sinks. which have existed since the base
year but were not previously reported. should be reported for the base year and all subsequent
years. up to the vear in which the recalculations are made. Recalculations should result in an
improvement in the accuracy and completeness of the inventory and ensure the consistency of
the time-series. In this regard, Parties should report justifications for these changes. The
information on the procedures used for performing the recalculations, changes in the calculation
methods. emission factors and activity data used. and inclusion of sources or sinks. should be
documented in a transparent manner, indicating the relevant changes in each source or sink
category where these changes have taken place.","
Completeness","21. Where methodological or data gaps in inventories exist. information on these gaps should
be presented in a transparent manner. Parties should clearly indicate the sources and sinks not
considered in their inventories but included in the IPCC Guidelines. and explain the reason for
the exclusion. In addition. Parties should use the standard indicators presented below to fill the
blanks in all the tables of an inventory. This approach facilitates assessment of the completeness
of'an inventory. The standard indicators are as follows:",-,"

greenhouse gases that do not occur for a particular gas or source/sink category within a country;","(b) “NE™ (not estimated) for existing emissions by sources and removals by sinks of
greenhouse gases which have not been estimated. Where ""NE” is used in an inventory for
emissions or removals of CO-, N-O. CH,, HFCs. PFCs, or SF,. the Party should indicate, using
the completeness table of the common reporting format. why emissions could not be estimated:","(c) “NA"" (not applicable) for activities in a given source/sink category that do not
result in emissions or removals of a specific gas. If categories in the common reporting format

both electronic form and hard copy. The common reporting format is part of the national
inventory report referred to in section 3 below.","28. The common reporting format is a standardized format for reporting estimates of
greenhouse gas emissions and removals and other relevant information. It will be provided to
Parties by the secretariat and will also be available on the UNFCCC Web site. The common
reporting format allows for the improved handling of electronic submissions and facilitates the
processing of inventory information and the preparation of useful technical analysis and
synthesis documentation.","

(Annex to the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories)","
Notes on the common reporting format","1. This common reporting format consists of summary, reporting and overview tables from
the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines).
plus newly developed sectoral background tables. Users of IPCC software and of the software
for converting from CORINAIR to [PCC formats should be aware that a few small additions
have been made to the tables taken from the IPCC Guidelines.","2. Some sectoral background tables call for the calculation of implied emission fuctors.
These are top-down ratios between the Party’s emissions estimate and aggregate activity data.
The implied emission factors are intended solely for purposes of comparison. They will not
necessarily be the emission factors actually used in the original emissions estimate, unless of
course this was a simple multiplication based on the same aggregate activity data used to
calculate the implied emission factor.","3. Consistent with the [PCC Guidelines. memo items. such as emissions estimates from
international marine and aviation bunker fuels. should be reported in the appropriate tables, but
not included in national totals.","
4. Parties should use the documentation boxes provided at the foot of the sectoral
background tables to improve clarity.","5. Parties should complete all cells calling for emissions or removals estimates. activity data
or emission tactors. The tollowing standard indicators should be used where data are not
entered.",,"
(a) “NO™ (not occurring) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of
greenhouse gases that do not occur for a particular gas or source/sink category within a country:","(b) “NE™ (not estimated) for existing emissions by sources and removal by sinks of
greenhouse gases which have not been estimated. Where ""NE™ is used in an inventory for
emissions or removals of CO.. N,O. CH,. HFCs. PFCs. or SF.. the Party should indicate. using
the completeness table 9. why emissions could not be estimated:","
(c) “NA™ (not applicable) for activities in a given source/sink category that do not
result in emissions or removals of a specific gas. [f categories in the common reporting format
for which ""NA™ is applicable are shaded. they do not need to be filled in:","FCCC/SBSTA/1999/6/Add. 1
English
Page 18","(d) “IE” (included elsewhere) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of
greenhouse gases estimated but included elsewhere in the inventory instead of the expected
source/sink categorv. Where ""IE” is used in an inventory. the Party should indicate using the
completeness table 9. where in the inventory the emissions or removals from the displaced
source/sink category have been included and the Party should give the reasons for this inclusion
deviating trom the expected category:;",,,"
(e) “C"" (confidential) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse
gases which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, given the provisions of
paragraph 19 of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories;","(f) “0” for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which
are estimated to be less than one half the unit being used to record the inventory table, and which
would therefore appear as zero after rounding. The amount should still be included in the
relevant subtotals. In the sectoral background tables, Parties should provide data as detailed as
methods allow.","6. Parties should complete the data in the additional information boxes. Where the
information called for is inappropriate because of the methodological tier used by the Party. the
corresponding cells should be completed using the indicator ""NA™.","7. Table 3 (the land-use change and forestry sectoral report) should be completed by Parties.
The corresponding sectoral background tables 5 A-D follow the IPCC Guidelines and should be
completed by Parties that use [PCC detault methods. The species and ecosystem types given in
the background tables are examples and may be changed by Parties to better describe national
circumstances. Parties which do not use the sectoral background tables 5 A-D should complete
alternative formats. when they are available.","8. Neither the order nor the notation of columns. rows or cells should be changed in the
tables because this will complicate data compilation. Any additions to the existing
disaggregation of source and sink categories should be made using the spare rows and columns
provided. Additional changes that are made should be clearly indicated both by using a red font
and by underlining the information contained in changed cells.","
9. Where recalculations of previously submitted data are necessary for the reasons set out in
paragraphs 10 and 11 of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. Parties should -
-complete recalculation table 8a for every vear from the base year, and table 8b. Parties should
also complete the other tables of the common reporting format for the base year which have
changed due to the recalculations. -",,,"
