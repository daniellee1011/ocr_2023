The establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was proposed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit, held in June 2009. The Heads of State and Government of the States members of ASEAN and of the Republic of Korea expressed appreciation for and welcomed the proposal. 2. A number of sessions were organized among the forestry officials of 11 countries over a period of two years to negotiate the text of the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of ASEAN and the Republic of Korea on Forest Cooperation. The Agreement was formally signed at the fourteenth ASEAN- Republic of Korea Summit on 18 November 2011 and came into effect on 5 August 2012. II. New dialogue initiative 3. A new dialogue on the establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was organized on a multilateral platform, with invitations sent to Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Timor-Leste. The platform covered a wide range of geographically diverse areas, ranging from coastal islands and glaciated mountains to central Asian deserts. The Agreement on the Establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was negotiated through six successive dialogues held between 2013 and 2015 among States members and prospective members of ASEAN. The Agreement was adopted on 22 September 2015 by 14 countries: Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Timor- Leste and Viet Nam. It entered into force on 27 April 2018. 4. The aim of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is to strengthen forest cooperation by transforming proven technologies and policies into concrete actions in the area of sustainable forest management, in order to address the impact of climate change. Il. Membership 5. As of July 2020, the following 13 countries had ratified and deposited their instruments and are officially registered as members of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization: ¢ Bhutan ¢ Brunei Darussalam ¢ Kazakhstan ¢ Lao People’s Democratic Republic * Mongolia ¢ Myanmar ¢ Philippines 3/21 A/75/192 7. In accordance with article 5 of the Agreement, membership is open to countries geographically located in Asia. The Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is open to engaging with partner countries beyond the region. IV. Purpose and function 8. The vision of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is that of a greener Asia with resilient forests, landscapes and communities. Its missions are to strengthen cooperation among member countries and global and regional players in the forest sector, and to promote action-oriented sustainable forest management practices through policy support, capacity development and inclusive partnerships, in order to address the adverse impacts of climate change. 9. These missions are realized through the implementation of programmes and projects to address environmental degradation in member countries that is compounded by the changing climate. In its plans and actions, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization adheres to the core values of partnership, member- centrality, transparency, competency, equity and sustainability. Its five-year strategic plan identifies the following priority areas of intervention: (a) The initiation of customized restoration and reforestation models; (b) Support for research and development in climate change adaptation approaches; (c) Systematic management of forest-related disasters; (d) The improvement of local livelihoods and the development of community- based small enterprises; (ec) The strengthening of institutional capabilities, the diversification of resources and the promotion of regional actions. 10. As an outcome, the actions taken by the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization contribute to the achievement of broader global targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals; the global forest goals; nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Aichi Biodiversity Targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity; the land degradation neutrality targets of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; and the Bonn Challenge. Response to the efforts of global community in the forest sector 11. As noted in the background study prepared for the fourteenth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, forests are the second largest storehouses of carbon, absorbing and storing about 30 per cent of current levels of carbon emissions in their biomass, soil and wood, and have the potential to store much more. However, forests also account for greenhouse gas emissions as a result of deforestation caused 4/21 A/75/192 by forest fires, diseases and pests. By mainly focusing on the forest sector, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization has unique strengths and potential as an intergovernmental organization, since its member counties are in the Asian region, which includes diverse landscapes, ranging from glaciated high mountains and drylands to one of the world’s largest tropical forests. 12. As identified in its strategic plan, the priority intervention areas of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization are in keeping with efforts by the global community to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It implements activities directly linked to the global forest goals set out in the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030 and translates them into actions on the ground in the Asian region. Reflecting the needs of its member countries, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization implements projects that protect and restore degraded forests and increases the involvement of local communities in forest-related activities in order to improve their livelihoods and help them to practice sustainable forest management. 13. The Asian Forest Cooperation Organization also implements biodiversity conservation projects, including activities for ecosystem services and for the conservation of genetic resources. It further aims to contribute to global biodiversity goals by taking account of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. VI. Programmes and projects 14. Since 2011, under the partnership between ASEAN and the Republic of Korea in the forest sector, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization has embarked on many capacity-building programmes, subregional projects and individual country-driven projects. Nearly $32 million has been contributed to areas ranging from policy support interventions to engaging villagers in forest restoration and rehabilitation activities. The objectives of (a) capacity-building programmes; (b) seven subregional projects; and (c) three projects in individual countries, all of which primarily contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 15, are highlighted below: (a) Capacity-building programmes 15. Many training courses have been conducted to strengthen the capacities of diverse stakeholder groups of the member countries of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization by enhancing knowledge and understanding of forest management and providing better access to relevant information, skills and technology. 16.

Rights of the child: realizing the rights of the child through a healthy environment,"The Human Rights Council, Emphasizing that the Convention on the Rights of the Child constitutes the international legal foundation for the respect, protection and fulfilment of the rights of the child, bearing in mind the importance of the Optional Protocols to the Convention, and calling for their universal ratification and effective implementation, Recalling all previous resolutions on the rights of the child of the Commission on Human Rights, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, the most recent being Council resolutions 40/14 of 22 March 2019 and 43/22 of 22 June 2020, and Assembly resolution 74/133 of 18 December 2019, Welcoming the convening of commemorative events to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the progress made over the years in safeguarding the rights of the child, Recalling all other relevant international human rights treaties, in particular the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Convention on the Elimination of All GE.20-12837(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Reaffirming that the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the best interests of the child, non-discrimination, participation, survival and development, provide the framework for all actions concerning children, Reaffirming also that the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires its States parties to pursue the full implementation of the rights of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution, and that States parties have agreed that the education of the child shall be directed to, among others, the development of respect for the natural environment, Recalling the 2016 Day of General Discussion of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which focused on the contents and the implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child with regard to environmental matters, and taking note of its outcome report and recommendations, Welcoming the attention paid by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council to the rights of the child in the context of their respective mandates, in particular the work of the Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Reaffirming that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, that the best interests of the child shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his or her nurture and protection, and that families’ and caregivers’ capacities to provide the child with care and a safe environment should be promoted, including in the context of natural disasters, the adverse impacts of climate change or other forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1. Welcomes the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on realizing the rights of the child through a healthy environment;! 2.

A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 (g) Integrating gender-responsive measures into their laws, policies and programmes relevant to the protection of children from the effects of environmental harm, including addressing sexual and gender-based violence risks; 5. Also urges States to ensure that children enjoy the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, without discrimination of any kind, including sexual and reproductive health, throughout their life course, by inter alia: (a) Ensuring the availability, quality, accessibility and acceptability of health information and goods, and of health-care services; (b) | Taking measures to ensure that the underlying determinants of health, such as food, water and housing, are free from hazardous substances; (c) Identifying and eliminating sources of exposure of children to indoor and outdoor air pollution and substances of high concern, such as heavy metals and endocrine disrupting chemicals; (d) — Ensuring that all children, in particular girls, are guaranteed protection from occupational exposure to hazardous substances and wastes; (e) Taking all necessary measures to protect children from the health, social, and economic consequences of epidemics and pandemics by integrating the rights of the child into national contingency and recovery plans; 6. Further urges States to take effective measures to ensure that all children in vulnerable situations can exercise their rights on an equal basis with other children, and that the effects of environmental harm do not affect them disproportionately, including by strengthening the collection of disaggregated data, by requiring that childhood exposure monitoring and children’s rights impact assessment procedures take fully into account the impact of proposed policies, programmes and projects on those in the most vulnerable situations, including their gender dimensions, and by providing children at particular risk and their parents, or primary caregivers and legal guardians with assistance in accessing effective remedies; 7.
