These meetings could include private dialogues with representatives of concerned States; (c) At the conclusion of this annual Bureau review meeting, the Bureau would conduct a public briefing for representatives of all Commission members on any observations or conclusions it may consider appropriate to report.

RECOMMENDATION 12: (a) Reflecting the role of the Sub-Commission in assisting the Commission to address a broad range of human rights issues, it should be renamed “the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights”; (b) Reflecting the proposed sharpening of the Sub-Commission's role as an independent expert body focusing its attention on priorities determined by the Commission: (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to consultation with the Bureau, qualifications, to serve a four-year term, maximum of one additional four-year term. on the basis of their expert renewable for a To preserve the image of the Sub-Commission as an independent expert body, no member should be concurrently employed in the executive branch of their country's Government; (ii) The length of annual sessions of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to two weeks; (c) The Sub-Commission's work and priorities should be based on tasks entrusted to it by the Commission on Huma on the elaboration of studies, research a n Rights, with the principal focus nd expert advice at the request of the Commission. The Commission should regard the Sub-Commission's experts as i1ts foremost resource for the performa than appointing others to undertak considering the assignment of projec nce of such assignments, rather xpert research and analysis; and in ts to the Sub-Commission, the Commission might consider relevant proposals from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, from other United Nations human righ CS institutions and from the Sub-Commission itself; (d) The Sub-Commission's wor and study projects should, consistent king methods in respect of its research with th independent xpert character of (ii) the body, entail a well-prepared, thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question, any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission. This approach would preclude the need for negotiating traditional resolutions for submission to the Commission. While the Sub-Commission's deliberations should provide opportunities for interested Governments, international organizations and NGOs to provide input into this process, the experts should also be prepared to dedicate adequate time to private deliberations on their projects, inter alia in the framework of sessional working groups such as the existing working group on the administration of justice; (e) Recognizing the important opportunities the Sub-Commission and some of its subsidiary bodies play in affording a public forum for concerned parties to raise their human rights concerns: (1) The Sub-Commission should continue to conduct an annual debate on human rights violations in all parts of the world. However, rather than leading to the negotiation of resolutions, this debate should be reflected in a summary to the Commission as part of the Sub-Commission's annual report; (i1) The Sub-Commission's inter-sessional Working Groups on Minorities and on Indigenous Populations should continue to perform the valuable work they ar ngaged in, the latter until such time as the question of its future status is resolved in the context of the Commission's deliberations on a permanent forum for indigenous people in the United Nations system. The question of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery is addressed in recommendation 1 above; (f) As regards transitional arrangements associated with these proposed changes, the Bureau recommends that the Commission devise a transitional process aimed at bringing the recommended reforms fully into effect for the fifty-second session of the Sub-Commission in the year 2000. RECOMMENDATION 13: (a) Before referring any matter to a working group, the Commission on Human Rights should, where the needed groundwork has not been otherwise laid, request the Sub-Commission to undertake a study on the question at hand and (ii) prepare a text of the instrument envisaged. Among the issues to be addressed in any such study, and in the Commission's deliberations on whether to proceed, careful consideration should be given to the purposes of any ing exercise and to the guidelines set out in General Assembly resolution 41/120; (b) In creating any standard-setting working group, the Commission should consider and agree on a specific time-frame within which the group would be called upon to complete its task. This could vary depending on the complexity of the issue and the nature of the instrument (e.g. a procedural protocol might reasonably be completed within two or three years), but in any event the established time-frame should not exceed five years. If, by the end of its mandate, the working group has not been able to achieve a result, the Commission should set a period of reflection (such as one or two years) before any extension is provided; (c) Regarding the question of concluding a standard-setting exercise with or without a vote, it should be borne in mind that there is no rule of procedure requiring the Commission on Human Rights, ECOSOC or the General Assembly to adopt standard-setting instruments by consensus, and there are indeed examples where consensus has not been achieved. O0Of course, all efforts should be made at reaching consensus; (d) Finally, all working group chairs (whose terms should be linked with that of the working group) should have standing authority to undertake, between working group meetings, informal contacts and consultations with a view to advancing progress in respect of the working group's mandate. Results of such consultations should be communicated to concerned delegations on a timely basis and at the start of each session.",04/23/1999,1999_1489910,Luxembourg,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council. 1503 procedure be amended in the following ways: 15 members, nominated by the Chair of the Commission in",yes

The Action Plan is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.?! It allows for flexible approaches to reflect social, cultural, religious and political differences, and it acknowledges that efforts to reduce illicit drug demand are at different levels of implementation in different countries. 5. The Action Plan recognizes that progress to reduce the demand for illicit drugs should be seen in the context of the need for programmes to reduce the demand for substances of abuse. Such programmes should be integrated to promote cooperation between all concerned, should include a wide variety of appropriate interventions, should promote health and social well-being among individuals, families and communities, and should reduce the adverse consequences of drug abuse for the individual and for society as a whole. 6. The Action Plan focuses on the need to design demand reduction campaigns and programmes to meet the needs of the population in general, as well as those of specific population groups, taking into account differences in gender, culture and education and 20 This may include, but is not restricted to, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, the Joint United Nations Programme on Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the International Labour Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Health Organization, as well as international financial institutions such as the World Bank. 2!
