Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens’ entitlement to public information. Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data. Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics. Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents. Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes. Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be made public. Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system. Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries. 2 For the original preamble used on the occasion of the initial adoption of the Principles in 1994, see the report of the Statistical Commission on its special session (E/1994/29), chapter V.

including in peacebuilding missions or operations, due diligence which addresses the issue of violence against women in a comprehensive manner by not only criminalizing violence against women and girls and providing for punishment of the perpetrators, but also including protection and preventive measures and provisions for redress and reparations for victims and survivors of violence against women and girls, with provisions for adequate funding for their implementation, Reaffirming the importance of effective accountability with regard to violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, abuse and exploitation, and of undertaking adequate measures to combat such violence, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between men and women and that all forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to women’s full and active contribution to society, Recognizing also that women’s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women impedes the social, economic and therefore sustainable development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, Acknowledging the need to address violence against women and girls holistically, including through the recognition of linkages between violence against women and girls and other issues, such as HIV/AIDS, poverty eradication, food security, peace and security, humanitarian assistance, education, access to justice, health and crime prevention, Acknowledging also that trafficking in persons is one of the forms of transnational organized crime which exposes women to violence and that concerted efforts are needed to combat it, and in this regard stressing that full and effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,** as well as the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons,?> will contribute to the elimination of all forms of violence

including awareness-raising and capacity-building, such as through training for criminal justice professionals and education, providing support and services for women facing or subjected to violence and improving data collection and analysis, 24 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2237, No. 39574. 25 Resolution 64/293. 4/12 Recognizing that domestic violence and intimate partner violence remain widespread and affect women of all social strata across the world and the need to eliminate such violence, Recognizing also the important role of the family and the community, in particular men and

Stresses that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute, provide for redress and reparations for and hold to account the perpetrators of violence against women and girls and eliminate impunity and should ensure the protection and the empowerment of women and girls, including adequate enforcement by police and the judiciary of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women subjected to violence; 5/12 8.

Reaffirms that the persistence of armed conflicts in various parts of the world is a major impediment to the elimination of all forms of violence against women, and, bearing in mind that armed and other types of conflicts and terrorism and hostage-taking still persist in many parts of the world and that aggression, foreign occupation and ethnic and other types of conflicts are an ongoing reality, affecting women and men in nearly every region, calls upon all States and the international community to place particular focus on the plight, and give priority attention and increased assistance to relieving the suffering, of women and girls living in such situations and to ensure that, where violence is committed against them, all perpetrators of such violence are duly investigated and, as appropriate, prosecuted and punished in order to end impunity, including within peacekeeping missions and operations, while stressing the need to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law, and calls upon all States to apply the definition of sexual and gender- based violence, as set out in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court;”” 13. Stresses the need for the exclusion of killing and maiming of women and girls, as prohibited under international law, and crimes of sexual violence from amnesty provisions in the context of conflict resolution processes and to address such acts committed during all stages of the armed conflict and post-conflict resolution process, including through transitional justice, while ensuring the full and effective participation of women in such processes; 14. Also stresses that in armed conflict and post-conflict situations the prevention of and response to all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, must be prioritized and effectively addressed, including, as appropriate, through the investigation, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators to end impunity, the removal of barriers to women’s access to justice, the 26 A/69/222. 27 See A/69/368. 6/12 establishment of complaint and reporting mechanisms, the provision of support to victims, affordable and accessible health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health, and reintegration measures, and that steps must be taken to increase women’s participation in conflict resolution and peacebuilding missions and processes and post-conflict decision-making; 15. Further stresses that, despite important steps taken by many countries around the world, States should continue to focus on the implementation of laws and policies for ending violence against women and girls, including the prevention of violence against women and girls, as well as their protection and the provision of services, and should therefore monitor and rigorously evaluate the implementation of available programmes, policies and laws and improve, where possible, their impact, accessibility and effectiveness; 16. Stresses that States should take measures to ensure that all officials responsible for implementing policies and programmes aimed at preventing violence against women and girls, protecting and assisting the victims and investigating and punishing acts of violence receive ongoing and adequate training and access to information to sensitize them to the different and specific needs of women and girls, in particular those who have been subjected to violence, so that women and girls are not revictimized when seeking justice and redress, including in peacekeeping missions and processes; 17. Also stresses that States should take all possible measures to empower and protect women against all forms of violence, to inform them of their human rights, including by disseminating information on the assistance available to women and families who have experienced violence and ensuring that timely and appropriate information is available to all women who have been subjected to violence, including at all levels of the justice system, and to inform everyone of women’s rights and of the existing penalties for violating those rights; 18. Expresses grave concern that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing gender-based violence, including sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination; 19. Calls upon States, with the support of United Nations entities, to fully engage men and boys, as well as families and communities, as partners and agents of change in preventing and condemning violence against women and girls, as well as in achieving gender equality, and to develop appropriate policies to promote the responsibility and role of men and boys in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls; 20.

and welcoming therefore the emphasis placed by States on the topic of sanitation, for instance in General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, in which States committed to, inter alia, redouble efforts to close the sanitation gap through scaled-up ground-level action, as well as the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of Sanitation for All, pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Concerned that the official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions as a critical part of securing access to safe drinking water as well as the safe management of sanitation, Reaffirming that non-discrimination and equality are fundamental human rights principles, and concerned that inequalities in the realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation persist, inter alia, between urban and rural areas and between formal and informal areas in cities, and insisting that much remains to be done on safety, equality and non-discrimination issues, Concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including menstrual hygiene management, and the widespread stigma associated with menstruation have a negative impact on gender equality and the human rights of women and girls, Recognizing that, in realizing the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights for a rapidly growing world population, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Recalling General Assembly resolution 67/291, entitled “Sanitation for All”, in which the Assembly encouraged all Member States, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including hygiene promotion, the provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage and wastewater treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management, Affirming the need to adequately consider the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while defining concrete goals, targets and indicators, Reaffirming its encouragement to Member States to intensify global partnerships for development as a means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation, Reaffirming also the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and A/HRC/27/L.11/Rev.1 affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity; 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is essential for the full enjoyment of life and to all human rights, and recalls that it is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and is inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and human dignity; 2. Recalls that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 3. Alarmed by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign “Sustainable sanitation: the five- year drive to 2015”, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 4. Welcomes the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals proposed in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater treatment, and that special attention be given to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, and invites States to consider adequately the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; 5. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and the undertaking of country missions; 6.

the Kathmandu Declaration, adopted at the fifth South Asian Conference on Sanitation, in 2013; and the commitments made on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation at the Sanitation and Water for All High-Level Meeting, in 2014, Taking note with appreciation of the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2014 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Welcoming the fact that, according to the 2012 Joint Monitoring Programme report of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund, the Millennium Development Goal target relating to the reduction by 50 per cent of people without access to an improved water source was formally met five years before its deadline of 2015, while being deeply concerned, however, that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, a large number of the world’s population still does not enjoy access to safe drinking water, as 748 million people, nearly half of them in sub-Saharan Africa, still lack access to improved drinking-water sources, and that at least 1.8 billion people are estimated to be using an improved or unimproved drinking water source that is unsafe, Deeply concerned that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, more than 2.5 billion people still do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, including | billion people who still practice open defecation, and that the world remains off track to meet the sanitation component of Millennium Development Goal 7, which called for halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to an improved A/HRC/27/L.11 sanitation facility; and welcoming therefore the emphasis placed by States on the topic of sanitation, for instance in General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, in which States committed to, inter alia, redouble efforts to close the sanitation gap through scaled-up ground-level action, as well as the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of Sanitation for All, pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Concerned that the official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions as a critical part of securing access to safe drinking water as well as the safe management of sanitation, Reaffirming that non-discrimination and equality are fundamental human rights principles, and concerned that inequalities in the realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation persist, inter alia, between urban and rural areas and between formal and informal areas in cities, and insisting that much remains to be done on safety, equality and non-discrimination issues, Concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including menstrual hygiene management, and the widespread stigma associated with menstruation have a negative impact on gender equality and the human rights of women and girls, Recognizing that, in realizing the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights for a rapidly growing world population, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches, such as the water, energy-and food security nexus, and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Recalling General Assembly resolution 67/291, entitled “Sanitation for All”, in which the Assembly encouraged all Member States, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including hygiene promotion, the provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage and wastewater treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management, Affirming the need to adequately consider the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while defining concrete goals, targets and indicators, Reaffirming its encouragement to Member States to intensify global partnerships for development as a means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation, Reaffirming also the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is essential for the full enjoyment of life and to all human rights, and recalling that it is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and is inextricably related to the right to the highest A/HRC/27/L.11 attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and human dignity, 1. Recalls that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 2. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity; 3. Alarmed by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign “Sustainable sanitation: the five- year drive to 2015”, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 4. Welcomes the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals proposed in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater treatment, and that special attention be given to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, and invites States to reflect adequately the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the post-2015 development agenda; 5. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and the undertaking of country missions; 6.

the Human Rights Committee on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption, Recognizing the need for further discussion and in-depth study of issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age and to procedural safeguards, effective oversight and remedies, with a view to further practical guidance, grounded in international human rights law, on the principles of necessity, proportionality and legitimacy, Noting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, “NETmundial”, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 23 and 24 April 2014, taking note of the outcome of that meeting, which reiterated, inter alia, the need for human rights to underpin Internet governance and that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, and recognizing that effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology will require an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Noting also that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communication technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information and democratic participation, Concerned that other human rights, such as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to seek, receive and impart information, the right to

data, and highlighting the need to further consider the linkages between mass surveillance and its effects on other human rights, 6 A/69/397. 7 A/HRC/23/40 and Corr.1. 2/4 Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, including data about communications, known as metadata, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, especially when undertaken on a mass scale, Noting that while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory and that any interference with the right to privacy must be necessary and proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims and not impair the essence of the right, Noting that surveillance, the interception of digital communications and/or the collection of personal data that involves a State’s exercise of power or effective control over communications infrastructure, regardless of its location, may engage its human rights obligations relating to the right to privacy, Emphasizing that the human rights obligations of a State regarding the right to privacy extend to the exercise of its regulatory jurisdiction over private parties that physically control data, regardless of their location, Recalling that private enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights and to prevent and address the adverse impacts of their activities on human rights, as set out, notably, in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, ® Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, 1.

Calls upon all States: (a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital communication; (b) To take measures to put an end to violations of those rights and to create the conditions to prevent such violations, including by ensuring that relevant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human rights law; (c) To review their procedures, practices and legislation regarding the surveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal data, including mass surveillance, interception and collection, with a view to upholding the right to privacy by ensuring the full and effective implementation of all their obligations under international human rights law; (d) To establish or maintain existing independent, effective, adequately resourced and impartial judicial, administrative and/or parliamentary domestic oversight mechanisms capable of ensuring transparency, as appropriate, and accountability for State surveillance of communications, their interception and the collection of personal data, including metadata; (e) To provide individuals whose right to privacy has been violated as a consequence of individual or mass_ surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as individual or mass collection and storage of personal data, including metadata, access to effective remedy, without discrimination; 5.
