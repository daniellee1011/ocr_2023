Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe",N/A,The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts,"The General Assembly, Recognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds is a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in, and proliferation of, armaments, especially small arms and light weapons, Also recognizing the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts, Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security, Recognizing therefore that urgent action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, Also recognizing the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for urgent international action to prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a critical contribution to the economies of many of the producing, exporting and importing States, especially developing States, Noting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from legitimate sources, Recalling all the resolutions related to conflict diamonds of the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter, and determined to contribute to and support the implementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions, Also recalling its resolution 55/56 of 1 December 2000, in which it called upon the international community to develop detailed proposals for a simple and workable international certification scheme for rough diamonds based primarily on national certification schemes and on internationally agreed minimum standards, Believing that the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict can be substantially reduced by introducing an international certification scheme for rough diamonds and that such a scheme would help protect legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on trade in conflict diamonds, Emphasizing that the envisaged international certification scheme for rough diamonds should be simple, effective and pragmatic, should not impede the present legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and should not hinder the development of the diamond industry, Acknowledging the important initiatives already taken to address the problem of conflict diamonds, in particular by the Governments of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea and Sierra Leone and by other key producing, exporting and importing countries, and encouraging those Governments to continue the initiatives, Also acknowledging the continued efforts of regional organizations and other groups of countries to curb conflict diamonds, Welcoming the important contribution made by the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council, as well as civil society, to assist international efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds, Also welcoming voluntary self-regulation initiatives for the diamond industry announced by the World Diamond Council, and recognizing that a system of such voluntary self-regulation will contribute to ensuring the effectiveness of national systems of internal controls for rough diamonds, Recognizing that an international certification scheme for rough diamonds will only be credible if all participants have established internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices as well as differences in institutional controls thereof may require different approaches to meet minimum standards, Welcoming the important contribution made by the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African producing countries towards developing proposals for the envisaged international certification scheme, A/56/L.72 Noting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis, involving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing States, the diamond industry and civil society, Recognizing that State sovereignty

Welcomes the detailed proposals for an international certification scheme for rough diamonds developed in the Kimberley Process and presented in the form of Kimberley Process working document 9/2001 (as amended), entitled “Essential elements of an international scheme of certification for rough diamonds, with a view to breaking the link hetween armed conflict and the trade in rough diamonds”, dated 29 November 2001,% which provide a good basis for the proposed certification scheme; 4. Encourages the Kimberley Process to resolve outstanding issues; 5. Emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the measures taken to implement the international certification scheme for rough diamonds are consistent with international law governing international trade; 6. Urges the finalization of the international certification scheme, and its subsequent implementation, as soon as possible, recognizing the urgency of the situation from a humanitarian and security standpoint; 7. Underlines the need, as an essential tool for the successful implementation of the proposed international certification scheme, for the collation and dissemination of relevant statistical data on the production of, and international trade in, rough diamonds; 8. Supports the extension of the work of the Kimberley Process until such time as an international certification scheme is adopted and its simultancous implementation by participants begins; 9. Urges Member States to participate actively in the proposed international certification scheme, and stresses that the widest possible participation in the proposed international certification scheme is essential and should be encouraged and facilitated; 10. Welcomes the offer by the Government of Canada to host the next meeting of the Kimberley Process in Ottawa, in order to achieve further progress; 1 See A/56/502, A/56/675 and A/56/775. 2 See A/56/775, annex VIII.

S/2002/532 Procedures 1-— The following procedures replace paragraphs 29 to 34 of document S/1996/636* and other existing procedures, notably for the implementation of the relevant provisions of paragraphs 17, 18 and 25 of resolution 1284 (1999) related to the processing of applications to be financed from the escrow account established pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution 986 (1995). > Each application (the “Notification or Request to Ship Goods to Iraq,” as attached to these procedures, hereafter referred to as “the application,”) for the sale or supply of commodities or products, to include services ancillary to the supply of such commodities and products, to Iraq to be financed from the escrow account established pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution 986 (1995) must be forwarded to the Office of the Iraq Programme (OIP) by the exporting States through permanent or observer Missions, or by United Nations agencies and programmes. Each application should include complete technical specifications, as requested in the standard application form, concluded arrangements (e.g., contracts), and other relevant information, including, if known, whether the application contains any item(s) covered by the Goods Review List (GRL), in order for a determination to be made on whether the application contains any item referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, or military-related commodities or products covered by the GRL. Each application will be reviewed and registered by OIP within 10 working days. In the case of a technically incomplete application, OIP may request additional information before transmitting the application to the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If OIP determines that the requested information is not provided within 90 days, the application will be considered supplier-inactive and no further action on the application will be taken until the information is provided. If the requested information is not received within a further 90 days, the application will lapse. OIP should notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency in writing of any change in the status of the application. The OIP will identify an official to act as a contact point on each application. After OIP registration of the application, each application will be evaluated by technical experts from UNMOVIC and IAEA in order to determine whether the application contains any item referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, or military- related commodities or products covered by the GRL (“GRL item(s)”). At their discretion and subject to the approval of the 661 Committee, UNMOVIC and IAEA may issue guidance regarding what categories of applications do not contain any item(s) covered by paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, or military-related commodities or products covered by the GRL. UNMOVIC, IAEA and OIP, working in consultation, may develop a procedure whereby OIP may evaluate and approve applications that, based on this guidance, fall within these categories. Military goods and services are prohibited for sale or supply to Iraq under paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) and are not subject to review under the GRL. For consideration of dual-use goods and services referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991), UNMOVIC and IAEA should process these goods and services pursuant to paragraph 9 of these procedures. Upon receipt of a registered application from OIP, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will have 10 working days to evaluate an application as set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5. Absent action by UNMOVIC and/or IAEA within the 10-working-day period, the application will be considered approved. In the course of conducting the technical evaluation as set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 above, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA may request additional information from the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. The submitting Mission or United Nations agency should provide the additional information requested within a period of 90 days. Once UNMOVIC and/or IAEA receive the requested information, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will have 10 working days to evaluate the application under the procedure set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5. S/2002/532 7 — If UNMOVIC and/or IAEA determine that the submitting Mission or United Nations agency has not provided the requested additional information within the 90-day period set out in paragraph 6 above, the application will be considered supplier-inactive and no further action on the application will be taken until the information is provided. If the requested information is not provided within a further 90 days, the application will lapse. OIP should notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency in writing of any change in the status of the application. If UNMOVIC and/or IAEA determine that the application contains any item referred to in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, the application shall be considered ineligible for approval for the sale or supply to Iraq. UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will provide to the submitting Mission or United Nations agency through OIP a written explanation of this determination. If UNMOVIC and/or IAEA determine that the application contains any GRL item(s), they will immediately inform through OIP the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. Pursuant to paragraph 11 below, absent a request by the submitting Mission or United Nations agency for reconsideration within 10 working days, OIP will forward the application containing the GRL item(s) to the 661 Committee for the purpose of evaluating whether the GRL item(s) may be sold or supplied to Iraq. UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will provide to the 661 Committee through OIP a written explanation of this determination. In addition, OIP, UNMOVIC and/or IAEA, at the request of the submitting Mission or United Nations agency, will provide to the 661 Committee an assessment of the humanitarian, economic and security implications, of the approval or denial of the GRL item(s), including the viability of the whole contract in which the GRL item(s) appears and the risk of diversion of the item(s) for military purposes. The assessment provided by OIP to the Committee should be transmitted in parallel by OIP to the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. OIP will immediately inform appropriate United Nations agents of the finding of a GRL item(s) in the application and that the GRL item(s) may not be sold or supplied to Iraq unless otherwise notified by OIP that the procedures set forth in paragraphs 11 or 12 have resulted in approval for sale or supply of the GRL item(s) to Iraq. The remaining items in the application, which are determined as not covered by the GRL, will be considered approved for sale or supply to Iraq and, at the discretion of the submitting Mission or United Nations agency, and with the consent of the contracting parties, will be processed according to the procedure in paragraph 10 below. The relevant approval letter may be issued for such approved items under request from the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. If UNMOVIC and/or TAEA determine that the application does not contain any item referred to in paragraph 4 above, OIP will inform immediately the Government of Iraq and the submitting Mission or United Nations agency in written form. The exporter will be eligible for payment from the escrow account established pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution 986 (1995) upon verification by United Nations agents that the items in the application have arrived in Iraq as contracted. OIP and the United Nations Treasury will inform the banks within five working days that the items in the application have arrived in Iraq. If the Mission or United Nations agency submitting an application disagrees with the determination that an application contains an item(s) covered by paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) as it relates to military commodities and products, or military-related commodities or products covered by the GRL, it may request a reconsideration of this decision, based on the provision of technical information and/or explanations not previously included in the application, within 10 working days to OIP. In that event, UNMOVIC and/or TAEA will reconsider the item(s) in accordance with the procedures set out in paragraphs 4 to 6 above. The decision of UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will be final and no further reconsideration will be permitted. UNMOVIC and/or IAEA will provide to the 661 Committee through OIP a written explanation of the final decision of the reconsideration process. Applications shall not be forwarded to the 661 Committee until the reconsideration period has expired without a request being filed. S/2002/532 12— Upon receipt of an application pursuant to paragraphs 9 or 11 above, the 661 Committee will have 10 working days to determine under existing procedures whether the item(s) may be sold or supplied to Iraq. The Committee may take a decision on an item(s) according to the following options: (a) Approval; (b) Approval subject to conditions as stipulated by the Committee; (c) Denial; (d) Request for additional information. Absent action by the Committee within the 10-working-day period, the application will be considered approved. A Committee member may request additional information. If the additional information is not provided in a 90-day period, the item(s) will be considered supplier-inactive and no further action on the application will be taken until the information is provided. If the requested information is not provided within a further 90 days, the application will be considered lapsed. OIP should notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency in writing of any change in the status of the application. The Committee will have 20 working days to evaluate the requested additional information once provided by the submitting Mission or United Nations agency. Absent action by the Committee during the 20-working-day period, the item will be considered approved. Where the 661 Committee does not approve an item(s) for sale or supply to Iraq, the Committee will notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency with an explanation through OIP accordingly. The submitting Mission or United Nations agency will have 30 working days to petition OIP to have the 661 Committee reconsider its decision based on new information not previously included in the application as reviewed by the 661 Committee. A decision by the 661 Committee on a petition received during this period shall be made within five working days and shall be considered final. Absent such a petition within 30 working days, the item will be considered ineligible for sale or supply to Iraq and OIP will notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency accordingly. If an item(s) is found ineligible for sale or supply to Iraq or is considered lapsed, the supplier may submit a new application based on either a new or an amended contract, and the new application will be evaluated under the procedures enumerated in this document and will append the original application (for information purposes only and to facilitate review). If an item(s) is substituted for an item(s) that is either found ineligible for sale or supply to Iraq or is considered lapsed, the new item(s) will be submitted as a new application under the procedures enumerated in this document and will append the original application (for information purposes only and to facilitate review). Experts from OIP, UNMOVIC and IAEA who evaluate applications should be drawn from the broadest possible geographical base. The United Nations Secretariat will report to the 661 Committee at the end of each phase on the status of all applications submitted during this period, including contracts recirculated pursuant to paragraph 18 below. The Secretariat will provide to members of the 661 Committee at their request copies of applications approved by OIP, UNMOVIC and IAEA, within three working days after their approval, for information purposes only. S/2002/532 18 — OIP will divide contracts currently on hold into two categories — category A and category B. Category A will contain contracts on hold that have been designated by UNMOVIC as containing item(s) on one or more of the UNSCR resolution 1051 lists. Category A will also contain contracts that were both processed before the Security Council adopted UNSCR resolution 1284 and assessed by one or more members of the Sanctions Committee as containing item(s) on one or more of the UNSCR resolution 1051 lists. OIP will consider contracts in category A to be “returned to the submitting Mission or United Nations agency” and will notify the submitting Mission or United Nations agency accordingly, including national comments if possible. The submitting Mission or United Nations agency may submit a contract in category A as a new application under the GRL procedures. In category B will be all other contracts currently on hold. Contracts in category B will be recirculated by OIP under the GRL procedures. OIP will append the original committee registration number and national comments, for information purposes only, to any recirculated contracts. OIP should start this recirculation procedure within 60 days of adoption of this resolution and should complete the recirculation process within 60 days thereafter.

Expresses its firm conviction that the problems of opium poppy cultivation, illicit drug production and drug trafficking in and from Afghanistan can be solved by the efforts of the Afghan people with the support of the international community; 2. Welcomes the signature on 17 January 2002 by the Chairman of the Interim Administration of Afghanistan of a decree banning illicit crop cultivation and illicit drug production, processing, abuse and trafficking; 3. Welcomes the determination of the Interim Administration, in conscious fulfilment of its international obligations, to prevent the harvesting of the current opium poppy crop, and encourages the international community to assist in those efforts; 4. Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme to strengthen its capacity in Afghanistan in the key thematic areas of drug control— legal and judicial framework, law enforcement, enhancement of legal livelihoods, demand reduction and illicit crop monitoring—so that it can provide the necessary technical support, subject to the availability of voluntary resources, to the State High Commission for Drug Control of Afghanistan, the Interim Administration, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and others to mainstream drug control as a cross-cutting issue in reconstruction and development, giving priority to areas under opium poppy cultivation; 5. Encourages Member States and all relevant international organizations, in coordination with the Interim Administration, to provide immediate assistance to Afghan farmers and to contribute to the development of short-, medium- and long- term alternative livelihood strategies to replace opium poppy as a source of livelihood for farmers, building on the lessons learned from the pilot projects on alternative crops implemented by the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and in the context of wider development strategies for the alleviation of poverty; 6. Calls upon Member States to support effective programmes in Afghanistan that will address the current resurgence of opium poppy cultivation, establish an effective drug law enforcement capacity, create a legal framework in compliance with international agreements on illicit drugs, crime and terrorism, construct livelihood strategies offering alternatives to opium poppy cultivation and formulate programmes for the reduction of demand for illicit drugs; 7. Also calls upon Member States to assist the State High Commission for Drug Control, the Interim Administration and successor governing bodies in implementing the ban on opium poppy cultivation and drug production and trafficking and to commit themselves to the long-term goal of assisting Afghanistan in creating an economy that is not dependent on those illicit activities; 8. Further calls upon Member States to ensure that activities for the control of narcotic drugs are a cross-cutting issue that must be incorporated into the overall reconstruction and development strategy of Afghanistan; 9. Further calls upon Member States to support efforts to strengthen the “security belts” around Afghanistan in order to prevent trafficking in illicit drugs from Afghan territory and to prevent precursor chemicals from flowing into Afghanistan from or through its neighbouring countries; E/CN.7/2002/L.16/Rev.2 10. Calls upon all international organizations involved in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan to ensure that activities for the control of narcotic drugs are an integral part of their programmes; 11.

A global culture of cybersecurity will require that all participants address the following nine complementary principles: A/C.2/57/L.10/Rev.1 (a) Awareness. Participants should be aware of the need for security of information systems and networks and what they can do to enhance security; (b) Responsibility. Participants are responsible for the security of information systems and networks in a manner appropriate to their individual roles. They should review their own policies, practices, measures and procedures regularly, and should assess whether they are appropriate to their environment; (c) Response. Participants should act in a timely and cooperative manner to prevent, detect and respond to security incidents. They should share information about threats and vulnerabilities, as appropriate, and implement procedures for rapid and effective cooperation to prevent, detect and respond to security incidents. This may involve cross-border information sharing and cooperation; (d) Ethics. Given the pervasiveness of information systems and networks in modern societies, participants need to respect the legitimate interests of others and recognize that their action or inaction may harm others; (e) Democracy. Security should be implemented in a manner consistent with the values recognized by democratic societies, including the freedom to exchange thoughts and ideas, the free flow of information, the confidentiality of information and communication, the appropriate protection of personal information, openness and transparency; (f) Risk assessment. All participants should conduct periodic risk assessments that identify threats and vulnerabilities; are sufficiently broad-based to encompass key internal and external factors, such as technology, physical and human factors, policies and third-party services with security implications; allow determination of the acceptable level of risk; and assist in the selection of appropriate controls to manage the risk of potential harm to information systems and networks in the light of the nature and importance of the information to be protected; (g) Security design and implementation. Participants should incorporate security as an essential element in the planning and design, operation and use of information systems and networks; (h) Security management. Participants should adopt a comprehensive approach to security management based on risk assessment that is dynamic, encompassing all levels of participants’ activities and all aspects of their operations; (1) Reassessment. Participants should review and reassess the security of information systems and networks, and should make appropriate modifications to security policies, practices, measures and procedures that include addressing new and changing threats and vulnerabilities.",12/10/2002,2002_481001,Russian Federation,N/A,yes
