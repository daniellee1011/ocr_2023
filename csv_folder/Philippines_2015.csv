of international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by whomsoever committed, Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, including applicable international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, stressing in this regard the important role the United Nations plays in leading and coordinating this effort, Emphasizing that sanctions are an important tool under the Charter of the United Nations in the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security including countering terrorism, and underlining the importance of prompt and effective implementation of relevant resolutions, in particular Security Council resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) as key instruments in the fight against terrorism, Recalling its Resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011), 2161 (2014), 2170 (2014), and 2178 (2014) and its Presidential Statements of 28 July 2014 and 19 November 2014, including its stated intention to consider additional measures to disrupt oil trade by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Daesh), Al-Nusrah Front (ANF) and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, as a source of terrorism financing, 2 Y ~ >) s ba i) an Ss = — 15-01922 (E) 120215 A AM A A S/2015/100 Recognizing the importance of the role that financial sanctions play in disrupting ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and emphasizing also the need for a comprehensive approach to fully disrupt ISIL and ANF that integrates multilateral strategies with national action by Member States, Reaffirming the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, and reaffirming further the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming also that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, or civilization, Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and incapacitate the terrorist threat, Expressing, in this regard, its deep appreciation for Arab League Resolution 7804 (7 September 2014), the Paris Statement (15 September 2014), the FATF statement on countering the financing of ISIL (24 October 2014) and the Manama declaration on countering terrorist finance (9 November 2014), Reaffirming its resolution 1373 (2001) and in particular its decisions that all States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists, Recognizing the significant need to build capacities of Member States to counter terrorism and terrorist finance, Reiterating its deep concern that oilfields and their related infrastructure, as well as other infrastructure such as dams and power plants, controlled by ISIL, ANF and potentially other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, are generating a significant portion of the groups’ income, alongside extortion, private foreign donations, kidnap ransoms and stolen money from the territory they control, which support their recruitment efforts and strengthen their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, Condemning in the strongest terms abductions of women and children, expressing outrage at their exploitation and abuse, including rape, sexual abuse, forced marriage, committed by ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and encouraging all state and non-state actors with evidence to bring it to the attention of the Council, along with any information that human trafficking may support the perpetrators financially, Reaffirming the obligation of Member States to freeze without delay funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts; of entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons; and of persons and entities acting on behalf of, or at the direction of such persons and entities, including funds derived or generated from property owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons and associated persons and entities, 2/7 S/2015/100 Expressing its concern that economic resources such as oil, oil products, modular refineries and related material, other natural resources including precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper, diamonds, and any other assets are made available to ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and noting that direct or indirect trade with ISIL and ANF in such materials could constitute a violation of the obligations imposed by resolution 2161 (2014), Reminding all States of their obligation to ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice, Reaffirming its decision 2133 (2014) and noting again that ransom payments to terrorist groups are one of the sources of income which supports their recruitment efforts, strengthens their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, and incentivizes future incidents of kidnapping for ransom, Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists and their supporters, of new information and communications technologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate terrorist acts, as well as their use to incite, recruit, fund or plan terrorist acts, Expressing grave concern at the increased incidents of kidnapping and hostage-murdering committed by ISIL, and condemning those heinous and

Article 51 Protection of national security information This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security interests. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under other articles of this Statute. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance with this article. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or the Pre-Trial Judge or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative means. Such steps may include: (a) Modification or clarification of the request; (b) A determination by the Tribunal regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a source other than the requested State; (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor or the Tribunal of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a 15-12915 22/23 8/2015/562 specific description of the reasons would itself necessarily result in such prejudice to the State’s national security interests. Thereafter, if the Tribunal determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the guilt or innocence of the accused and the State denies the request for assistance in whole or in part, the Tribunal may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 52 Third-party information or documents If a State is requested by the Tribunal to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international organization, the State shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information.

The International Conference of Asian Political Parties (CAPP) was launched in Manila, the Philippines, in September 2000 to build bridges of political cooperation and to establish networks of mutual benefit among mainstream political parties in Asia, both ruling and in opposition. Over its first decade, ICAPP has grown steadily in both membership and influence. As of June 2015, ICAPP’s membership has reached more than 360 eligible political parties in 52 States and 1 territory in Asia. After establishing fraternal linkages and cooperation with the Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America and the Caribbean (COPPPAL) in 2008, ICAPP has also been undertaking efforts to reach out to the political parties in other continents, and successfully helped political parties in Africa establish the Council of African Political Parties (CAPP) in 2013. So far, ICAPP has held eight General Assemblies: in Manila (2000), Bangkok (2002), Beijing (2004), Seoul (2006), Astana (2009), Phnom Penh (2010), Baku (2012) and Colombo (2014). These Assemblies have brought together the Asian continent’s most prominent political leaders to search for ways of coexisting in a more peaceful, more democratic and more prosperous Asia. Its Standing Committee, made up of 35 leading political parties in 23 States, has met at least twice a year since 2004. Pare Please rec tees) 3 UNA . 15-14002 TT 260815 CAM AA A/70/194 ICAPP has also organized special conferences on key continental issues since 2008, such as those of minimizing political corruption (Seoul, 2008), strengthening state capacity (Kathmandu, 2009), easing mass poverty (Kunming, 2010), dealing with natural disasters (Kuala Lumpur, 2011), enhancing people’s access to benefits of development (Nanning, 2011), promoting green development (Xi’an, 2013), promoting women’s leadership (Seoul, 2013) and promoting regional economic cooperation (Vladivostok, 2015). From its inception, ICAPP has been a staunch supporter of the United Nations and its activities. The first paragraph of the preamble of the ICAPP Charter, adopted in September 2006, declares the unequivocal commitment of ICAPP to the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. Representatives of the political parties that took part in the 6th General Assembly of ICAPP, in Phnom Penh in 2010, unanimously adopted a declaration endorsing the bid for observer status for ICAPP in the United Nations General Assembly. ICAPP is also coordinating with the Governments of other United Nations Member States in joint initiatives towards the same objective. We believe that ICAPP can play a major role in forging cooperation between the United Nations and the political parties of Asia and those of Latin America and Africa in the future, the three continents of the emerging democracies, by aggregating and channelling to the United Nations system the views of the peoples in all their diversity, as expressed in political debates and discussions at all dimensions, local, national and continental, promoting people’s awareness, approval and support of international agreements reached at the United Nations, and building international consensus on United Nations action to meet key global challenges. In addition, ICAPP can provide support for political parties in the emerging democracies and increase their capacity to carry out at local and national levels their law-making and oversight functions on matters subject to international cooperation at the United Nations.",N/A,and a,"resolution regarding inviting ICAPP to participate in the sessions and work of the United Nations General Assembly (annex II).

Since its inception, ICAPP has grown steadily in both membership and influence. As of the end of June 2015, the membership of ICAPP has reached more than 360 eligible political parties in 52 States and 1 territory in Asia. So far, eight General Assemblies of ICAPP have been successfully held: in Manila in 2000, Bangkok in 2002, Beijing in 2004, Seoul in 2006, Astana in 2009, Phnom Penh in 2010, Baku in 2012 and Colombo in 2014, and they have brought together political leaders in the region to exchange opinions and communicate with each other and have helped strengthen unity among Asian States and propel Asia along the road towards stability and prosperity. The 9th ICAPP General Assembly will be held in Kuala Lumpur in September 2016. The ICAPP Standing Committee, made up of 35 leading political parties in 23 States, has met at least twice a year since 2004. ICAPP has also been annually organizing special conferences on key continental issues since May 2008, such as those of minimizing political corruption (Seoul, 2008), strengthening state capacity (Kathmandu, 2009), easing mass poverty (Kunming, 2010), dealing with natural disasters (Kuala Lumpur, 2011), enhancing people’s access to benefits of development (Nanning, 2011), promoting green development (Xi’an, 2013), promoting women’s leadership (Seoul, 2013) and promoting regional economic cooperation (Vladivostok, 2015). Another special conference, on rebuilding the Silk Road, will be held in Beijing in October 2015. Purpose Article 1 of the ICAPP Charter, adopted at the 4th General Assembly, in September 2006, stipulates the objectives of ICAPP as follows: (a) To promote exchanges and cooperation between political parties with various ideologies in Asia; (b) To enhance mutual understanding and trust among the peoples and countries in the region; (c) To promote regional cooperation through the unique role and channel of political parties; and (d) To create an environment for sustained peace and shared prosperity in the region. 4/11 A/70/194 Organizational structure Membership Article 2 of the ICAPP Charter stipulates that the ICAPP “shall be open to all political parties in Asia with democratically elected members in the parliaments of their respective countries, which are Member States of the United Nations”. It was agreed to extend an invitation to political parties in the Palestinian National Authority in an effort to render ICAPP activities more inclusive and representative of the diversities existing in the region, at the Sth Meeting of the Standing Committee, in June 2006. At the 8th Meeting of the Standing Committee, in November 2008, it was further agreed to apply two criteria to political parties in Asia to be eligible for invitation to future ICAPP activities: (1) political parties which have more than 1 per cent of elected seats in their parliaments, or (2) political parties which have won more than | per cent of popular votes in their latest parliamentary elections, as certified and recognized by their national election commissions. According to these criteria, there are more than 360 political parties in 52 States and | territory in Asia that are eligible to participate in ICAPP activities as of the end of June 2015. General Assembly According to Article 4 of the ICAPP Charter, a General Assembly is held once every two years on a rotational basis among its members, unless otherwise decided by the Standing Committee. And, in principle, the Assembly is held for three working days during the latter half of the year and is composed of an opening session, a plenary session and thematic committee meetings, special workshops on specific topics as approved by the Standing Committee and a closing session. Standing Committee According to Articles 9 and 10 of the ICAPP Charter, a Standing Committee, composed of the representatives of principal political parties of 23 countries in Asia, was established. The membership may be shared by up to two principal political parties from each country. Currently, the Standing Committee is composed of the representatives of the 35 leading political parties from 23 States representing different subregions of Asia, i.e. Central Asia, Northeast Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia and Oceania. The Members of the Standing Committee serve for two years from the end of a General Assembly until the end of the following General Assembly. The Standing Committee makes decisions and lays out the procedures on issues regarding the organization of ICAPP meetings, including the General Assemblies and special conferences, as well as other issues regarding other ICAPP activities and programmes. Since 2004, the Standing Committee has been meeting more than twice a year. Secretariat The Permanent Secretariat of ICAPP was established in Seoul, Republic of Korea, by a decision unanimously taken at the 10th Meeting of the Standing 5/11 A/70/194 Committee, in March 2009, and endorsed at the 5th General Assembly, in September 2009. In accordance with Article 12 of the ICAPP Charter, the Secretariat executes such functions, among others, as (1) to maintain and update the list of political parties and the official website, (2) to provide necessary information and assistance to ICAPP members, and (3) to establish contacts and promote cooperation with other international or regional organizations. Financing Article 8 of the ICAPP Charter stipulates that the political parties hosting the General Assembly, shall bear the primary expenses of the General Assemblies. The primary expenses include logistical arrangements for the General Assembly, i.e. conference facilities, domestic transportation, etc. The primary expenses shall not include, inter alia, international transportation to and from the location of the General Assembly. For the purposes of holding the General Assembly, the political parties hosting the General Assemblies, may seek voluntary contributions from members of ICAPP and other organizations. ICAPP activities, i.e. General Assemblies, Standing Committee Meetings and Special Conferences, are funded in principle by the political parties that host such events, which usually cover the costs of organizing conferences and minimum local accommodation for a limited number of representatives of political parties participating in the events. At the 10th Meeting of the Standing Committee, in March 2009, it was agreed that the budget and personnel to implement the functions of the ICAPP Secretariat shall be initially provided by the host country. It was further agreed that the Standing Committee will continue to discuss issues relating to budget and personnel of the Secretariat. Since 2010, the Korea Foundation in Seoul has provided funding to support a part of the Secretariat activities. Other administrative budget items, including office maintenance and personnel costs, are covered by private donations. Activities General Assemblies So far, eight ICAPP General Assemblies (GA) have been held. The Ist GA was held in Manila in September 2000 with representatives of 46 political parties from 26 countries, the 2nd GA in Bangkok in November 2002 with 77 parties from 35 countries, the 3rd GA in Beijing in September 2004 with 81 parties from 35 countries, the 4th GA in Seoul in September 2006 with 92 parties from 36 countries, the 5th GA in Astana in September 2009 with 63 parties from 33 countries, the 6th GA in Phnom Penh in December 2010 with 90 parties from 36 countries, the 7th GA in Baku in November 2012 with 60 parties from 30 countries, and the 8th GA in Colombo in September 2014 with 64 parties from 29 countries. These Assemblies have brought together the Asian continent’s most prominent political leaders to search for ways of coexisting in a more peaceful, more democratic and more prosperous Asia. 6/11 A/70/194 The 9th General Assembly is scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September 2016. Special conferences Special conferences and workshops have also been convened for ICAPP members on key challenges we are facing in the region, such as minimizing political corruption (Seoul, 2008), strengthening state capacity (Kathmandu, 2009), easing mass poverty (Kunming, 2010), dealing with natural disasters (Kuala Lumpur, 2011), enhancing people’s access to benefits of development (Nanning, 2011), promoting green development (Xi’an, 2013), promoting women’s leadership (Seoul, 2013) and promoting regional economic cooperation (Vladivostok, 2015). In addition, two separate workshops on human trafficking have been held in Kathmandu in January 2014 and in Phnom Penh in April 2015. ICAPP is preparing to host another special conference, on rebuilding the Silk Road and connecting the East and West, in Beijing in October 2015. Relations with other organizations Recently, ICAPP has been trying to reach out to other regions in the world. The first joint session was successfully held in Buenos Aires in July 2009 with COPPPAL, the Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America and the Caribbean. And, after establishing fraternal linkages and cooperation with COPPPAL, ICAPP has been undertaking efforts to reach out to the political parties in Africa, and successfully helped political parties in Africa establish the Council of African Political Parties (CAPP) in April 2013. In this regard, ICAPP is planning to convene the first trilateral meeting of representatives of ICAPP, COPPPAL and CAPP in Jakarta in April 2016. In addition, the ICAPP Standing Committee has recently decided to establish regular dialogue with various groups of political parties in Europe. ICAPP will continue to play a key role not only in Asia’s inevitable movement to build an Asian community, but also in the global quest for a more peaceful and prosperous world. Issues relating to the character of ICAPP Although ICAPP is not an intergovernmental organization per se, the following points with regard to its legal status should be well taken into consideration by the United Nations Member States: (a) ICAPP is unique in nature in that it is open to all political parties regardless of their political orientation; (b) The political parties participating in ICAPP activities are either responsible for forming the governments in their respective countries and making the most of their policies, or eligible to form future governments depending on the results of elections; (c) ICAPP has also been channelling to the United Nations system the results of their political debates at all levels, local, national and continental, like submitting the Kunming Declaration on Poverty Alleviation, which had been 7/11 A/70/194 adopted at the special ICAPP conference in Kunming in July 2010, in time for the United Nations Millennium Development Goals summit held two months later; (d) In addition, in recent years, ICAPP has been in close cooperation with political parties in other regions, i.e. Latin America and Africa, with a view to form a global forum of political parties, and, in the case of Latin America, ICAPP and COPPPAL have been holding annual joint sessions to coordinate their activities to promote United Nations objectives. Intergovernmental memorandum of understanding on cooperation to support ICAPP activities In recognition of ICAPP’s role in bringing together all political parties to promote understanding and friendship among countries not only in Asia but also in Latin America and Africa, Governments of several countries in the region concluded an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding (MOU) to provide support for the activities of ICAPP in July 2013. So far, the Governments of Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Vietnam have signed the MOU. Now, many more Governments, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Turkey, are in the process of completing their domestic procedures to sign the MOU. Reasons for seeking observer status for ICAPP From its inception, ICAPP has been a staunch supporter of the United Nations and its activities. The first paragraph of the preamble of the ICAPP Charter, adopted in September 2006, declares ICAPP’s unequivocal commitment to the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. Representatives of the political parties that took part in ICAPP’s 6th General Assembly, in Phnom Penh in December 2010, unanimously adopted a declaration that endorsed ICAPP’s bid for observer status in the United Nations General Assembly. ICAPP will play a key and continuing role not only in Asia’s inevitable movement to build an Asian community, but also in the global quest for a more peaceful and prosperous world. ICAPP can also play a major role in forging cooperation between the United Nations and the political parties not only of Asia but also of Latin America and Africa, the three continents of the emerging democracies, in the following areas: (a) Aggregating and channelling to the United Nations system the views of our peoples in all their diversity, as expressed in political debates and discussions at all dimensions, local, national and continental; (b) Promoting ordinary people’s awareness, approval and support of international agreements reached at the United Nations and through United Nations programmes; (c) Building international consensus on United Nations action to meet key global challenges; and (d) Providing support for political parties in the emerging democracies, to increase their capacity to carry out at local and national levels their law-making and 8/11 A/70/194 oversight functions on matters subject to international cooperation at the United Nations. In addition, the United Nations Secretary-General has been sending his video messages to all major programmes of ICAPP, including the opening sessions of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th General Assemblies of ICAPP, held in Astana, Phnom Penh, Baku and Colombo, and the ICAPP Special Conference on Poverty Alleviation, held in Kunming, and provided valuable contributions and guidance to the deliberations on the main themes of the conferences.

CMWI/C/GC/1. 3/11 Recognizing the increasing participation of women of all skill levels in international migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration, Recognizing also that the demand for migrant care work appears to be rising, where the failure to resolve care deficits and secure public provision of care has increased the demand for care work, particularly in the private sphere, and that some migrant workers engaged in informal care work, particularly women, face serious human rights abuses owing to the invisible nature of their workplace, while many benefit from the economic opportunities offered by care work, Recognizing the roles and responsibilities of and need for cooperation among all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, through targeted measures, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels, Recognizing also that women migrant workers have the potential to foster equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development through the economic and social impacts, as a result of their work, on countries of origin and destination, and underlining the value and dignity of their labour, including the labour of domestic and care workers, Recognizing further the particular vulnerability and needs of women and their children at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment and integration into the host society, as well as during their return to and reintegration in their countries of origin, Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, sexual violence, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts, discrimination, abusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work and contemporary forms of slavery, inter alia, all forms of forced labour and trafficking in persons, Recognizing that one of the key causes of labour exploitation that migrants, including women migrant workers, suffer is linked to the unscrupulous practices of some recruitment agencies and informal brokers which charge high recruitment fees, and noting with concern the reports of abuse committed by some recruitment agencies and employers, Recognizing also that the intersection of, inter alia, gender, age, class, race and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers and that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination, Reaffirming the commitment to respect, protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on 4/11 the Rights of Indigenous Peoples” to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate, Noting that the priority theme of the sixtieth session of the Commission on the Status of Women will be “Women’s empowerment and its link to sustainable development” and that migration can enable equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development for countries of origin and destination, migrants and their families, and in this regard recognizing the potential role of women migrant workers in contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Concerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, observing with concern that many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified and in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and inadequate social protection, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 12 June 2015, at its 104th session, of International Labour Organization Recommendation No. 204 on the transition from the informal to the formal economy, Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and _ broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender- sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of targeted policies and concrete strategies to specifically address violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse, Recognizing also that the vulnerabilities documented for women migrant workers highlight increasingly complex migration contexts and channels, where migrant workers may find themselves in life-threatening situations when entering other countries, Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote access to justice, such as the establishment of gender-sensitive protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings, Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and of the relevant special °° Resolution 61/295, annex. 5/11 procedures, as well as of the supervisory mechanisms of the International Labour Organization in monitoring
