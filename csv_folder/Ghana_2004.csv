Pursuant to Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations, the treaty was registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations. Membership ECOWAS is made up of the following 15 member States of West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo. Aims and purpose The creation of ECOWAS arose from the determination to accelerate the economic and social development of the States of West Africa through effective cooperation. To that end, ECOWAS has as its principal aim the integration of the national economies into an economic and monetary union. This involves the promotion of cooperation and development in all fields of economic activity, particularly agriculture, natural resources, commerce, monetary and financial questions, and social and cultural matters for the purpose of raising the standard of living of its peoples, increasing and maintaining economic stability, fostering closer relationship among its members and contributing to the progress and development of the African continent. Institutions of ECOWAS The work and activities of ECOWAS are carried out through the following structures: Authority of Heads of State and Government, Council of Ministers, Executive Secretariat, ECOWAS Parliament, ECOWAS Court of Justice, ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development, West African Health Organization, West African Monetary Agency, and technical and specialized commissions (covering all sectors and meeting at both the senior official and ministerial levels). Activities, achievements and cooperation with the United Nations The creation of an economic and monetary union has involved ECOWAS countries in various regional programmes aimed at market, monetary, physical, production and political integration. The market integration programme led to the establishment of West Africa as a free-trade area in January 2000, accompanied by a regional transit arrangement for goods; a common external tariff is to be introduced in January 2005 as the next step towards a customs union. Free movement of persons within the region has been achieved and member States have adopted common ECOWAS passports and travel certificates. A common currency is being created on a gradual basis through the establishment of a second monetary zone by July 2005, which is to be merged later with the existing CFA franc zone. A regional payments arrangement exists and an ECOWAS travellers cheque has been introduced. A/59/232 ECOWAS physical integration programmes have led to the development of a network of trans-West African highways and a regional system of telecommunication links. In the field of energy, a West African power pool is being created which involves the coordinated generation, transmission, distribution and marketing of power from conventional, new and renewable sources of energy. In the real sector, ECOWAS is promoting public/private partnerships to create a conducive business environment. This involves assistance to regional professional bodies of the organized private sector in organizing such events as regional trade fairs, industrial forums and buyer/seller meetings for promoting joint ventures and trans- border investments. ECOWAS has played a pioneering role in the developing world with the establishment of a mechanism for regional peace and security. The ECOWAS mediation and peacekeeping operations entity (ECOMOG) helped to resolve the civil conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and Cote d’Ivoire. A regional early-warning system and a high-level mediation organ form part of the ECOWAS conflict-prevention mechanism in operation in West Africa. Over the years, ECOWAS has developed very close working relations with the United Nations system. The active involvement of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) led to the creation of ECOWAS, and since then ECA has supported key programmes, including the rationalization of West African intergovernmental organizations. ECOWAS involves the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the International Trade Centre and the World Trade Organization in its trade development programmes. United Nations Industrial Development Organization assisted in the formulation of an ECOWAS regional industrial master plan and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is involved in the adoption of a common agricultural policy and a regional food security programme for West Africa. The International Telecommunication Union is an active partner in the modernization of the regional telecommunications system; similarly, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization are involved in the ECOWAS environment programmes. The World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund participate in the social and cultural cooperation programmes (health, education, culture, gender and child protection). The United Nations Development Programme (particularly its Regional Bureau for Africa) and the Security Council have been involved in the ECOWAS economic integration and regional security initiatives, respectively. Conclusion It is the hope of ECOWAS that its desire to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations is shared by all members of the General Assembly and that a decision will be taken at the fifty-ninth session inviting ECOWAS to participate in the session and work of the General Assembly in the capacity of observer.

E/CN.15/2004/L.7/Rev.1 Annex Guidelines on justice for child victims and witnesses of crime drawn up by the International Bureau of Children’s Rights™ A. OBJECTIVES AND PREAMBLE OBJECTIVES 1. The Guidelines on justice for child victims and witnesses of crime provide good practice based on the consensus of contemporary knowledge and relevant international and regional norms, standards and principles. They provide a practical framework to achieve the following objectives: (a) To guide professionals, and where appropriate volunteers, working with child victims and witnesses of crime in their day to day practice in the adult and juvenile justice process at the national, regional and international levels, consistent with the UN Declaration on Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power; (b) To assist in the review of national and domestic laws, procedures, and practices so that these ensure full respect for the rights of child victims and witnesses of crime and fully implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; (¢) To assist governments, international organizations, public agencies, non- governmental and community based organisations and other interested parties in designing and implementing legislation, policy, programmes and practices that address key issues related to child victims and witnesses of crime; (d) To assist and support those caring for children in dealing sensitively with child victims and witnesses of crime. Each jurisdiction will need to implement the Guidelines consistent with its legal, social, economic, cultural and geographical conditions. However, the jurisdiction should constantly endeavour to overcome practical difficulties in their application, as the Guidelines are, in their entirety, a set of minimum acceptable principles and standards. In implementing the Guidelines, each jurisdiction must ensure that adequate training, selection and procedures are put in place to meet the special needs of child victims and witnesses of crime, where the nature of the victimisation affects categories of children differently, such as sexual assault of girl children. These Guidelines cover a field in which knowledge and practice are growing and improving. They are neither intended to be exhaustive nor to preclude further development, provided it is in harmony with their underlying objectives and principles. E/CN.15/2004/L.7/Rev.1 The Guidelines should also be applied to processes in informal and customary systems of justice such as restorative justice and in non-criminal fields of law including, but not limited to, custody, divorce, adoption, child protection, mental health, citizenship, immigration and refugee law. CONSIDERATIONS The Guidelines were developed: (a) (b) (© (d) (e) ® (g (h) (i) Cognizant that millions of children throughout the world suffer harm as a result of crime and abuse of power and that the rights of these children have not been adequately recognized and that they may suffer additional hardship when assisting in the justice process; Reaffirming that every effort must be made to prevent victimization of children, particularly through implementation of the UN Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime; Recalling that the Convention on the Rights of the Child sets forth requirements and principles to secure effective recognition of the rights of children and that the Declaration on Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power sets forth principles to provide victims with the right to information, participation, protection, reparation and assistance; Stressing that all States Parties to international and regional instruments have a duty to fulfil their obligations, including the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Protocols; Recalling international and regional initiatives that implement the principles of the Declaration on Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, including the Handbook on Justice for Victims and the Guide for Policy Makers; Recognizing that children are vulnerable and require special protection appropriate to their age, level of maturity and individual special needs; Considering that improved responses to child victims and witnesses of crime can make children and their families more willing to disclose instances of victimization and more supportive of the justice process; Recalling that justice for child victims and witnesses of crime must be assured while safeguarding the rights of accused and convicted offenders, including those that focus on children in conflict with the law, such as the Beijing Rules; Bearing in mind the variety of legal systems and traditions and noting that crime has an increasingly trans-national nature and that there is a need to ensure child victims and witnesses of crime receive equivalent protection in all countries. PRINCIPLES In order to assure justice for child victims and witnesses of crime, professionals and others responsible for the well-being of these children must respect the following cross-cutting principles as stated in other international instruments and in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child as reflected in the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child: (a) (b) (c) (d) Dignity.

Every child should be treated as an individual with his or her individual needs, wishes and feelings. Professionals should not treat any child as a typical child of a given age, or as a typical victim or witness of a specific crime. Interference in the child’s private life should be limited to the minimum needed at the same time as high standards of evidence collection are maintained in order to ensure fair and equitable outcomes of the justice process. In order to avoid further hardship to the child, interviews, examinations and other forms of investigations should be conducted by trained professionals who proceed in a sensitive, respectful and thorough manner. All interactions described in these Guidelines should be conducted in a child-sensitive and empathetic manner in a suitable environment that accommodates the special needs of the child. They should also take place in a language that the child uses and understands. The right to be protected from discrimination (a) Child victims and witnesses should have access to the justice process that protects them from discrimination based on the child, parent, or legal guardian’s race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.

Professionals should be trained and educated about such differences. (© (d) In many cases, special services and protections will need to be instituted to take account of the different nature of particular offences against children, such as sexual assault involving girl children. Age should not be a barrier to a child’s right to participate fully in the justice process. Every child has the right to be treated as a capable witness, and his or her testimony should be presumed valid and credible at trial until proven otherwise and as long as his or her age and maturity allow the giving of intelligible testimony, with or without communication aids and other assistance.

The right to effective assistance (a) (b) (© (d) Child victims and witnesses and, where appropriate, family members should have access to assistance provided by professionals who have received relevant training as set out in subsection C-1 below. This includes assistance and support services such as financial, legal, counselling, health and social services, physical and psychological recovery services, and other services necessary for the child’s reintegration. All such assistance should address the child’s needs and enable them to effectively participate at all stages of the justice process. In assisting child victims and witnesses, professionals should make every effort to coordinate support so that the child is not subjected to excessive interventions. Child victims and witnesses should receive assistance from support persons, such as child victim/witness specialists, commencing at the initial report and continuing until these services are no longer required. Professionals should develop and implement measures to make it easier for children to give evidence and to improve communication and understanding at the pre-trial and trial stages. These measures may include: (i) Child victim/witness specialists to address the child’s special needs; (ii) Support persons, including specialists and appropriate family members to accompany the child during testimony; and (iii) Guardians ad litem to protect the child’s legal interests. The right to privacy (a) Child victims and witnesses should have their privacy protected as a matter of primary importance.

The child’s participation in hearings and trials should be planned ahead of time and every effort should be made to ensure continuity in the relationships between children and the professionals in contact with them throughout the process; Ensure speedy trials, unless delays are in the child’s best interest. Investigations of crimes involving child victims and witnesses should also be expedited, and there should be procedures, laws, or court rules that provide for cases involving child victims and witnesses to be expedited; Use child-sensitive procedures, including interview rooms designed for children, interdisciplinary services for child victims integrated under one roof, modified court environments that take child witnesses into consideration, recesses during a child’s testimony, hearings scheduled at times of day appropriate to the age and maturity of the child, an on-call system to ensure the child only goes to court when necessary, and other appropriate measures to facilitate the child’s testimony. Professionals should also implement measures to: (i) (i) Limit the number of interviews. Special procedures for collection of evidence from child victims and witnesses should be implemented in order to reduce the number of interviews, statements, hearings, and specifically, unnecessary contacts with the justice process, such as through use of pre-recorded videos; Avoid unnecessary contacts with the alleged perpetrator, his or her defence team and other persons not directly related to the justice process. Professionals should ensure that child victims and witnesses are protected, if compatible with the legal system and with due respect for the rights of the defence, from being cross- examined by their alleged perpetrator. Wherever possible, and as necessary, child victims and witnesses should be interviewed, and 10 (iii) examined in court, out of sight of the alleged perpetrator, and separate courthouse waiting rooms and private interview areas should be provided; Use testimonial aids to facilitate the child’s testimony. Judges should give serious consideration to permitting the use of testimonial aids to facilitate the child’s testimony and to reduce potential for intimidation of the child, as well as exercise supervision and take appropriate measures to ensure that child victims and witnesses are questioned in a child-sensitive manner. The right to safety (a) (b) (© Where the safety of a child victim or witness may be at risk, appropriate measures should be taken to require the reporting of these safety risks to appropriate authorities and to protect the child from such risk before, during and after the justice process. Child-focused facility staff, professionals, and other individuals who come into contact with children should be required to notify appropriate authorities if they suspect that a child victim or witness has been harmed, is being harmed, or where harm is likely to occur. Professionals should be trained in recognizing and preventing intimidation, threats and harm to child victims and witnesses. Where child victims and witnesses may be the subject of intimidation, threats or harm, appropriate conditions should be put in place to ensure the safety of the child. Such safeguards could include: (i) Avoiding direct contact between child victims and witnesses and their alleged perpetrators at any point in the justice process, (ii) Using court-ordered restraining orders supported by a registry system; (iii) Ordering pre-trial detention of the accused and setting special “no contact” bail conditions; (iv) Placing the accused under house arrest; and (v) Wherever possible, giving child victims and witnesses protection by police or other relevant agencies, and safeguarding their whereabouts from disclosure. The right to reparation (a) (b) Child victims and witnesses should, wherever possible, receive reparation in order to achieve full redress, reintegration and recovery. Procedures for obtaining and enforcing reparation should be readily accessible and child-sensitive. Provided the proceedings are child-sensitive and respect the Guidelines, combined criminal and reparations proceedings should be encouraged, together with informal and community justice procedures such as restorative justice. 11 (© Reparation may include restitution from the offender ordered in the criminal court, aid from state victims compensation programmes, and damages ordered to be paid in civil proceedings. Where possible, costs of social and educational reintegration, medical treatment, mental health care, and legal services should be addressed. Procedures should be instituted to ensure automatic enforcement of reparation orders and payment of reparation before fines. 10. The right to special preventive measures (a) In addition to preventive measures that should be in place for all children, (b) special strategies are required for child victims and witnesses who are particularly vulnerable to repeat victimization and/or offending. Professionals should develop and implement comprehensive and specially tailored strategies and interventions in cases where there are risks of further victimization to child victims. These strategies and interventions should take into account the nature of the victimization, including related to: abuse in the home, sexual exploitation, abuse in institutional settings, and trafficking. The strategies include those based on government, neighbourhood and citizen initiatives. C.

Professionals should cooperate on the implementation of these Guidelines so that child victims and witnesses are dealt with efficiently and effectively (a) (b) Professionals should make every effort to adopt an interdisciplinary approach in aiding children by familiarizing themselves with the wide array of available services, such as victim support, advocacy, economic assistance, counselling, health, legal, and social services. This approach may include protocols for the different stages of the justice process that encourage cooperation amongst agencies that provide services to child victims and witnesses, as well as other forms of multidisciplinary work that includes police, prosecutor, medical, social services, and psychological personnel working in the same location. International cooperation should be enhanced between States and all sectors of society, both at the national and international levels, including, mutual assistance for the purpose of facilitating collection and exchange of information and the detection, investigation and prosecution of trans- national crimes involving child victims and witnesses. The implementation of the Guidelines should be monitored (a) (b) Professionals should utilize these Guidelines as a basis for developing laws and written policies, standards and protocols aimed at assisting child victims and witnesses involved in the justice process.
