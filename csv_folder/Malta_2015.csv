of international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by whomsoever committed, Reaffirming the need to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, including applicable international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts, stressing in this regard the important role the United Nations plays in leading and coordinating this effort, Emphasizing that sanctions are an important tool under the Charter of the United Nations in the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security including countering terrorism, and underlining the importance of prompt and effective implementation of relevant resolutions, in particular Security Council resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) as key instruments in the fight against terrorism, Recalling its Resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011), 2161 (2014), 2170 (2014), and 2178 (2014) and its Presidential Statements of 28 July 2014 and 19 November 2014, including its stated intention to consider additional measures to disrupt oil trade by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as Daesh), Al-Nusrah Front (ANF) and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, as a source of terrorism financing, 2 Y ~ >) s ba i) an Ss = — 15-01922 (E) 120215 A AM A A S/2015/100 Recognizing the importance of the role that financial sanctions play in disrupting ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and emphasizing also the need for a comprehensive approach to fully disrupt ISIL and ANF that integrates multilateral strategies with national action by Member States, Reaffirming the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, and reaffirming further the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming also that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, or civilization, Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and incapacitate the terrorist threat, Expressing, in this regard, its deep appreciation for Arab League Resolution 7804 (7 September 2014), the Paris Statement (15 September 2014), the FATF statement on countering the financing of ISIL (24 October 2014) and the Manama declaration on countering terrorist finance (9 November 2014), Reaffirming its resolution 1373 (2001) and in particular its decisions that all States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists, Recognizing the significant need to build capacities of Member States to counter terrorism and terrorist finance, Reiterating its deep concern that oilfields and their related infrastructure, as well as other infrastructure such as dams and power plants, controlled by ISIL, ANF and potentially other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, are generating a significant portion of the groups’ income, alongside extortion, private foreign donations, kidnap ransoms and stolen money from the territory they control, which support their recruitment efforts and strengthen their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, Condemning in the strongest terms abductions of women and children, expressing outrage at their exploitation and abuse, including rape, sexual abuse, forced marriage, committed by ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and encouraging all state and non-state actors with evidence to bring it to the attention of the Council, along with any information that human trafficking may support the perpetrators financially, Reaffirming the obligation of Member States to freeze without delay funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts; of entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons; and of persons and entities acting on behalf of, or at the direction of such persons and entities, including funds derived or generated from property owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons and associated persons and entities, 2/7 S/2015/100 Expressing its concern that economic resources such as oil, oil products, modular refineries and related material, other natural resources including precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper, diamonds, and any other assets are made available to ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and noting that direct or indirect trade with ISIL and ANF in such materials could constitute a violation of the obligations imposed by resolution 2161 (2014), Reminding all States of their obligation to ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice, Reaffirming its decision 2133 (2014) and noting again that ransom payments to terrorist groups are one of the sources of income which supports their recruitment efforts, strengthens their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, and incentivizes future incidents of kidnapping for ransom, Expressing concern at the increased use, in a globalized society, by terrorists and their supporters, of new information and communications technologies, in particular the Internet, to facilitate terrorist acts, as well as their use to incite, recruit, fund or plan terrorist acts, Expressing grave concern at the increased incidents of kidnapping and hostage-murdering committed by ISIL, and condemning those heinous and

Reaffirms that all States shall ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice and ensure that such terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offenses in domestic laws and regulations and that the punishment duly reflects the seriousness of such terrorist acts, and emphasizes that such support may be provided through trade in oil and refined oil products, modular refineries and related material with ISIL, ANF and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida; 12.

"" B/C.12/2002/11. 2/6 as the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2015 update'* published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Welcoming also the fact that, according to Joint Monitoring Programme reports of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund, the Millennium Development target on safe drinking water was formally met, while being deeply concerned, however, that, according to the 2015 Joint Monitoring Programme update, 663 million people still lack access to improved drinking water sources and that eight out of ten people still without improved drinking water sources live in rural areas, Deeply concerned that the world missed the sanitation component of Millennium Goal 7 by almost 700 million people and that more than 2.4 billion people still do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, including more than 946 million people who still practise open defecation, which is one of the clearest manifestations of poverty and extreme poverty, Deeply concerned also that women and girls often face particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, such as education and leisure, or for women earning a livelihood, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, contributes to reinforcing the widespread stigma associated with menstruation, negatively affecting gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside of their homes or practising open defecation, Deeply alarmed that, every year, almost 700,000 children under 5 years of age die as a result of water and sanitation related diseases and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water availability, safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, as well as of inequality and discrimination in the access to safe drinking water and sanitation and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions, "" World Health Organization/United Nations Children’s Fund, Progress on Sanitation and Drinking Water, Geneva, 2015. 3/6 Deeply concerned also that inexistent or inadequate sanitation facilities as well as serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively affect water provision and the sustainable access to safe drinking water, and recognizing that, in progressively realizing the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the promotion and protection of all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Recalling the understanding by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation that the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are closely related, but have distinct features which warrant their separate treatment in order to address specific challenges in their implementation and that sanitation too often remains neglected, if not addressed as a separate right, while being a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, Recalling also that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and human dignity, Acknowledging the importance of equal access to safe drinking water and sanitation as an integral component of the realization of all human rights, 1. Affirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living are essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights; 2. Recognizes that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 3. Welcomes Goal 6 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which includes important dimensions related to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 4.

Calls upon non-State actors, including business enterprises, both transnational and others, to comply with their responsibility to respect human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, including by cooperating with State investigations into allegations of abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and by progressively engaging with States to detect and remedy abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 7. Invites regional and international organizations to complement efforts by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 8. Calls upon Member States to enhance global partnerships for sustainable development as a means to achieve and sustain the Goal and the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and highlights the need to develop adequate follow-up and review of progress on the agenda including on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all; 9. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and to endeavour to take steps, individually through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and _ technical cooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures; 10. Stresses the important role of the international cooperation and technical assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 11.
