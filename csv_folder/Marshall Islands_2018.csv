enforcement activities, Concerned that marine pollution from all sources constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, owing to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to its prevention and removal are necessary, including identification of such sources and environmentally sound techniques for its removal, Recognizing also that the majority of marine debris, including plastics and microplastics, entering the seas and oceans is considered to originate from land-based sources, Recognizing further that abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear, including ghost fishing gear, is an increasingly pervasive and destructive form of marine debris causing adverse impacts on fish stocks, marine life and the marine environment and that urgent preventative action is needed, such as marking of fishing gear as proposed by the Committee on Fisheries, as well as removal action, Noting that the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea focused its discussions at its nineteenth meeting, held from 18 to 22 June 2018, on anthropogenic underwater noise, ’

recognizing that, as indicated in The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2018, aquaculture is already making a significant contribution to the global seafood supply, and that a further increase in that contribution is anticipated, Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and nutrition and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture-producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, Noting in this regard the concern about the potential effects of genetically engineered aquatic fish species on the health and sustainability of wild fish stocks, Recognizing the efforts made by States and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements in regulating deep-sea fisheries, while still concerned that some deep-sea fishing activities in certain areas are being carried out without full implementation of relevant paragraphs of previous resolutions, representing a threat to vulnerable marine ecosystems, 6/41 Calling attention to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities whose livelihoods, economic development and food security are heavily dependent on sustainable fisheries and will suffer disproportionately if sustainable fisheries are negatively affected, Calling attention also to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries- and aquaculture-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to exercise their rights in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources and fulfil their obligations under international instruments, Noting the need to recognize and address the special role of women and the vulnerability of indigenous and local communities and minorities in small-scale fisheries, Recognizing the need to adopt, implement and enforce appropriate measures to minimize waste, by-catch and discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear and other
