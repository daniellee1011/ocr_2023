of water and sanitation within the three dimensions of sustainable development, Welcoming the holding of the General Assembly plenary meeting of 27 July 2011 entitled “The human right to water and sanitation”, Welcoming also the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of “Sanitation for All”, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Recalling general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), and the statement on the right to sanitation of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 November 2010, as well as the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that approximately 768 million people still lack access to improved drinking water sources and that more than 2.5 billion do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, including more than 1.04 billion people who still practice open defecation, as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2013 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, and that these figures do not fully capture the dimensions of water safety, the affordability of services and the safe management of excreta and wastewater, as well as equality, non-discrimination and differences between urban and rural areas, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Noting that the target of the Millennium Development Goals of halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was formally met five years ahead of schedule, and deeply concerned that the world remains off track to meet the sanitation component of the same target, which called for halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to an improved sanitation facility, that by 2015, if current trends continue, the world is set to miss the target by more than half a billion people, and that inexistent or inadequate sanitation facilities and serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can have a negative impact on water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world,
