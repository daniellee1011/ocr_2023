Expresses deep concern about the documented cases of civilians, including women and children, taken hostage by so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), calls for their immediate release and notes that hostage-taking and the murder of civilians may constitute a war crime, and condemns the recent reported mass arbitrary arrests and detention of civilians by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, and notes that imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of international law, when committed as part of a deliberate widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, may amount to a crime against humanity; 37.

Recalls the relevant reports of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism, in which it found that the Syrian authorities were responsible for the use of chemical weapons on four occasions, and that the Joint Investigative Mechanism also confirmed that so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh) was responsible for two chemical weapons attacks between 2014 and 2017; 39. Expresses grave concern at the findings by the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that sarin and chlorine were very likely used in separate attacks in Ltamenah on 24 and 25 March 2017, and that chlorine was likely used in an attack in Saraqib on 4 February 2018; 40.
