The objectives of the Forum include (1) to promote and deepen economic exchange, interaction and cooperation within Asia as well as between Asia and other parts of the world; and (2) to provide a high- level venue for dialogue among Governments, businesses, experts and scholars to discuss economic, social, environmental and other issues important for Asia and the world. On the proposal of Fidel V. Ramos, former President of the Philippines, Bob Hawke, former Prime Minister of Australia, and Morihiro Hosokawa, former Prime Minister of Japan, representatives of 25 countries met in Hainan Province, China, on 19 November 2000, and agreed that the Boao Forum for Asia would be established and its headquarters permanently located at Boao. On 27 February 2001, the Charter of the Boao Forum for Asia was unanimously adopted by the representatives of all the participating countries, and 26 countries including China became initial countries of the Forum. In 2006 and 2016, upon the requests of their Governments, the Forum accepted Israel, New Zealand and the Maldives as initial countries in addition to the original list. The Boao Forum for Asia consists of the General Meeting of Members, the Board of Directors, the Secretariat, the Research and Training Institute and the Council of Advisers. The General Meeting of Members is the ultimate authority of the Forum, and includes 234 political and business leaders, government agencies, companies and think tanks from 36 countries and regions around the world (as at 31 July 2019). The Board of Directors functions as the supreme executive body of the General Meeting. The 19 board members include former political leaders, business leaders and former heads of international organizations, who are nominated by Governments of relevant countries and approved by the General Meeting. The incumbent Chair of the Board of Directors is Mr. Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary- General of the United Nations. In accordance with the Charter of the Boao Forum for Asia and the laws of China, the host country, the Forum possesses full juridical personality and has full capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of immovable and movable property, and to institute legal proceedings. In 2005, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the Chinese Government and the Forum, which ensures for the Forum treatment as an intergovernmental international organization with regard to premises, tax concessions, entry and exit and the like. To help Asian countries to achieve common development and deepen economic cooperation with other regions, the Boao Forum for Asia holds its annual conference in Boao in the spring. State leaders, business elites and opinion leaders from various countries are invited to discuss key issues on the economic and social development of Asia and the world, such as finance, trade, investment and the environment. During the annual conference, consensus is reached, and regional and international initiatives are launched through exchanges on an equal footing. At the invitation of Governments, businesses and think tanks, the Boao Forum for Asia organizes conferences in various countries in Asia and beyond to forge partnerships between the public and private sectors and promote trade and investment facilitation. The Boao Forum for Asia works closely with the United Nations specialized agencies and major international economic organizations in co-hosting conferences 3/6 A/74/293 in specialized areas, conducting joint studies and releasing reports on regional and global economic trends. In 2019, the Forum signed a cooperation agreement with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat and held the Global Health Forum with the World Health Organization to advance their shared goals. We believe that the Boao Forum for Asia, which is based in Asia and with a global outlook, provides intellectual support for the sustainable development of the Asian economy and actively promotes economic globalization. It commits to safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at the core and to upholding a multilateral trading system that is open, transparent, inclusive, just and equitable. As an international public good and a platform for exchange of ideas, the Forum is jointly initiated and operated by Asian countries and receives support from around the world. Its activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations in the socioeconomic fields. We are convinced that granting the Boao Forum for Asia observer status in the General Assembly will help to facilitate deeper and long-term cooperation between the Forum and the United Nations. This will not only support the collaboration between the Asian countries in the pursuit of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, but also promote the robust, inclusive and sustainable growth of the world economy. 4/6 A/74/293 List of initial countries of the Boao Forum for Asia — er nN anw FF YN NO NY NY NY WN KN NY NY NO RO RR ee ee NAAR HN = SSH NDA BR wWN FS The Commonwealth of Australia The People’s Republic of Bangladesh Brunei Darussalam The Kingdom of Cambodia The People’s Republic of China The Republic of India The Republic of Indonesia The Islamic Republic of Iran The State of Israel Japan The Republic of Kazakhstan The Kyrgyz Republic The Lao People’s Democratic Republic The Republic of Maldives Malaysia Mongolia The Republic of the Union of Myanmar The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal New Zealand The Islamic Republic of Pakistan The Republic of the Philippines The Republic of Korea The Republic of Singapore The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka The Republic of Tajikistan The Kingdom of Thailand Turkmenistan The Republic of Uzbekistan The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 5/6 A/74/293 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the Boao Forum for Asia in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Noting the aspiration of the Boao Forum for Asia to develop its cooperation with the United Nations, 1.

also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the adverse impacts of climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level,

Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019: Safeguarding against Economic Slowdowns and Downturns, the number of hungry people in the world is growing, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries and 2 billion people in the world experience moderate or severe food insecurity; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8.

Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation 4 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 and A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.
