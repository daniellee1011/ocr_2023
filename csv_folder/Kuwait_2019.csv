created a safe haven and operating environment for crimes against humanity, Expressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of extremism and violent extremist groups, terrorists and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning all violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in

the Syrian regime’s infringement on the housing, land and property of Syrians, particularly through the dispossession of displaced Syrians’ land and property in the national legislation and similar measures, which would have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property and to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified
