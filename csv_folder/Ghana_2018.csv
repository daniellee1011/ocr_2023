achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, Noting that 1 billion people are directly impacted by remittances annually, either as senders or as recipients, and that 75 per cent of annual remittance

those from migrants, have across the Sustainable Development Goals and in supporting long- term development strategies, particularly on poverty reduction and access to basic services at the household

remittances, Recognizing also the role of the private sector in developing cost-effective and accessible money transfer services, including by linking them to other financial services for remittance

I, resolution 1, annex. ""| Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annexes | and II. ? Resolution 70/1. 2/9 Expressing concern that the pace of change is not sufficient to eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030 and that, in some countries and contexts, rates are rising and that, without further acceleration, an additional 150 million girls under 18 years of age will be married by 2030, Recognizing that, in many contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage can take the form of informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious or State authority and that constitute similarly harmful practices that violate, abuse or impair human rights and are linked to and perpetuate other harmful practices and human rights abuses, that these practices should be addressed in the context of the response to child, early and forced marriage and that these informal unions and other informal arrangements present particular challenges that would be alleviated by the identification of and the gathering of data on informal unions and marriage ceremonies without registration and require particular responses for the girls and women affected, Expressing deep concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, discriminatory laws, policies and norms, as well as ingrained social bias, impair the recognition, enjoyment and exercise of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women, children and adolescents, as well as the empowerment of all women and girls, and are also root causes of child, early and forced marriage, Recognizing that poverty, insecurity, early and/or unintended pregnancy and lack of education are also among the primary drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing also that, overall, harmful practices are themselves a form of violence against women and children and are often associated with serious forms of violence and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence from their partners, and that violence against women and girls is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, which reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines the autonomy and decision-making of women and girls in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, leadership and meaningful agency and participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of extreme poverty, Recognizing men and boys as strategic partners and allies alongside women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence and child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, 3/9 Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming discriminatory social norms and confronting gender inequalities, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further that addressing child, early and forced marriage includes supporting the specific needs of married girls, as well as women, affected by this practice and of their children, and underscoring the importance of removing the structural barriers that prevent access to justice, safe and quality education, counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services, childcare, employment and vocational training, and the provision of adolescent-friendly health services, protection services and alternatives for those who choose to leave marriage, Noting with concern that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education and that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, and that educational opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, and that the practice exposes girls and women to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations and early and/or unintended pregnancy, increases the risk of obstetric fistula, high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and complications during pregnancy and childbirth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health care and services for mothers, and noting with concern that it is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, Noting with deep concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage is highly exacerbated during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict and natural disaster because of various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, misconceptions regarding the provision of protection through marriage, the use of child, early and forced marriage as a tactic in conflict, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption of social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, Recognizing that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require 4/9 appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, including in humanitarian emergencies and settings, with attention paid to the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and sexual exploitation in those situations, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, 1. Calls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, teachers, religious, traditional and community leaders, civil society, human rights defenders, faith-based organizations, women’s, human rights and youth-led organizations and groups, humanitarian actors, the media and the private sector, to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive, integrated and coordinated responses and strategies to prevent, respond to and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, to support girls and women who are at risk, already married girls, married, divorced and widowed women who were married as girls, women and girls fleeing child, early and forced marriage, and women and girls in early and forced informal unions, including through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection mechanisms such as safe shelters, access to justice and the sharing of best practices across borders; 2. Also calls upon States to adequately and equitably resource national and subnational action plans to end child, early and forced marriage and to ensure that these efforts are included in budget allocation across health, nutrition, protection, governance, education and other relevant sectors and that there is transparency, accountability and public participation in the budgeting process; 3. Urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and ending child, early and forced marriage and protecting those at risk and, consistent with the fundamental principles of domestic law, to actively integrate these laws and policies into existing local or subnational legal frameworks and traditional legal systems, to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses and that women and girls have equality with men and boys in all matters pertaining to marriage, divorce, child custody and the economic consequences of marriage and its dissolution; 4. Also urges States to enact, uphold, enforce and effectively monitor the implementation of laws concerning a minimum age of marriage and to progressively amend laws so that lower minimum ages of marriage and/or ages of majority are raised to 18, and to engage all relevant authorities to ensure that these laws are well known, disseminated, popularized and understood; 5. Further urges States to repeal or amend relevant laws and remove any provision that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims; 6. Calls upon States to strengthen their efforts to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages, bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls; 5/9 7. Also calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of and active consultation with children and adolescents, especially girls, on all issues affecting them, and to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, both offline and online, that provide girls, including already married girls, and boys with information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, to be empowered, to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities; 8. Further calls upon States to promote education about the harmful effects of child, early and forced marriage on the individual and wider society and the benefits of ending the harmful practice, including through open dialogue with all stakeholders, including girls and boys, women and men, religious, traditional and community leaders, parents, legal guardians and other family members, to empower all women and girls to make decisions about their own lives, work with local communities to combat negative social norms and gender stereotypes that condone child, early and forced marriage, and empower parents and communities to abandon the practice; 9. Urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, to tackle poverty, including extreme poverty, lack of economic opportunities for women and girls, and entrenched economic incentives, as drivers of child, early and forced marriage, including by ensuring the rights of women and girls to inheritance and property, their equal access with men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, to encourage girls to continue their education, to develop livelihood opportunities through access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills education, including financial literacy, and to promote the equal access of women to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as their equal political participation and rights to move freely at their own discretion and to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; 10. Urges States to ensure that the specific needs and human rights of already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice are addressed through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, increase their decision-making power, make it easier for them to seek formal employment, increase their economic independence and financial literacy, enable them to gain access to education and lifelong training opportunities, ensure their equal access to health-care services and information and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change harmful gender norms; 11. Calls upon States to invest in quality education for every child in a safe environment, including through adequate financing, as well as to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free, quality and continuous primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school, including because of marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, which empowers young women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education that is relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality and the 6/9 empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-service providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 12. Urges States to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by removing barriers to education, including by ensuring that married girls and boys, pregnant girls and women and young parents continue to have access to schooling, improving access to quality formal education and skills development, especially for those living in remote or insecure areas, improving the safety of girls at and on the way to and from school, providing safe and adequate sanitation, including for menstrual hygiene management, and adopting laws and policies to prohibit, prevent and address school-related sexual and gender-based violence, and to hold perpetrators accountable, recognizing that education is one of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to help married women and girls make informed decisions about their lives; 13. Also urges States to intensify efforts to prevent and eliminate violence and sexual harassment against girls at and on the way to school by, inter alia, implementing effective activities in schools and communities to prevent and respond to violence, engaging men and boys, educating children from a young age regarding their human rights and the importance of treating all people with dignity and respect and by designing educational programmes and teaching materials that support gender equality, respectful relationships and non-violent behaviours; 14. Encourages States to adopt, as appropriate, and implement inclusive policies and programmes to promote technical and vocational training and skills development for women and girls, including those at risk of or survivors of child, early and forced marriage, so as to enable them to gain the knowledge, attitudes and skills that they need to fulfil their full potential; 15. Urges Governments to promote, respect and protect the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health through the development and enforcement of policies and legal frameworks and the strengthening of health systems, including health information systems, that make universally accessible and available quality, gender-responsive, adolescent-friendly health services, sexual and reproductive health-care services, information and commodities, HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, treatment and care, mental health services and nutrition interventions and prevention, treatment of and care for obstetric fistula and other obstetric complications by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care; 16.

Urges States to formulate or review, as needed, comprehensive, multidisciplinary and coordinated national and subnational plans, programmes or 7/19 strategies to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, that strengthen child protection systems, have dedicated resources, are widely disseminated and provide targets and timetables for implementation, as well as effective domestic enforcement procedures through the establishment of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms involving all parties concerned, including consultations with women’s and girls’ organizations; 18.

harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Noting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of education are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic independence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, and further recognizing that the economic autonomy of women can expand their options for leaving abusive relationships, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty, and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls, Recognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and confronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, with the active support and engagement of 3/9 their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the importance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that respond to their specific needs, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision- making, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, 1. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;!” 2. Calls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, 4/9 teachers, religious, traditional and community leaders, civil society, organizations led by girls, women’s organizations, youth and human rights groups, the media and the private sector, to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive and coordinated responses and strategies to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, to support girls and women who are affected or at risk, who have fled such a marriage or whose marriage has dissolved, and widowed girls or women who were married as girls, including through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection mechanisms such as safe shelters, access to justice and the sharing of best practices across borders; 3. Also calls upon States to develop and implement measures at all levels to end child, early and forced marriage, including national and subnational action plans where appropriate, and to make adequate resources available across relevant sectors, including health, nutrition, protection, governance and education; 4. Urges States to enact, enforce and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage, protecting those at risk and addressing the needs of those affected, and work towards the coherence of these laws and policies at the local level, to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses; 5. Calls upon States to enact, enforce and uphold laws concerning a minimum age of marriage, to monitor their application and to progressively amend laws with lower minimum ages of marriage and/or ages of majority to 18 and engage all relevant authorities to ensure that these laws are well known; 6. Urges States to repeal or amend laws and remove any provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse or abduction to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims; 7. Calls upon States to strengthen their efforts to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages; 8. Also calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of and active consultation with children and adolescents, including already married girls, on all issues affecting them, and to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, including in digital spaces, that provide information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, and lifelong learning opportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare as needed, to be empowered, to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities; 9. Further calls upon States to promote awareness-raising about the harmful effects of child, early and forced marriage on the individual and wider society and the benefits of ending this harmful practice, including through open dialogue with all stakeholders, including girls and boys, women and men, religious, traditional and community leaders, parents, legal guardians and other family members, to work with local communities to combat negative social norms and gender stereotypes that condone child, early and forced marriage, to empower parents and communities to abandon the practice and to empower all women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives; 10. Recognizes that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding and that parents or, as the case may be, legal 5/9 guardians have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child, acknowledging the need to support their capacity to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, and reaffirming that the best interests of the child will be their basic concern; 11. Urges Governments, while addressing child, early and forced marriage, to confront family poverty and social exclusion through investing in family-oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 12.
