31/8 of 23 March 2016, 34/20 of 24 March 2017 and 37/8 of 22 March 2018, Reiterating that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and

environment for human rights defenders, Reaffirming also the importance of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and its full and effective implementation, and that promoting respect, support and protection for the activities of human rights defenders, including women and indigenous human rights defenders, is essential to the overall enjoyment of human rights and for the protection and conservation of the environment, including the rights to life, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food and housing, and to safe drinking water and sanitation, and cultural rights, Recognizing the positive, important and legitimate role played by human rights defenders in the promotion and

consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, and that the specific nature of indigenous peoples and rural and local communities can aggravate their vulnerability, as they can be located in isolated areas without communication access or network support, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples are among the first A/HRC/40/L.22/Rev.1 to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Taking note of the report of the

Expresses grave concern at the findings by the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that sarin and chlorine were very likely used in separate attacks in Ltamenah on 24 and 25 March 2017, and that chlorine was likely used in an attack in Saraqib on 4 February 2018; 40. Also expresses grave concern that, according to the Commission of Inquiry, a vast body of evidence suggested that chlorine had been dropped by helicopter on a residential building and it had received information on the death of at least 49 individuals and the wounding of up to 650 others in Duma on7 April 2018, and at the findings of the Commission in the same report that, in a series of ground attacks in Duma on 22 January and | February 2018, the Syrian authorities and/or affiliated militias had committed the war crime of using prohibited weapons, following a pattern previously documented by the Commission concerning the use of chemical weapons; 41. Further expresses grave concern at the findings of the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its report of 1 March 2019 that, on the basis of its evaluation and analysis of all the information gathered, there are reasonable grounds that a toxic chemical was used as a weapon in Duma on 7 April 2018, and that the toxic chemical was likely molecular chlorine; 42. Expresses grave concern at the reports of the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of July 2016, March 2017, July 2017, October 2017, March 2018, July 2018, October 2018 and March 2019, in which it continues to report that it is unable to verify that the declaration made by the Syrian authorities regarding their chemical weapons programme was accurate and complete in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, and calls upon the Syrian Arab Republic to cooperate fully with the Organisation to provide further clarification relating to the gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies that remain concerning the declaration, to issue the necessary visas to members of the Investigation and Identification Team, and to grant it all required access and authorizations; 43. Demands that all parties desist immediately from any use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, expresses its strong conviction that those responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held accountable and expresses its support in this regard for the objectives and commitments of the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons to support accountability for all those responsible for the proliferation or use of chemical weapons; 44. Reaffirms the importance of establishing appropriate processes and mechanisms to achieve justice, reconciliation, truth and accountability for gross violations and abuses of international law, and reparations and effective remedies for victims, in particular victims of sexual and gender based violence, detainees, internally displaced persons and disappeared persons, and stresses the prerequisite role that accountability can play in any efforts to bring about a sustainable, inclusive and peaceful conclusion to the conflict; A/HRC/41/L.25 45. Recalls that the International Criminal Court was established to help to end impunity for applicable crimes in which a State is unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out investigations or prosecutions; 46. Emphasizes the need to ensure that all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of international human rights law are held to account through appropriate, fair and independent national, regional or international criminal justice mechanisms, and stresses the need to pursue practical steps towards this goal, while noting the important role that the International Criminal Court can play in this regard, and noting the authority of the Security Council to refer such situations to the Court; 47. | Welcomes the work of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, as mandated by the General Assembly in resolution 71/248 of 21 December 2016, including its close cooperation with the Commission of Inquiry and Syrian civil society, so that the voices of victims are heard, any evidence of crimes is collected and criminal prosecution proceeds; 48. Invites Member States to actively support the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism, including by considering the provision of information and data on the most serious crimes under international law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to provide adequate financial means for its functioning, pending a decision on the necessary funding of the Mechanism by the regular budget, in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions, highlights the importance of sustainable funding, and notes the steps taken by the Secretary-General in this respect; 49. Welcomes the steps taken by Member States to prosecute the most serious crimes under international law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic in national courts under the principles of universal jurisdiction and extraterritorial jurisdiction as an important contribution to end impunity and ensure justice for victims, and notes the contribution that the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism and other accountability mechanisms can make in this regard; 50. Deplores the grave humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic and expresses deep concern at the plight of the 11.7 million people in need of full, timely, immediate, unhindered and safe humanitarian assistance, including the over 5 million Syrians whose needs are particularly acute and the over 1 million people who remain in hard-to-reach areas, where freedom of movement and access to humanitarian aid and services remain very restricted; 51. Strongly condemns the Syrian authorities’ continued and deliberate obstruction of life-saving humanitarian assistance to those most in need, including the removal of humanitarian aid from United Nations-approved convoys, including medical aid and supplies intended to reach desperate populations deprived of food, medical aid and vital necessities, which may result in the starvation of civilians; 52. | Expresses deep concern at the deliberate use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, and encourages the Commission of Inquiry to include in future investigations violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law related to the use of starvation of civilians; 53. Deplores the escalation of violence in the north-west of the country, and strongly condemns the attacks by the Syrian authorities and their State and non-State allies on civilians and first responders and civilian infrastructure, including medical facilities, which is causing immense suffering to the civilian population, with over 300,000 people forced to leave their homes since April 2019, in addition to the almost 2 million displaced from homes at least once, and which has caused the death of almost 500 civilians and damage to at least 37 schools and 25 health facilities; 54. | Demands that the Syrian authorities facilitate, and all other parties to the conflict do not hinder, the full, timely, immediate and safe access of the United Nations and other humanitarian actors, and that they ensure that the delivery of unrestricted humanitarian aid reaches all those in need, for as long as it is needed, including in hard-to-reach areas, in A/HRC/41/L.25 accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions, and calls upon Member States to fully fund the United Nations appeals; 55. Expresses deep concern for the more than 5.6 million registered refugees in the region fleeing the violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, welcomes the efforts of the neighbouring countries, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, as well as of Egypt, to host Syrian refugees, acknowledges the socioeconomic consequences of the presence of large-scale refugee populations in those countries and urges the international community to provide urgent financial support to enable the host countries to respond to the growing humanitarian needs of Syrian refugees, including the particular needs of women, girls, and persons with disabilities, while emphasizing the principles of responsibility and burden-sharing; 56. Notes those States outside the region that have put in place measures and policies to assist and to host Syrian refugees, encourages them to do more, and also encourages other States outside the region to consider implementing similar measures and policies, also with a view to providing Syrian refugees with protection and humanitarian assistance; 57. Welcomes the relevant international conferences on supporting the Syrian people, notably the third conference entitled “Supporting the future of Syria and the region” hosted by the European Union and co-chaired by the United Nations in Brussels in March 2019, where more than $7 billion was pledged, and renews its call for the international community to deliver in full all such pledges; 58. Reaffirms that there can only be a political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, demands that all parties work towards a genuine political transition based on the Geneva communiqué and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), within the framework of the United Nations-led intra-Syrian talks in Geneva and with the equal voice and full and meaningful leadership and participation of women in decision-making and in all efforts consistent with Council resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on women, peace and security, that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for a civil, democratic and pluralistic State, in which all citizens receive equal protection, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion or belief, and welcomes the inclusion of civil society in this process; 59.

GE.19-11624(E) 911624* Please recycle eS A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 Welcoming the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on child, early and forced marriage in humanitarian settings,’ and the report of the Secretary-General on child, early and forced marriage,” Welcoming also the United Nations Population Fund-United Nations Children’s Fund Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage, and other ongoing United Nations activities and programmes on child, early and forced marriage, noting regional, national and subnational instruments, mechanisms and initiatives to end child, early and forced marriage, including the African Union Campaign to End Child Marriage, the Model Law on Eradicating Child Marriage and Protecting Children Already in Marriage developed by the Southern African Development Community, the Regional Action Plan to End Child Marriage in South Asia (2015-2018), the Kathmandu Call for Action to End Child Marriage in South Asia, the Kigali Declaration adopted by national human rights institutions from Commonwealth countries, the Joint Inter-Agency Programme to End Child Marriage and Early Unions in Latin America and the Caribbean, and further encouraging coordinated approaches to action at all levels, Welcoming further the recent progress made globally towards ending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease in the proportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the past decade from one in four to approximately one in five, while expressing concern that, despite this global trend, progress has been uneven across regions and that the current pace of change is not sufficient to fulfil the commitment under target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, Expressing concern that in some countries and contexts, rates of child, early and forced marriage are rising, and that every year at least 12 million girls are still married before they reach the age of 18, Recognizing that, while child, early and forced marriage primarily has an impact on women and girls, boys and men can also be subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and expressing concern that an estimated 1 in 30 boys marry before they reach the age of 18, Recognizing also that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Recognizing further that addressing child, early and forced marriage requires a holistic human rights-based approach, with interventions focused on preventing and ending harmful practices, and on changing social norms and attitudes that underlie the practices, and with special attention paid to and the meaningful involvement of those who have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage, Noting with concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage is highly exacerbated in humanitarian settings by various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, the use of forced marriage as a tactic in conflict, lack of access to education, the stigma of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruptions in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates, abuses and impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls and harmful practices, including female genital mutilation, and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, 1 A/ARC/41/19. 2 A/73/257. A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal values, discriminatory gender norms, stereotypes, perceptions and customs that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, and deeply concerned also that poverty, insecurity, lack of access to education and health services, and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of this harmful practice, and that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, play an essential role in changing negative social norms and confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations and feminist groups, Recognizing also the need to support girls and women who are subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and recognizing further the importance of ensuring the autonomy of these women and girls and their access to social services, counselling, shelter, education, lifelong learning and vocational training, to formal employment and economic independence for women and economic empowerment for girls , to adequate health services, information and education, including for sexual and reproductive health, mental health, psychosocial support and rehabilitation services, to nutrition, housing, clean water, sanitation and hygiene, and to justice, legal services and services that protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, and recognizing that such provisions are all necessary for the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and intimate partner violence, Deeply concerned that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma related to menstruation, and social norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities is one of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities, and the active participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives, and remains an impediment not only to the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development of society as a whole, and that investing in the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, as well as strengthening their voice, agency, leadership and full, effective and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty, and are critical for, inter alia, sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women, to enter and advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 and the investment in women’s and girls’ development is a priority in and of itself, has a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing further that women and girls generally share the experience of being worse off economically than men and boys, and that often women and girls experience significantly higher declines in income and increased dependence on social welfare and other informal assistance, after dissolution of marriage, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and _ possible retribution, Recognizing that the criminalization of child, early and forced marriage alone is insufficient when introduced without complementary measures and support programmes, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of and the loss of livelihoods for the families affected, and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of informal unions or unregistered marriages, Recognizing also that everyone, including men and boys, benefits from the achievement of gender equality and that the impacts of gender inequality, discrimination and violence against women and girls, including child, early and forced marriage, are borne by society as a whole, and emphasizing, therefore, that men and boys, by taking responsibility themselves and working jointly in partnership with women and girls at all levels, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and ending this practice, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-responsive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable, disaggregated data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Recognizing that the registration of births, marriages, divorces and deaths is part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve sustainable development, and that the absence of compulsory registration of customary and religious marriages is a major impediment to the implementation of existing legislation and other initiatives to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, 1. Recognizes that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, and that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, and that every girl and woman at risk of or affected by these practices must have equal access to quality education, counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services and medical care; 2. Urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution and to address their specific needs, such as through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender- A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 based violence, including domestic and intimate-partner violence, increase their decision- making power and financial literacy, make it easier for women to seek formal employment and increase their economic independence, improve women’s and girls’ access to education, skills development programmes, vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities, ensure their equal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 3. Also urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, protecting those at risk, including in humanitarian settings, and supporting women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses and that women have equality with men in all matters pertaining to marriage, divorce, child custody and the economic consequences of marriage and its dissolution; 4. Further urges States to remove any provisions that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims, in particular by repealing or amending such laws; 5. Calls upon States to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages; 6.

peace and security, the Commission on the Status of Women and other United Nations agencies and bodies that consider the issue of discrimination against women and girls, Underscoring the fact that international human rights law prohibits discrimination, inter alia on the basis of gender, and that national legislation, policies and practices should adhere to each State’s international obligations, Expressing profound concern at the backlash against progress made by States, international and regional organizations and civil society, including women’s and community-based organizations, feminist groups, women human rights defenders, trade unions and girls’ and youth-led organizations, to respect, protect and fulfil all human rights, and recognizing that these retrogressions can be linked to economic crisis and inequality, retrogressive lobbies, political views or misuse of religion to oppose the struggle for women’s and girls’ equal rights, Recognizing that the right to liberty is a human right recognized in international instruments and that it is inextricably linked to other rights, including the rights to freedom of movement, the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, sexual and reproductive health, work, education, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, freedom of expression, freedom of religion or belief, equality, freedom from discrimination, and privacy, with full respect for the dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy of the person, Recognizing also the differing needs of girls and women at different ages and stages of their lives, and the various forms of discrimination, in particular multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, that affect their day-to-day reality and that can lead to

norms, perceptions, customs and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage, have direct negative implications for the status and treatment of women and girls and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Reaffirming that the full enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls includes their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexuality, sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy and agency of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, in accordance with applicable international human rights standards, Recognizing the major contributions made by civil society, including women’s organizations, feminist groups, women human rights defenders, trade

inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the implementation of measures promoting substantive gender equality in the empowerment of women and girls in all spheres, Regretting that women remain underrepresented, especially in management positions, in several United Nations bodies and mechanisms responsible for developing international human rights norms and standards and monitoring their implementation, and noting that balanced gender representation is an essential step towards bringing about a structural change needed to advance substantive gender equality and gender parity in line with the system-wide strategy on gender parity, while bearing in mind the necessity to A/HRC/41/L.6/Rev.1 secure the highest standard of efficiency, competence and integrity, as well as

Declares that: (a) The global threat posed by nuclear weapons must urgently be eliminated; (b) Discussions, decisions and actions on nuclear weapons must focus on the effects of these weapons on human beings and the environment and must be guided by the unspeakable suffering and unacceptable harm that they cause; (c) Greater attention must be given to the impact of a nuclear weapon detonation on women and the importance of their participation in discussions, decisions and actions on nuclear weapons; (d) Nuclear weapons serve to undermine collective security, heighten the risk of nuclear catastrophe, aggravate international tension and make conflict more dangerous; (e) Arguments in favour of the retention of nuclear weapons have a negative impact on the credibility of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime; (f) The long-term plans for the modernization of nuclear weapons arsenals run contrary to commitments and obligations to nuclear disarmament and engender perceptions of the indefinite possession of these weapons; (g) In a world where basic human needs have not yet been met, the vast resources allocated to the modernization of nuclear weapons arsenals could instead be redirected to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals; !° (h) Given the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons, it is inconceivable that any use of nuclear weapons, irrespective of the cause, would be compatible with the requirements of international humanitarian law or international law, or the laws of morality, or the dictates of public conscience; (i) Given their indiscriminate nature and potential to annihilate humanity, nuclear weapons are inherently immoral; 4. Notes that all responsible States have a solemn duty to take decisions that serve to protect their people and each other from the ravages of a nuclear weapon detonation, and that the only way for States to do so is through the total elimination of nuclear weapons; 5.
