in particular the adoption of legislative measures, Expressing deep concern about the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the right to education for all, taking into account that more than 1.5 billion learners have been affected by the closure of educational institutions worldwide, Expressing concern also that, despite the tremendous efforts made by States and other stakeholders, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected those in the most vulnerable and marginalized situations, including in particular girls and women, persons with disabilities,

limited to those based on gender, age, disability and migration or refugee status, and with their negative impact on the realization of the right to education, Stressing in this respect that the incorporation of digital technologies in education, notwithstanding its potential to expand and complement access to education, is not a long- term replacement for on-site schooling, and the need for a thorough debate on the role of digital technologies in education, keeping in mind not only equality of opportunities, including for conflict-affected areas, but also its potential unintended negative effects, including on children’s and young persons’ health, education and interpersonal development, the changes it may create in the organization of education systems and the potential to

convinced that this should guide the design and deployment of United Nations peace operations, and understanding United Nations peace operations as peacekeeping operations and special political missions, Recognising the crucial role peacekeeping plays in creating conditions for stability and lasting peace, and the need for United Nations peace operations to have integrated strategies that articulate a clear pathway to transition and to achieving sustainable peace, and wunderlining that transitions of United Nations Peace Operations are understood as a strategic process which builds towards a reconfiguration of the strategy, footprint, and capacity of the United Nations in a way that supports peacebuilding objectives and the development of a sustainable peace, in a manner that supports and reinforces national ownership, informed by the operational context and the national priorities and needs of the host State and its population, and that includes engagement with local community and civil society, and, where relevant, regional and sub-regional organisations, and other relevant stakeholders, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and the inclusion of youth and persons with disabilities, Reiterating the primary responsibility of States to protect the population throughout their territories, recognising that reconfigurations of missions may entail increased risks for civilians, in particular for women, youth, children, persons with disabilities, and, where relevant, the need to enhance States’ capacity to protect their own civilians,

extension of legitimate State authority in ensuring the protection of civilians over the longer term and in the consolidation of peace and stability, taking note of interlinkages between transitional

sequenced, mandated tasks and, where appropriate, a clear prioritisation of tasks to achieve this outcome, reflecting the need to create favourable conditions for sustainable peace, understanding prioritisation as the mission focussing on those specific mandated tasks which are based on up-to-date conflict analysis and planning and are assessed as responding to the evolving needs on the ground, and further understanding sequencing as a logical, flexible implementation of the mandate over time, in line with the strategic vision as set out 2/6 S/2021/771 in the mandate, aligned with the peace and security needs within the host State, building towards a consolidation of peace, Recognising that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is the responsibility of all

political solutions, strengthening protection of civilians, improving the safety and security of peacekeepers, implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda, supporting effective performance and accountability, improving peacekeeping partnerships, strengthening the conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel, and strengthening the impact of peacekeeping on peacebuilding and sustaining peace, Reaffirming that “sustaining peace” should be broadly understood as a goal and a process to build a common vision of a society, ensuring that the needs and human rights of all segments of the population are taken into account, which encompasses activities, including promotion of justice and accountability, aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, addressing root causes, assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction and development, and emphasising that
