That war, unprecedented in its scale and ferocity, turned into a great tragedy for the peoples of Europe, Asia and the world. A threat to the very basic principles of civilization was averted at the cost of colossal joint efforts and grave losses. Through the suffering and death of millions of people, the world community came to realize the indispensability of a system of collective security and the necessity of establishing reliable machinery to ensure international peace. The burning desire to spare humanity forever from the miseries of war inspired States to establish a reliable mechanism for maintaining international peace and security — the United Nations. The objectives set for the Organization when established are still relevant. Among them are the strengthening of an equitable world order based on the principles of humanism and mutually beneficial cooperation, the effective maintenance of international peace and security, and the promotion of sustained development in the political, socioeconomic and other spheres. Today we need to remember the lessons of the Second World War and to work to promote the preservation of the historical memory of peoples. The perception of the victory won in 1945 as a common value for all of humanity is essential for the coming together of the international community to address dangerous modern challenges and threats. The memory of the victory over fascism is also relevant in terms of preventing attempts to revise the results of the Second World War and the conclusions of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as well as in the light of the objectives of the United Nations to oppose crimes based on race, nationality and ethnic origin and the spread of ideas of intolerance and related contemporary forms of racial discrimination. It is in the direct interest of humanity to further strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as the central element in the collective security system designed to put into practice the high goal proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations — “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Consideration of this agenda item could lead to the adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Second World War. This would make it possible to hold a special solemn meeting of the General Assembly in memory of all victims of the war. 3/4 A/74/290 Annex IT Draft resolution Seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 59/26 of 22 November 2004, in which it, inter alia, declared 8 and 9 May as a time of remembrance and reconciliation, while recognizing that Member States may have individual dates of victory, liberation and commemoration, Recalling that 2020 will mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a war which brought untold sorrow to mankind, particularly in Asia and Europe, Stressing that this historic event established the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, Calling upon the States Members of the United Nations to unite their efforts in dealing with new challenges and threats, with the United Nations playing a central role, and to make every effort to settle all disputes by peaceful means in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered, Underlining the progress made since the end of the Second World War in overcoming its legacy and towards reconciliation, international and regional cooperation and the promotion of democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular through the United Nations, and the establishment of regional organizations and other appropriate frameworks, 1.

The objectives of the Forum include (1) to promote and deepen economic exchange, interaction and cooperation within Asia as well as between Asia and other parts of the world; and (2) to provide a high- level venue for dialogue among Governments, businesses, experts and scholars to discuss economic, social, environmental and other issues important for Asia and the world. On the proposal of Fidel V. Ramos, former President of the Philippines, Bob Hawke, former Prime Minister of Australia, and Morihiro Hosokawa, former Prime Minister of Japan, representatives of 25 countries met in Hainan Province, China, on 19 November 2000, and agreed that the Boao Forum for Asia would be established and its headquarters permanently located at Boao. On 27 February 2001, the Charter of the Boao Forum for Asia was unanimously adopted by the representatives of all the participating countries, and 26 countries including China became initial countries of the Forum. In 2006 and 2016, upon the requests of their Governments, the Forum accepted Israel, New Zealand and the Maldives as initial countries in addition to the original list. The Boao Forum for Asia consists of the General Meeting of Members, the Board of Directors, the Secretariat, the Research and Training Institute and the Council of Advisers. The General Meeting of Members is the ultimate authority of the Forum, and includes 234 political and business leaders, government agencies, companies and think tanks from 36 countries and regions around the world (as at 31 July 2019). The Board of Directors functions as the supreme executive body of the General Meeting. The 19 board members include former political leaders, business leaders and former heads of international organizations, who are nominated by Governments of relevant countries and approved by the General Meeting. The incumbent Chair of the Board of Directors is Mr. Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary- General of the United Nations. In accordance with the Charter of the Boao Forum for Asia and the laws of China, the host country, the Forum possesses full juridical personality and has full capacity to contract, to acquire and to dispose of immovable and movable property, and to institute legal proceedings. In 2005, a memorandum of understanding was signed by the Chinese Government and the Forum, which ensures for the Forum treatment as an intergovernmental international organization with regard to premises, tax concessions, entry and exit and the like. To help Asian countries to achieve common development and deepen economic cooperation with other regions, the Boao Forum for Asia holds its annual conference in Boao in the spring. State leaders, business elites and opinion leaders from various countries are invited to discuss key issues on the economic and social development of Asia and the world, such as finance, trade, investment and the environment. During the annual conference, consensus is reached, and regional and international initiatives are launched through exchanges on an equal footing. At the invitation of Governments, businesses and think tanks, the Boao Forum for Asia organizes conferences in various countries in Asia and beyond to forge partnerships between the public and private sectors and promote trade and investment facilitation. The Boao Forum for Asia works closely with the United Nations specialized agencies and major international economic organizations in co-hosting conferences 3/6 A/74/293 in specialized areas, conducting joint studies and releasing reports on regional and global economic trends. In 2019, the Forum signed a cooperation agreement with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat and held the Global Health Forum with the World Health Organization to advance their shared goals. We believe that the Boao Forum for Asia, which is based in Asia and with a global outlook, provides intellectual support for the sustainable development of the Asian economy and actively promotes economic globalization. It commits to safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at the core and to upholding a multilateral trading system that is open, transparent, inclusive, just and equitable. As an international public good and a platform for exchange of ideas, the Forum is jointly initiated and operated by Asian countries and receives support from around the world. Its activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations in the socioeconomic fields. We are convinced that granting the Boao Forum for Asia observer status in the General Assembly will help to facilitate deeper and long-term cooperation between the Forum and the United Nations. This will not only support the collaboration between the Asian countries in the pursuit of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, but also promote the robust, inclusive and sustainable growth of the world economy. 4/6 A/74/293 List of initial countries of the Boao Forum for Asia — er nN anw FF YN NO NY NY NY WN KN NY NY NO RO RR ee ee NAAR HN = SSH NDA BR wWN FS The Commonwealth of Australia The People’s Republic of Bangladesh Brunei Darussalam The Kingdom of Cambodia The People’s Republic of China The Republic of India The Republic of Indonesia The Islamic Republic of Iran The State of Israel Japan The Republic of Kazakhstan The Kyrgyz Republic The Lao People’s Democratic Republic The Republic of Maldives Malaysia Mongolia The Republic of the Union of Myanmar The Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal New Zealand The Islamic Republic of Pakistan The Republic of the Philippines The Republic of Korea The Republic of Singapore The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka The Republic of Tajikistan The Kingdom of Thailand Turkmenistan The Republic of Uzbekistan The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam 5/6 A/74/293 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the Boao Forum for Asia in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Noting the aspiration of the Boao Forum for Asia to develop its cooperation with the United Nations, 1.
