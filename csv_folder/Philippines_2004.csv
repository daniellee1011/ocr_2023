the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international human rights instruments, and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of violence against women, Reaffirming the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/104 of 20 December 1993, Recalling the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted in September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women, follow-up action by the Commission on the Status of Women on violence against women, and

responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court

crime against humanity and/or a war crime, and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international

or remote communities, destitute women, women in institutions or in detention, the girl child, women with disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in situations of armed conflict are often especially targeted or vulnerable to violence, as are women who are otherwise discriminated against, Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls, and can be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action, including effective implementation of national legislation, against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple forms of discrimination against women, Welcomes: (a) The work of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and takes note of her report (E/CN.4/2004/66), in particular the elaboration of guidelines for developing strategies for the effective implementation of international standards to end violence against women at the national level and her proposal of an intervention strategy with three interrelated levels, consisting of the State, the community/non-state actors, and the (a) individual woman,; (b) The increasing efforts and important contributions at the national, regional and international levels to eliminate all forms of violence against women and encourages States to build upon these successful initiatives, and to support and participate in regional consultations; (c) The initiatives of the United Nations

Stresses that women should be empowered to protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, stresses that women have the right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; 9.
