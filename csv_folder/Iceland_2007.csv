A/62/L.24 Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, as a result of, inter alia, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, inadequate flag State control and enforcement, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures, inadequate regulatory measures, harmful fisheries subsidies and overcapacity, Noting the limited information available on measures taken by States to implement, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States, Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications, Recognizing also that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing may give rise to safety and security concerns for individuals on vessels engaged in such activities, and welcoming, in this regard, the adoption of the Work in Fishing Convention at the International Labour Conference in Geneva on 14 June 2007, Welcoming cooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Maritime Organization and the outcomes of the second session of the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/International Maritime Organization Ad Hoc Working Group on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and Related Matters, held from 16 to 18 July 2007, Recognizing the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (“the Compliance Agreement”),® the Agreement and the Code for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag, and vessels flying their flag which provide support to fishing vessels, to ensure that the activities of such fishing and support vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels, Noting the obligation of all States, pursuant to the provisions of the Convention, to cooperate in the conservation and management of living marine resources, and recognizing the importance of coordination and cooperation at the global, regional, subregional as well as national levels in the areas, inter alia, of data collection, information-sharing, capacity-building and training for the conservation, management and sustainable development of marine living resources, Welcoming recent developments regarding recommended best practices for regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements that may help to strengthen their governance and promote their improved performance, 6 International Fisheries Instruments with Index (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.98.V.11), sect. II. A/62/L.24 Calling attention to the need for States, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to continue to develop and implement effective port State measures and schemes to combat overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the critical need for cooperation with developing States to build their capacity in this regard, taking note of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop a legally binding instrument on minimum standards for port State measures, Concerned that marine pollution from all sources, including vessels and, in particular, land-based sources, constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, Welcoming the support by the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its twenty-seventh session, held from 5 to 9 March 2007, for a proposal that the Food and Agriculture Organization should undertake a scoping study to identify the key issues on climate change and fisheries, initiate a discussion on how the fishing industry can adapt to climate change, and for the Food and Agriculture Organization to take a lead in informing fishers and policymakers about the likely consequences of climate change for fisheries, Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, due to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary, Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing

fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, Calling attention to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to meet their obligations and exercise their rights under international instruments, in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources, Recognizing the need for appropriate measures to minimize by-catch, waste, discards, loss of fishing gear and other factors, which adversely affect fish stocks and may also have undesirable effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities, Recognizing also the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into fisheries conservation and management, and more generally the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem as key predatory species, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the fact that some are threatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and A/62/L.24 fisheries, and the relevance of the 1999 Food and Agriculture Organization International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks in providing guidance on the development of such measures, Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant regional and subregional fisheries Management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, while noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking, that only a small number of countries have implemented the 1999 Food and Agriculture Organization International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries, Expressing concern that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, although the incidence of this practice has continued to be low in most regions of the world’s oceans and seas, Emphasizing that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, Expressing concern over reports of continued losses of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality in fishing operations, particularly longline fishing, and other activities, while recognizing considerable efforts to reduce by-catch in longline fishing by States and through various regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General,” in particular its useful role in gathering and disseminating information on or relating to the sustainable development of the world’s living marine resources, I.
