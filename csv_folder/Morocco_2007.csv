Also stresses that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and that they must exercise due diligence in order to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms; 4. Calls upon States to take all necessary measures to ensure the rights of women and girls to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health, and develop sustainable health systems and social services, with a view to ensuring access to such systems and services without discrimination, while paying special attention to adequate food and nutrition, family planning information, increasing knowledge and awareness and securing appropriate prenatal and post-natal care for the prevention of obstetric fistula; 5. Also calls upon States to ensure that girls have equal access to free and compulsory primary education of good quality, and that they complete their education at that level, and to renew their efforts to improve and expand girls’ and women’s education at all levels, including at secondary and higher levels, as well as vocational education and technical training, in order to, inter alia, achieve gender equality, the empowerment of women and poverty eradication; 6.

Calls upon the international community to support the activities of the United Nations Population Fund and other partners in the Campaign to End Fistula, including the World Health Organization, in establishing and financing regional fistula treatment and training centres through identifying and supporting health facilities that have the potential to serve as centres for treatment, training and convalescent care; A/C.3/62/L.21/Rev.1 9. Encourages communication and networking among existing fistula centres to facilitate training, research, advocacy and fund-raising and the development and application of relevant standards, including Obstetric Fistula: Guiding Principles for Clinical Management and Programming Development of the World Health Organization,!° which provides background information along with principles for developing fistula prevention and treatment strategies and programmes; 10.
