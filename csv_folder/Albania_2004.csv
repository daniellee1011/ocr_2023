by the World Conference on Human Rights and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/104 of 20 December 1993, Recalling the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted in September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women, follow-up action by the Commission on the Status of Women on violence against women, and
