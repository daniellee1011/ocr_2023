Strongly condemns the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military intelligence facilities, and calls upon the Syrian regime to release all unlawfully held detainees, including women, children and the elderly, and to facilitate information about those still in detention as well as those who died while in detention by the Syrian regime, returning their remains, with full transparency regarding what happened to these individuals, and urges the regime to immediately reverse its abhorrent use of mass detentions and torture as means of silencing and repressing 16/18 political opposition, journalists and other media workers and of depriving Syrian citizens of their rights to freedom of expression; 50. Calls for the appropriate international monitoring bodies to be granted access to detainees in all prisons and detention centres, including all military facilities referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry; 51. Demands in this respect the immediate release of all persons arbitrarily or unlawfully detained by the Syrian regime, notes in particular the additional life- threatening risks to health created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the high risks that exacerbate the already dire situation of detainees, and notes in this regard the statements made by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Special Envoy and the Commission of Inquiry; 52.

Notes with concern the continued insecurity in the north-east of the Syrian Arab Republic and the restricted humanitarian space following the failure to reauthorize the Ya‘rubiyah border crossing, in Security Council resolutions 2504 (2020) and 2533 (2020), further compounded by lack of access to water and electricity, which continues to undermine the stability and security of the whole region, eroding progress in the fight against ISIL (also known as Da’esh) and worsening the humanitarian situation and humanitarian actors’ ability to respond to humanitarian needs; 56. Stresses the situation of particular concern in the northern part of the province of Aleppo, as well as Idlib, strongly condemns the attacks on civilians and first responders and civilian infrastructure where ongoing violence, including airstrikes, continues to cause death and injury among civilians and first responders, as well as devastating damage to civilian infrastructure, including health-care and educational facilities, and welcomes the establishment of the United Nations board of inquiry mandated to investigate the destruction of and damage to facilities on the United Nations deconfliction list and United Nations-supported facilities; 57.

Invites Member States to maintain the continued functioning of the health system in all relevant aspects, in accordance with national context and priorities, necessary for an effective public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other ongoing epidemics, and the uninterrupted and safe provision of population- and individual-level services, for, among others, communicable diseases, including through undisrupted vaccination programmes, neglected tropical diseases, non-communicable diseases, mental health, mother and child health and sexual and reproductive health, and promote improved nutrition for women and children, recognizing in this regard the importance of increased domestic financing and development assistance where needed in the context of achieving universal health coverage; 7. Encourages Member States to introduce, adjust or expand, as necessary, national social protection programmes and adapt targeting methodologies, as appropriate, to ensure access to social protection and assistance programmes that would support those affected by COVID-19, especially women, by expanding the reach and benefit levels of social assistance programmes, such as cash transfers and social pensions, as well as other programmes that can be implemented with low transaction cost, and to ensure that the information on the availability of and ways to access these social protection and assistance programmes is widely available and accessible to all women and girls, especially those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations; 8.

Urges Member States to prevent and respond to the increase of violence against women and girls amid the COVID-19 pandemic by integrating prevention, response and protection measures into COVID-19 response plans, including by designating and expanding the capacity of domestic violence shelters as essential services and increasing resources allocated to them, in collaboration with civil society on the front line of response, ensuring access to justice for women and girls who are victims of violence, and stepping up awareness-raising campaigns to address violence against women during confinement; 12. Recognizes the importance of strengthening the leadership and full and meaningful participation of women in all decision-making processes in the design and implementation of national response policies and strategies to address the COVID-19 outbreak, which poses multidimensional threats, and for which the promotion of people’s engagement and inclusiveness, particularly of women, families and communities, is fundamental for a more effective, immediate and rapid response; 13. Calls upon Member States to ensure that all relevant policies and procedures are responsive to the specific needs of women and girls in the light of the efforts made to reduce the impact of COVID-19, document the efforts of government on women-related policies to protect them and their family members from COVID-19, and implement all these policies with necessary supporting programmes and initiatives; 14.

Resolution 74/2. 2/7 further concern that, when taking care of infected family members, they are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19, Acknowledging that women and girls have specific health needs, that during the COVID-19 pandemic they must have equal access to COVID-19 prevention, mitigation and treatment interventions, as well as access to essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines and vaccines for all and effective primary health care, especially in indigenous and rural communities, and that negative social norms and gender stereotypes can have particular impacts during a widespread health crisis, Expressing concern that the spread of COVID-19 and its socioeconomic impact can negatively affect mental health, aggravated by factors such as job loss or wage cuts, inadequate or lack of nutritious food, and lack of access to safe water and sanitation and commodities, as well as additional responsibilities due to the closure of schools and care facilities, Deeply concerned that the negative socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to the progress that has been made in women’s economic empowerment, economic autonomy and productive lives, and may affect them disproportionately and differently from men, as they often earn less, save less, have less access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, have less access to credit and hold less secure jobs, they are also more likely to be employed in the informal sector, which leads to less access to social protection and pensions, and are at greater risk of falling into poverty, in particular when entitlements are tied closely to formal employment, they represent the majority of single-parent households, bear the majority of domestic and unpaid care work and spend longer hours than men on unpaid care work, and as they take on greater care demands at home, their jobs and income can also be disproportionately affected by cuts and layoffs, especially since households headed by women are far more likely to be economically disadvantaged, in particular in terms of exacerbating their risk of exposure to COVID-19, Recognizing that school closures, physical distancing and containment strategies may affect girls and boys differently, especially adolescent girls, who, owing to negative social norms, are more likely to be expected to take on unpaid care and domestic work, limiting their access to remote learning and other education support programmes, and may put them at a greater risk of being subjected to harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, as well as sexual and gender-based violence, child labour and trafficking in persons, which may lead to girls, and in particular girls living in poverty, girls with disabilities, indigenous girls, migrants, refugees and those living in rural and remote areas, leaving school before the completion of their education, Noting with concern that,
