participation, Recalling that the right to privacy, as well as freedom of expression and freedom of access to information, contribute to enabling the free development of an individual’s personality

medical and health data, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken on a mass scale, Recognizing that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, and that, while surveillance is not in itself a violation of human rights, any limitation to the right to privacy must adhere to the overarching principles of legality, necessity and proportionality, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory

capabilities of business enterprises to collect, process and use personal data can pose a risk to the right to privacy, Noting also the impact that certain business enterprises may have on the enjoyment of human rights, given that they may be able, through technological means or owing to a dominant position in the market, to influence or restrict the free flow of information, Welcoming measures taken by business enterprises, on a voluntary basis, to provide transparency to their users about their policies regarding requests by State authorities for access to user data and

concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities, Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting also in that respect that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Recognizing that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful environment in cyberspace is of paramount importance for the realization of the right to privacy in the digital age, 4/6 1.
