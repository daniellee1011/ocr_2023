sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, are impediments to the development of their full potential as equal partners in all aspects of life, as well as obstacles to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, Recognizing also the continuing need to increase women’s full and effective participation in all actions and activities related to the prevention and resolution of armed conflict, the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peacebuilding in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions, including its resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and related resolutions, Recognizing further that harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage continue to be an impediment to not only the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development of

of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and is critical for sustainable development and economic growth, Expressing concern about institutional and structural discrimination against women and girls, such as laws, policies, regulations, programmes, administrative procedures or A/HRC/26/L.26 structures and services that directly or indirectly regulate access to

that indigenous women and girls, women and girls with disabilities, older women, migrants and minorities often experience multiple forms of discrimination, which may increase their vulnerability to all forms of violence and limit their ability to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political autonomy, Expressing concern that social norms and legal constraints that restrict women’s agency in the public and private sphere and their economic independence can constrain a woman’s ability to leave an abusive or violent situation and reduce her ability to access protection and secure an adequate standard of living, Recognizing that violence against women has both short- and long-term adverse consequences for women’s health, including their sexual and reproductive health, and for the enjoyment of their human rights, and that respecting and promoting sexual and reproductive health, and protecting and fulfilling reproductive rights in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences is a necessary condition to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women to enable them to enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to prevent and mitigate violence against women, Recognizing also the important role of the United Nations system, in particular of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, in addressing discrimination and violence against women and girls at the global, regional and national levels and in assisting States, upon their request, in their efforts to eliminate and prevent all forms of violence against women and girls, and highlighting

financial institutions, regional development banks, civil society, including non- governmental organizations, the private sector, employer organizations, trade unions, media and other relevant organizations can play in supporting State action to promote women’s economic empowerment and political participation, which can help reduce violence against women and girls, Taking particular note of the report of the High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda,’ and noting other relevant contributions by United Nations agencies, programmes and funds on the post-2015

and welcoming therefore the emphasis placed by States on the topic of sanitation, for instance in General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, in which States committed to, inter alia, redouble efforts to close the sanitation gap through scaled-up ground-level action, as well as the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of Sanitation for All, pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Concerned that the official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions as a critical part of securing access to safe drinking water as well as the safe management of sanitation, Reaffirming that non-discrimination and equality are fundamental human rights principles, and concerned that inequalities in the realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation persist, inter alia, between urban and rural areas and between formal and informal areas in cities, and insisting that much remains to be done on safety, equality and non-discrimination issues, Concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including menstrual hygiene management, and the widespread stigma associated with menstruation have a negative impact on gender equality and the human rights of women and girls, Recognizing that, in realizing the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights for a rapidly growing world population, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Recalling General Assembly resolution 67/291, entitled “Sanitation for All”, in which the Assembly encouraged all Member States, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including hygiene promotion, the provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage and wastewater treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management, Affirming the need to adequately consider the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while defining concrete goals, targets and indicators, Reaffirming its encouragement to Member States to intensify global partnerships for development as a means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation, Reaffirming also the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and A/HRC/27/L.11/Rev.1 affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity;

Recalls that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 3. Alarmed by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign “Sustainable sanitation: the five- year drive to 2015”, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 4. Welcomes the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals proposed in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater treatment, and that special attention be given to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, and invites States to consider adequately the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; 5. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and the undertaking of country missions; 6.

Alarmed by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign “Sustainable sanitation: the five- year drive to 2015”, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 4. Welcomes the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals proposed in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater treatment, and that special attention be given to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, and invites States to reflect adequately the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the post-2015 development agenda; 5. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and the undertaking of country missions; 6.
