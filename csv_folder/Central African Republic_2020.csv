I, resolution 1, annex. '! Resolution 74/2. 2/7 further concern that, when taking care of infected family members, they are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19, Acknowledging that women and girls have specific health needs, that during the COVID-19 pandemic they must have equal access to COVID-19 prevention, mitigation and treatment interventions, as well as access to essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines and vaccines for all and effective primary health care, especially in indigenous and rural communities, and that negative social norms and gender stereotypes can have particular impacts during a widespread health crisis, Expressing concern that the spread of COVID-19 and its socioeconomic impact can negatively affect mental health, aggravated by factors such as job loss or wage cuts, inadequate or lack of nutritious food, and lack of access to safe water and sanitation and commodities, as well as additional responsibilities due to the closure of schools and care facilities, Deeply concerned that the negative socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to the progress that has been made in women’s economic empowerment, economic autonomy and productive lives, and may affect them disproportionately and differently from men, as they often earn less, save less, have less access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, have less access to credit and hold less secure jobs, they are also more likely to be employed in the informal sector, which leads to less access to social protection and pensions, and are at greater risk of falling into poverty, in particular when entitlements are tied closely to formal employment, they represent the majority of single-parent households, bear the majority of domestic and unpaid care work and spend longer hours than men on unpaid care work, and as they take on greater care demands at home, their jobs and income can also be disproportionately affected by cuts and layoffs, especially since households headed by women are far more likely to be economically disadvantaged, in particular in terms of exacerbating their risk of exposure to COVID-19, Recognizing that school closures, physical distancing and containment strategies may affect girls and boys differently, especially adolescent girls, who, owing to negative social norms, are more likely to be expected to take on unpaid care and domestic work, limiting their access to remote learning and other education support programmes, and may put them at a greater risk of being subjected to harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, as well as sexual and gender-based violence, child labour and trafficking in persons, which may lead to girls, and in particular girls living in poverty, girls with disabilities, indigenous girls, migrants, refugees and those living in rural and remote areas, leaving school before the completion of their education, Noting with concern that, owing to school closures, the COVID-19 crisis has exposed the digital divide, both between and within countries, including the gender digital divide and vast disparities in the availability of learning materials, including access to the Internet, and communication devices, and that even though much focus has turned to remote learning platforms, many public schools, especially in developing countries, are not set up to use them or do not have the technology and equipment to provide online teaching, which leads to limited or lack of education for many children, especially girls, Deeply concerned by the increase in cases of gender-based violence, including domestic violence, as a result of lockdown measures, the lack of availability of protection services and the increased challenges to holding perpetrators accountable, which also affect front-line health workers and community health volunteers, 3/7 Stressing the importance of the systematic collection and use of quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by sex, age, disability and other characteristics relevant in national contexts as an essential tool for the design, implementation and evaluation of effective policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery, Condemning social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against those infected with COVID-19, which can negatively affect their caregivers, family members, friends and communities, and recognizing that addressing those challenges is also a critical element in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, Concerned at the proliferation of disinformation and misinformation about the pandemic, especially in the digital space, and stressing the importance of providing data and information to the public to counter such practices, Recognizing the fundamental role of the United Nations system in catalysing and coordinating the comprehensive global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the central efforts of Member States therein, recalling the constitutional mandate of the World Health Organization to act, inter alia, as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work, and recognizing its key leadership role within the broader United Nations response and the importance of strengthened multilateral cooperation in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and its extensive negative impacts, 1. Pledges to take further concrete action to ensure the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development during the response to the pandemic, with a view to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and the full and equal enjoyment of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms; 2.

Encourages Member States to take the necessary measures to implement people-centred, gender-sensitive, context-specific, whole-of-government and whole- of-society, and prevention-oriented responses when designing their health preparedness and response plans for COVID-19, outlining both immediate and long- term actions, taking into account the direct and indirect impacts on women and girls’ health and their specific needs, including by: (a) Ensuring the accessibility and availability of quality health care, including ongoing access to essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines for all, without discrimination of any kind, with particular attention to patients with chronic diseases, older women, victims of violence, antenatal and postnatal care and delivery 4/7 services, including emergency obstetric and newborn care, putting in place necessary infection control measures and maintaining HIV/AIDS voluntary and confidential testing, counselling and treatment access with no interruptions, particularly, but not exclusively, in terms of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, and recognizing, in this regard, the role of extensive immunization against COVID-19 as a global public good for health in preventing, containing and stopping transmission in order to bring the pandemic to an end, once safe, quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and affordable vaccines are available; (b) Ensuring a sufficient supply of hygiene kits and necessary medical supplies, voluntary and informed family planning methods for women and sanitary pads for all women and girls, as well as the provision of care through innovative strategies such as mobile clinics; (c) Ensuring that verified and scientific COVID-19 public health messages, including targeted prevention and precautionary measures to be taken at the individual and community levels, are developed and disseminated, as appropriate, in accessible formats and through multiple media platforms to ensure that these messages are widely available to all women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, pregnant women, older women, women living with HIV/AIDS, internally displaced, refugee and migrant women and girls, as well as indigenous women and women living in remote and rural communities; (d) Taking appropriate measures to address the specific physical, mental and psychological health needs of and psychosocial support for female front-line health workers and to create a safe, enabling and violence-free working environment for them; providing appropriate personal protective equipment, including essential hygiene and sanitation items, and access to safe and affordable water, particularly for those female health workers quarantined; addressing the gender pay gap, where it exists, in the health sector; and ensuring their full, effective and meaningful participation in decision-making and response planning; (ec) Developing, as appropriate, psychological services as well as other community-based solutions, including making use of digital spaces, for the provision of mental health and psychosocial support for women and girls; (f) Engaging all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, women’s organizations, youth-led organizations, the private sector and academia, through, inter alia, participatory and transparent multi-stakeholder platforms and partnerships, to provide input to the development, implementation and evaluation of policies responsive to COVID-19, in order to take into account the specific needs of women and girls; 6. | Urges Member States to allocate resources to the continuation of universal access to health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, such as family planning and maternal health care for women to prevent high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, as well as the exposure of pregnant women to the virus in health facilities, including while accessing antenatal care and delivery; 7. Encourages Member States to introduce, adjust or expand, as necessary, national social protection programmes and adapt targeting methodologies, as appropriate, to ensure access to social protection and assistance programmes that would support those affected by COVID-19, especially women, by expanding the reach and benefit levels of social assistance programmes, including to those working in the informal sector, such as cash transfers and social pensions, as well as other programmes that can be implemented with low transaction cost, and to ensure that the information on the availability of and ways to access these social protection and assistance programmes is widely available and accessible to all women and girls, especially those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations; 5/7 8. Calls upon Member States to uphold children’s right to education, and in that regard urges them to ensure girls’ access to quality education by implementing appropriate measures, including, when relevant, by supporting families to allow their children, in particular girls, to return to school in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic and promote continuous education throughout the pandemic; 9. Encourages Member States to ensure access to infrastructure and public services, including access to safe and affordable water and sanitation, as well as menstrual hygiene management for all women and girls, and safe and affordable transportation, inter alia during humanitarian emergencies, including in rural areas and informal settlements, settlements for internally displaced persons, refugee camps, as well as migrant shelters; 10. Recognizes that older women, women and girls with disabilities and those with underlying medical conditions require special attention because of their higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19, and in this regard encourages Member States to develop the necessary measures to support them as well as help household caregivers, including by ensuring access to and continuity of essential care for older persons and persons with disabilities, while ensuring that older persons and persons with disabilities are treated with respect and on an equal basis, and to implement more flexible measures for those employees who are caregivers in their household by considering expanding access to paid leave and paid sick leave; 11. Urges Member States to take effective measures to prevent and respond to the increase of violence against women and girls amid the COVID-19 pandemic by integrating evidence-based prevention, response and protection measures, including by designating and expanding the capacity of domestic violence shelters as essential services and supporting them, as well as increasing resources, in collaboration with civil society on the front line of response, ensuring access to justice for women and girls who are victims of violence and stepping up advocacy and awareness -raising campaigns to address all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls, particularly during confinement; 12.

'2 Resolution 68/3. 2/10 the persistent gaps in this regard, and identifies good practices and recommended actions in accessibility for the effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the disability-inclusive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Welcoming progress towards mainstreaming disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in the work of the United Nations, and noting with appreciation the launch of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and the leadership of the Secretary-General to bring about transformative and systematic change on disability inclusion across the United Nations system, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters, Recognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, and that persons with disabilities and their families should receive social protection and assistance to enable the family and its members to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with disabilities, Recognizing further the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality, non-discrimination and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Concerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to obtain health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, a lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, 3/10 Recognizing that persons with disabilities are directly and _ indirectly disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated existing inequalities, discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion and increased the risk of unemployment and poverty, as well as of violence and abuse, in particular against women and girls with disabilities, recognizing also that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as face barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may have higher rates of underlying risk factors, and have a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 disease, developing severe health conditions or being fatally affected by it, Reaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Taking note of the initiatives that the Secretary-General, United Nations agencies and United Nations entities have undertaken in order to promote disability inclusion in COVID-19 response and recovery efforts as a vital step towards achieving the pledge to leave no one behind, and noting in this regard the importance of promoting equal access of persons with disabilities to social services, quality education and health care, full and productive employment and decent work, encouraging their effective and meaningful participation, protecting their human rights, eliminating discrimination against them, and systematically collecting and using data disaggregated by sex, age and disability, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, Recognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities into development policies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, meaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development 4/10 programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,!* and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high- 3 Such as the Guidelines and Principles for the Development of Disability Statistics (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.01.XVII.15) and the Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses (United Nations

society, as well as economic and political life, Recognizing further the special needs of women and girls living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism, and that global health threats, climate change, more frequent and intense natural disasters, conflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related humanitarian crises and the forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent decades and have particular negative impacts on women and girls that need to be comprehensively assessed and addressed, Recognizing that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its impunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for action by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such violence may include stalking, death threats and threats of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as related trends against women and girls in digital contexts, such as trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, including unwanted verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women and girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, Alarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, including gender- related killings of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the world, which constitutes an extreme form of violence against women and girls, is among the least punished crimes, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including in ending impunity for such crimes, Gravely concerned that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, remains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all social strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse or impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, as such, is unacceptable, Stressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in preventing and eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and sexual harassment, Recognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such violence the family can play an important role, 3/10 Deeply concerned by the increased violence against women and girls around the world, including domestic

response to the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, and facilitate reporting thereon, and to ensure that all women and girls can lead lives free from violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination, including through the use of digital technologies, media, helplines or the mobilization of grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and other service providers to help victims to find safe spaces and seek support, Underscoring that, often, a lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, persisting impunity, all forms of discrimination, including structural discrimination, insufficient recourse for victims of violence against women and girls, gender stereotypes and negative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as well as negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced income, prevent many women and girls, as applicable, from reporting or acting as witnesses and from seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Acknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, and in this regard stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, '° as well as of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, ""” Emphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data on violence against women and girls, including disaggregated data, and on its prevalence, patterns and drivers, as well as on effective approaches to prevent and respond to it impedes efforts to design and implement measures, including, where appropriate, policies and legislation, to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, Encouraging the removal of all barriers to women’s access to justice and ensuring that they all have access to information about their rights as well as effective legal assistance so that they can make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal proceedings and issues relating to family law, and also ensuring that they have access to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, including formal and appropriate informal justice mechanisms, as provided for by national legislation and, where necessary, the adoption of national legislation, 16 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2237, No. 39574. 'T Resolution 64/293. 4/10 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors such as a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing sexual and gender-based violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, Recognizing the need to promote the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and women’s organizations, including victims and survivors of violence, in the development, implementation and evaluation of gender-responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of women and girls and their access to education and essential health services, the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, are deepening already existing inequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls made in recent decades, 1.
