GE.11-12029 A/HRC/16/L.17 Reaffirming the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, Recalling the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009; Bearing in mind paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security, Convinced that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made on reducing hunger, and that they will increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to adequate food is violated on a massive scale, as a combination of several major factors, including speculation on food commodities and macroeconomic factors, also affected negatively by environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of development and transfer of relevant technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries, Concerned by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and alarmed at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, and especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, Noting that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are factors contributing to destitution and desperation and have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, A/HRC/16/L.17 Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing countries, Reaffirming international commitments on official development assistance and stressing the importance of that assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, Recalling the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional farmers and the most vulnerable groups and national and international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable investment in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Recalling its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council, and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2.

Expresses grave concern at the evolution of the world food crisis, which seriously undermines the realization of the right to food for all, especially for one sixth of the world population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, who suffer from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity; 4. Considers it intolerable that, according to an estimation by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are undernourished is nine hundred and twenty five million worldwide, and that there is an additional one billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed twelve billion people; 5. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7.

Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small- scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches, and encourages States and donors, both public and private, to examine and A/HRC/16/L.17 consider ways to integrate the recommendations contained in the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food’ in policies and programmes; 15. | Recognizes that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and provision of the right to food; 16. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 17. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 18. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 19.

Reaffirms that such acts may be qualified to fall within the scope of activities described in article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination? and that they may represent a clear and manifest abuse of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association as well as the rights to freedom of opinion and expression within the meaning of those rights as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,’ the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights’ and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 8. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World War, in particular those committed by the SS organization and those who fought against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement, and poison the minds of young people, and that failure by States to effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of States Members of the United Nations under its Charter and is incompatible with the purposes and principles of the Organization; 9.

Emphasizes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur regarding the importance of history classes in teaching the dramatic events and human suffering that resulted from the ideologies of Nazism and Fascism; 14. Stresses the importance of other positive measures and initiatives aimed at bringing communities together and providing them with space for genuine dialogue, such as round tables, working groups and seminars, including training seminars for State agents and media professionals, as well as awareness-raising activities, especially those initiated by civil society representatives which require continued State support; 15. Underlines the potentially positive role that relevant United Nations entities and programmes, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, can play in the aforementioned areas; 16. Reaffirms that, according to article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, States parties to that instrument are under the obligation: (a) To condemn all propaganda and all organizations that are based on ideas of racial superiority or that attempt to justify or promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form; (b) To undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, such discrimination, with due regard to the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth in article 5 of the Convention; (c) To declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, and incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof; (d) To declare illegal and prohibit organizations and organized and all other propaganda activities that promote and incite racial discrimination, and to recognize participation in such organizations or activities as an offence punishable by law; (e) To prohibit public authorities or public institutions, national or local, from promoting or inciting racial discrimination; 17.

Expresses concern about the use of the Internet to propagate racism, racial hatred, xenophobia, racial discrimination and related intolerance, as outlined in the latest report of the Special Rapporteur to the General Assembly, and in this regard calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to implement fully articles 19 and 20 of the Covenant, which guarantee the right to freedom of expression and set out the limitations thereto; 19.

Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 do so from hunger-related illness, and that, as estimated by the Food and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (C 2006/REP), appendix G. A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are undernourished is about 925 million worldwide, and that an additional 1 billion people are suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences on the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries; 5. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7.

Recognizes the advances reached through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 11. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development are essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 12. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets, and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 13. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 1° 14. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity!! and to consider becoming parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture !2 as a matter of priority; 15. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples'® and acknowledges that many indigenous’ organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 16. Notes the need to further examine various concepts such as, inter alia, “food sovereignty” and their relation with food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 17. Requests all States and private actors, as well as_ international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 18. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 12 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the Conference of FAO, Thirty-first Session, Rome, 2-13 November 2001 (C 2001/REP), appendix D.

Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 23. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in this regard, and invites once again all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security’ and the United Nations Millennium Declaration;* 24. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 25. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 26. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 27.
