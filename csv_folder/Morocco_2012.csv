Definitions 1. For land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol, the following definitions, in addition to those contained in decision 16/CMP.1 and referred to in decision 2/CMP.6, paragraph 2, shall apply: (a) “Natural disturbances” are non-anthropogenic events or non-anthropogenic circumstances. For the purposes of this decision, these events or circumstances are those that cause significant emissions in forests and are beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, a Party. These may include wildfires, insect and disease infestations, extreme weather events and/or geological disturbances, beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, a Party. These exclude harvesting and prescribed burning; (b) “Wetland drainage and rewetting” is a system of practices for draining and rewetting on land with organic soil that covers a minimum area of 1 hectare. The activity applies to all lands that have been drained since 1990 and to all lands that have been rewetted since 1990 and that are not accounted for under any other activity as defined in this annex, where drainage is the direct human-induced lowering of the soil water table and rewetting is the direct human-induced partial or total reversal of drainage. B. Article 3, paragraph 3 2. For the purposes of Article 3, paragraph 3, eligible activities are those direct human- induced afforestation, reforestation and/or deforestation activities that meet the requirements set forth in this annex and that started on or after 1 January 1990 and before 31 December of the last year of the commitment period. 3. For the purposes of determining the area of deforestation to come under the accounting system under Article 3, paragraph 3, each Party shall determine the forest area using the same spatial assessment unit as is used for the determination of afforestation and reforestation, but this must be not larger than 1 hectare. 4. Each Party included in Annex I shall report, in accordance with Article 7, on how harvesting or forest disturbance that is followed by the re-establishment of a forest is distinguished from deforestation. This information will be subject to review in accordance with Article 8. 5. Each Party included in Annex I shall report and account for, in accordance with Article 7, all emissions arising from the conversion of natural forests to planted forests. C. Article 3, paragraph 4 6. A Party included in Annex I may choose to account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from any or all of the following 13 FCCC/KP/CMP/2011/10/Add.1 activities: revegetation, cropland management, grazing land management, and wetland drainage and rewetting. 7. All Parties included in Annex I shall account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from the following: any activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, elected in the first commitment period, and forest management. 8. A Party included in Annex I wishing to account for elected activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, in the second commitment period shall identify, in its report to enable the establishment of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, or any amendments thereto, the activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, that it elects to include in its accounting for the second commitment period. Upon election, a decision by a Party will be fixed for the second commitment period. 9. During the second commitment period, a Party included in Annex I shall demonstrate that activities referred to in paragraph 6 above, in addition to those already selected for the first commitment period, have occurred since 1990 and are human-induced. A Party included in Annex I shall not account for emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, if these are already accounted for under Article 3, paragraph 3. 10. For the second commitment period, accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from revegetation, cropland Management, grazing land management, and wetland drainage and rewetting under Article 3, paragraph 4, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period, less the duration of the commitment period in years times the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from these eligible activities in the base year of that Party, while avoiding double accounting. 11. Accounting for wetland drainage and rewetting shall be based on estimation methodologies for wetlands, lands converted to wetlands and land use on drained organic soils in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines most recently adopted or encouraged by the Conference of the Parties, and any subsequent clarifications agreed by the Conference of the Parties. 12. For the second commitment period, accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period, less the duration of the commitment period in years times the reference level inscribed in the appendix.' 13. For the second commitment period, additions to the assigned amount of a Party resulting from forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, and from forest management project activities undertaken under Article 6, shall not exceed 3.5 per cent of the base year greenhouse gas emissions excluding land use, land-use change and forestry The forest management reference levels inscribed in the appendix to this annex were set transparently, taking into account: (a) removals or emissions from forest management as shown in greenhouse gas inventories and relevant historical data; (b) age-class structure; (c) forest management activities already undertaken; (d) projected forest management activities under business as usual; (e) continuity with the treatment of forest management in the first commitment period; and (f) the need to exclude removals from accounting in accordance with decision 16/CMP.1, paragraph 1. Points (c), (d) and (e) above were applied where relevant. The forest management reference levels also took into account the need for consistency with the inclusion of carbon pools and the provisions for addressing natural disturbances contained in paragraphs 33-35 below. 14 FCCC/KP/CMP/2011/10/Add.1 pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, or any amendments thereto, times the duration of the commitment period in years. 14. When accounting for forest management, Annex I Parties shall demonstrate methodological consistency between the reference level and reporting for forest management during the second commitment period, including in the area accounted for, in the treatment of harvested wood products, and in the accounting of any emissions from natural disturbances. Parties shall make technical corrections, if necessary, to ensure consistency, including applying IPCC methods for ensuring time-series consistency (e.g. overlap with historical data) and shall report on how these corrections were made. Information on technical corrections and methodological consistency shall be reported as part of the annual greenhouse gas inventories and inventory reports, in accordance with relevant decisions under Articles 5 and 7 of the Kyoto Protocol, and reviewed as part of the review of the annual greenhouse gas inventory review in accordance with relevant decisions under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. 15. After adoption of the reference level for forest management, if the reported data on forest management or forest land remaining forest land used to establish the reference level are subject to recalculations, a technical correction shall be applied to include in the accounting the impact of the recalculations on the reported data that have been used by the Party to set the reference level. 16. Emissions that occur during the second commitment period from harvested wood products removed from forests prior to the start of the second commitment period shall also be accounted for. In the case the forest management reference level is based on a projection, a Party may choose not to account for the emissions from harvested wood products originating from forests prior to the start of the second commitment period, and shall ensure consistency in the treatment of the harvested wood products pool in the second commitment period in accordance with paragraph 14 above. Emissions from harvested wood products already accounted for during the first commitment period on the basis of instantaneous oxidation shall be excluded. The treatment of harvested wood products in the construction of a projected forest management reference level shall be on the basis of provisions outlined in paragraph 29 below and shall not be on the basis of instantaneous oxidation.” D. Article 12 17. Afforestation and reforestation are eligible project activities under the clean development mechanism in the second commitment period. Activities additional to afforestation and reforestation will be eligible if agreed by any future decision of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. 18. The modalities and procedures contained in decision 5/CMP.1 for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism, and in decision 6/CMP.1 for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism, shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the second commitment period. Alternative approaches to addressing the risk of non-permanence may apply in accordance with any future decisions of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. 19. For the second commitment period, the total of additions to a Party’s assigned amount resulting from afforestation and reforestation project activities under Article 12 > Taking in to account the provisions of paragraph 32 below. 15 FCCC/KP/CMP/2011/10/Add.1 shall not exceed one per cent of the base year emissions of that Party, times the duration of the commitment period in years. E. General 20. Each Party included in Annex I shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of “forest” as contained in decision 16/CMP.1, apply the definition of forest selected in the first commitment period. 21. Those Parties included in Annex I that did not select a definition of forest for the first commitment period shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of “forest” as contained in decision 16/CMP.1, select a single minimum tree crown cover value of between 10 and 30 per cent, a single minimum land area value of between 0.05 and 1 hectare and a single minimum tree height value of between 2 and 5 metres. 22. For the second commitment period, and subject to other provisions in this annex, the additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, or any amendments thereto, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and to non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the commitment period resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, that have taken place since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink of greenhouse gases, this value shall be added to the assigned amount of that Party. Where the result of this calculation is a net source of greenhouse gas emissions, this value shall be subtracted from the assigned amount of that Party. 23. The accounting of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, shall begin with the onset of the activity or the beginning of the commitment period, whichever comes later. 24. Once land is accounted for under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, this land must be accounted for throughout subsequent and contiguous commitment periods. 25. National inventory systems established under Article 5, paragraph 1, shall ensure that areas of land subject to land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, are identifiable, and information on these areas shall be provided by each Party included in Annex I in their national inventories in accordance with Article 7. Such information will be reviewed in accordance with Article 8. 26. Each Party included in Annex I shall account for all changes in the following carbon pools: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon and harvested wood products.’ With the exception of harvested wood products, a Party may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period, if transparent and verifiable information is provided that demonstrates that the pool is not a source. 27. Emissions from harvested wood products removed from forests which are accounted for by a Party under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, shall be accounted for by that Party only. Imported harvested wood products, irrespective of their origin, shall not be accounted for by the importing Party. 28. | Accounting shall be on the basis of instantaneous oxidation. 29. Notwithstanding paragraph 28 above, and provided that transparent and verifiable activity data for the harvested wood product categories specified below are available, 16 FCCC/KP/CMP/2011/10/Add.1 accounting shall be on the basis of the change in the harvested wood products pool during the second and subsequent commitment periods, estimated using the first-order decay function* with default half-lives’ of two years for paper, 25 years for wood panels and 35 years for sawn wood. 30. A Party may use country-specific® data to replace the default half-lives specified above, or to account for such products in accordance with the definitions and estimation methodologies in the most recently adopted IPCC guidelines and any subsequent clarifications agreed by the Conference of the Parties, provided that verifiable and transparent activity data are available and that the methodologies used are at least as detailed or accurate as those prescribed above. 31. Harvested wood products resulting from deforestation shall be accounted for on the basis of instantaneous oxidation. 32. Where carbon dioxide emissions from harvested wood products in solid waste disposal sites are separately accounted for, this shall be on the basis of instantaneous oxidation. Carbon dioxide emissions from wood harvested for energy purposes shall be accounted for on the basis of instantaneous oxidation. 33. | With respect to the treatment of natural disturbances emissions: (a) A Party shall indicate whether it intends to apply this provision to forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, during the second commitment period, in which case it shall provide country-specific information in its national greenhouse gas inventory report for 2015 on a forest management background level’ of emissions associated with annual natural disturbances that have been included in its forest management reference level, how the background level has been estimated and information on how to avoid the expectation of net credits or net debits during the commitment period, including through the use of a margin, where a margin is needed.® When accounting for forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, and provided that requirements of paragraph 34 below are met, a Party may exclude from the accounting, either annually or at the end of the second commitment period, emissions from natural disturbances that in any single year exceed the forest management background level. Any subsequent removals during the commitment period on the lands affected shall also be excluded from the accounting. Parties may only exclude emissions from disturbances in years where those emissions are above the background level plus the margin, where a margin is needed; 4 Using equation 12.1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as a basis for estimating changes in the harvested wood products pool during a commitment period. Half-lives are based on table 3a.1.3 of the 2003 IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land- Use Change and Forestry. In the case of exported harvested wood products, country-specific data refers to country-specific half- lives and harvested wood products usage in the importing country. The background level can be defined as the average of a consistent and initially complete time series containing 1990-2009 emissions associated with natural disturbances after the application of an iterative process to remove outliers, based on twice the standard deviation around the mean until no outliers can be identified. Alternatively, Parties may apply a transparent and comparable country- specific approach using a consistent and initially complete time series of data including for the period containing 1990-2009. All approaches shall avoid the expectation of net credits during the commitment period. If a Party’s forest management reference level does not include a background level of emissions, for the application of the background level as referred to in paragraph 33(a), a value for the background level would be estimated by applying the first approach mentioned above. In the case that the background level is defined using the first approach in footnote 7, the margin would equal twice the standard deviation of the time series defining the background level. In the case that the background level is defined using a country-specific approach or the Party’s reference level is zero, the Party must describe how a margin is established, where a margin is needed. All approaches shall avoid the expectation of net credits during the commitment period. 17 FCCC/KP/CMP/2011/10/Add.1 (b) A Party shall indicate whether it intends to apply this provision during the second commitment period to afforestation and reforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, in which case it shall provide country-specific information in its national greenhouse gas inventory report for 2015 on an afforestation and reforestation background level of emissions associated with annual natural disturbances,’ how the background level has been estimated and information on how to avoid the expectation of net credits or net debits during the commitment period, including through the use of a margin, where a margin is needed. When accounting for afforestation and reforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, and provided that the requirements of paragraph 34 below are met, a Party may exclude from the accounting, either annually or at the end of the second commitment period, emissions from natural disturbances that in any single year exceed the afforestation and reforestation background level. Any subsequent removals during the commitment period on the lands affected shall also be excluded from the accounting. Parties may only exclude emissions from disturbances in years where those emissions are above the background level plus the margin, where a margin is needed; (c) Parties shall account for emissions associated with salvage logging; (d) Parties shall not exclude from accounting emissions from natural disturbances on those lands that are subject to land-use change following the disturbance. 34. A Party included in Annex I that applies the provisions described in paragraph 33 above shall calculate the net emissions and removals subject to those provisions and shall provide transparent information: (a) Showing that all lands subject to paragraph 33(a) and (b) above are identified, including their georeferenced location, year and types of disturbances; (b) Showing how annual emissions resulting from disturbances and the subsequent removals in those areas are estimated; (c) Showing that no land-use change has occurred on lands for which the provisions in paragraph 33 above are applied and explaining the methods and criteria for identifying any future land-use changes on those land areas during the commitment period; (d) That demonstrates that the occurrences were beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, the Party in the commitment period, by demonstrating practicable efforts to prevent, manage or control the occurrences that led to the application of the provisions contained in paragraph 33 above; (e) That demonstrates efforts taken to rehabilitate, where practicable, the land for which the provisions in paragraph 33 above are applied; (f) Showing that emissions associated with salvage logging were not excluded from accounting. 35. | The supplementary information described in paragraph 34 above shall be included in the national greenhouse gas inventory reports of Parties that apply paragraph 33 above. All information and estimates referred to in paragraphs 33 and 34 above shall be subject to review as part of the periodical review of annual greenhouse gas inventory reports submitted by Parties. 36. The treatment of emissions and removals that occur on the lands referred to in paragraph 33 above in the subsequent commitment periods shall be reflected in land use, land-use change and forestry accounting for those commitment periods. ° The afforestation and reforestation background level of emissions associated with disturbances and a margin, where a margin is needed, shall be calculated using a methodology consistent with the one used by the Party to calculate the forest management background level. 18 FCCC/KP/CMP/2011/10/Add.1 37. A Party included in Annex I may include in its accounting of forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from the harvest and conversion of forest plantations, accounted for under forest management, to non-forest land, provided that all of the requirements below are met: (a) The forest plantation was first established through direct human-induced planting and/or seeding of non-forest land before 1 January 1990, and, if the forest plantation was re-established, that this last occurred on forest land through direct human- induced planting and/or seeding after 1 January 1960; (b) A new forest of at least equivalent area as the harvested forest plantation is established through direct human-induced planting and/or seeding of non-forested land that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989; (c) This newly established forest will reach at least the equivalent carbon stock that was contained in the harvested forest plantation at the time of harvest, within the normal harvesting cycle of the harvested forest plantation, and, if not, a debit would be generated under Article 3, paragraph 4. 38. All lands and associated carbon pools subject to the provision described in paragraph 37 above shall be accounted for as forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, and not under Article 3, paragraph 3. 39. All lands and associated carbon pools subject to paragraph 37 above shall be identified, monitored and reported, including the georeferenced location and year of conversion.

Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, Recalling the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food and nutrition security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food and nutrition insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis as a combination of several major factors, including speculation on food commodities and macroeconomic factors, also affected negatively by environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of development and transfer of relevant technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in particular in the said countries, Concerned by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and alarmed at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, A/HRC/19/L.21 Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, Recognizing the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including women, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Stressing the importance of reversing the substantial decline of assistance devoted to agriculture since 1980, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, while noting the recent partial inversion of this trend, Recalling the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, and the most vulnerable groups, as well as national and international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable investment in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Expresses grave concern at the evolution of the world food crisis, which has been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis and seriously undermines the realization of the right to food for all, especially for one sixth of the world population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, who suffer from hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity; 4. Considers it intolerable that, according to an estimation by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are undernourished is nine hundred and twenty five million worldwide, and that there is an additional one billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed twelve billion people; 5. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Recognizes the importance of smallholder farmers in developing countries, including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring food and nutrition security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their development; A/HRC/19/L.21 7. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 8. Stresses the need to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including, in particular, rural women and vulnerable groups; 9. Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food and nutrition insecurity to integrate and effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 10. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 11. | Encourages States to mainstream a human rights perspective in building and reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to: (a) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to adequate food, with a view to facing them; (b) — Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to contributing to the realization of the right to food; (c) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between national and subnational levels of government; (d) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that require progressive implementation; (e) Ensure adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure segments of the population; (f) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most vulnerable segments of society; 12. Underlines the significance of national government policies and strategies on food production and poverty alleviation; 13. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food and nutrition security, with a special focus on the gender-sensitive dimension; 14. Calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; A/HRC/19/L.21 15. Calls upon States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 16. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small- scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches, and encourages States and donors, both public and private, to examine and consider ways to integrate, where applicable and according to national contexts, the recommendations contained in the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food! in policies and programmes; 17. Recognizes that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools to achieve food and nutrition security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and the provision of the right to food; 18.

Please reeyele OO GE. 12-14724 A/HRC/20/L.17 Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, Emphasizing that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the international community to make all efforts to help to alleviate the external debt burden of developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such countries to attain the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their people, Stressing the determination expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income developing countries through various national and international measures designed to make their debt sustainable in the long term, Noting with concern that the total external debt of emerging and developing economies rose from 2,678.4 billion United States dollars in 2003 to 5,414.6 billion dollars in 2010 and is projected to rise to 6,446.3 billion dollars in 2012, and that debt service payments rose from 795.2 billion dollars in 2003 to 1,743.7 billion dollars in 2010, and were projected to rise to 2,010.8 billion and 2,265.5 billion in 2011 and 2012 respectively, Acknowledging that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people- centred sustainable development and poverty eradication and that, for many developing countries and countries with economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide basic services to create the conditions for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, Expressing its concern that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing countries continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official development assistance, Affirming that debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing developing countries, contributes to extreme poverty and is an obstacle to sustainable human development, and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 1. Welcomes the submission of the report of the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights;' 2. Also welcomes the work and contributions of the Independent Expert and endorses the guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights, as annexed to his report; 3. Encourages all Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, as well as the private sector, to take into consideration the guiding principles when designing policies and programmes; 4. Requests the Independent Expert to develop a commentary to the guiding principles, by inviting comments from States, international financial institutions, regional economic commissions, civil society organizations, the private sector and individuals; 5. Welcomes the holding of the most recent expert meetings, in November 2011 and February 2012, to review a new of the guiding principles prepared by the Independent Expert, and the active participation and contributions of several stakeholders, ! A/HRC/20/23. A/HRC/20/L.17 including States, international financial institutions, regional economic commissions, civil society organizations and individuals; 6. Recalls that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 7. Recognizes that structural-adjustment reform programmes and_ policy conditionalities limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 8. Reaffirms the fact that responses to the global financial and economic crises should not result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop debt relief measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human rights in affected countries; 9. Expresses its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long- term debt burden; 10. Reiterates its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the above-mentioned Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 11. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of low- and middle-income heavily indebted countries, and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, and by armed conflicts; 12. Affirms that, from a human rights perspective, the settlement of excessive vulture funds has a direct negative effect on the capacity of Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights; 13. Also affirms that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of the problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the current system, and calls upon States to take measures to combat those vulture funds; 14. Acknowledges that, in least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 15. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that A/HRC/20/L.17 debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 16. Recalls once again the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 17. Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 18. Recalls the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt- servicing burdens of developing countries; 19. Stresses the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of broader social development goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of human rights; 20. Also stresses that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights; 21. Further stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 22. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting ongoing programmes; 23. Calls upon creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and debtors alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to development projects, loan agreements or Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers; A/HRC/20/L.17 24. Reaffirms the fact that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 25. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 26. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 27. Also reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 28. Requests the Independent Expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 29. Encourages the Independent Expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special rapporteurs, Independent Experts and members of the expert working groups of the Human Rights Council and its Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development in his work; 30.

Also recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, the fact that its benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs unevenly distributed represents an aspect of the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries; 7.

Recognizes that the responsible operations of transnational corporations and other business enterprises can contribute to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular economic, social and cultural rights; 11. Also recognizes that only through broad and sustained efforts, including policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all human rights; 12. Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and democratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 13. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development; 14.

Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 22.
