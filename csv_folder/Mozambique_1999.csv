Stresses that the structural adjustment policies have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Also stresses the importance of continuing to implement immediate, effective and durable actions for alleviating the burdens of debt and debt-service of the developing countries with debt problems, in the framework of the realization of economic, social and cultural rights; 3. Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 4. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from the 4. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from the foreign debt to take account of the specific characterstics, conditions and needs of the debtor countries and the need to incorporate the social dimension of development; 5. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms arising from the debt; 6. Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on the foreign debt, in particular in the debt initiative for the heavily indebted poor countries and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms, to be implemented completely and flexibly, and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives, which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis; 7. Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty, and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 8. Requests the Special Rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights to present an analytical report to the Commission, on an annual basis, on the implementation of the present resolution, paying particular attention to: (a) The negativ ffects of the foreign debt and the policies adopted to face it on the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries; (b) easures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries; 9. Regquests the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to perform his functions; 10.

Also calls upon Governments, international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily-indebted poor countries, giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters; 13. Recognizes that there is a need for more transparency in the activities of international financial institutions; 14. Considers that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem, there is a need for a political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 15.

Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and, therefore, requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international level for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be fr from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers intolerable that more than 800 million people, especially women and children, throughout the world, and particularly in developing countries, do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs, which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas; 4. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 5. Welcomes the convening of a follow-up consultation on the right to adequate food by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on 18 and 19 November 1998 as requested by the Commission in resolution 1998/23, as a concrete and practical response to objective 7.4 of the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action, in order better to define the rights relating to food in article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to propose ways to implement and realize those rights as a means of achieving the commitments of the World Food Summit; 6.

OHCHR should develop standard formats for such executive summaries for thematic and for country-specific mechanisms; (d) The executive summaries of all reports should be given the highest priority by the Languages Service and be issued in the framework of a compilation of all such executive summaries. This compilation would include a separate chapter highlighting any observations or recommendations concerning serious incidents or situations involving a failure or denial of cooperation with the Commission or its mechanisms; (e) Mechanisms could continue to orally supplement or update their annual reports to reflect any relevant developments in the period following submission of the initial report.

In these meetings, the Bureau would consider any appropriate steps it might take, or advice it might offer to concerned parties, to assist in advancing the process of implementation or follow-through on the recommendations of the mechanisms or conclusions of the Commission. These meetings could include private dialogues with representatives of concerned States; (c) At the conclusion of this annual Bureau review meeting, the Bureau would conduct a public briefing for representatives of all Commission members on any observations or conclusions it may consider appropriate to report. RECOMMENDATION 11.

RECOMMENDATION 12: (a) Reflecting the role of the Sub-Commission in assisting the Commission to address a broad range of human rights issues, it should be renamed “the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights”; (b) Reflecting the proposed sharpening of the Sub-Commission's role as an independent expert body focusing its attention on priorities determined by the Commission: (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to consultation with the Bureau, qualifications, to serve a four-year term, maximum of one additional four-year term. on the basis of their expert renewable for a To preserve the image of the Sub-Commission as an independent expert body, no member should be concurrently employed in the executive branch of their country's Government; (ii) The length of annual sessions of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to two weeks; (c) The Sub-Commission's work and priorities should be based on tasks entrusted to it by the Commission on Huma on the elaboration of studies, research a n Rights, with the principal focus nd expert advice at the request of the Commission. The Commission should regard the Sub-Commission's experts as i1ts foremost resource for the performa than appointing others to undertak considering the assignment of projec nce of such assignments, rather xpert research and analysis; and in ts to the Sub-Commission, the Commission might consider relevant proposals from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, from other United Nations human righ CS institutions and from the Sub-Commission itself; (d) The Sub-Commission's wor and study projects should, consistent king methods in respect of its research with th independent xpert character of (ii) the body, entail a well-prepared, thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question, any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission. This approach would preclude the need for negotiating traditional resolutions for submission to the Commission. While the Sub-Commission's deliberations should provide opportunities for interested Governments, international organizations and NGOs to provide input into this process, the experts should also be prepared to dedicate adequate time to private deliberations on their projects, inter alia in the framework of sessional working groups such as the existing working group on the administration of justice; (e) Recognizing the important opportunities the Sub-Commission and some of its subsidiary bodies play in affording a public forum for concerned parties to raise their human rights concerns: (1) The Sub-Commission should continue to conduct an annual debate on human rights violations in all parts of the world. However, rather than leading to the negotiation of resolutions, this debate should be reflected in a summary to the Commission as part of the Sub-Commission's annual report; (i1) The Sub-Commission's inter-sessional Working Groups on Minorities and on Indigenous Populations should continue to perform the valuable work they ar ngaged in, the latter until such time as the question of its future status is resolved in the context of the Commission's deliberations on a permanent forum for indigenous people in the United Nations system. The question of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery is addressed in recommendation 1 above; (f) As regards transitional arrangements associated with these proposed changes, the Bureau recommends that the Commission devise a transitional process aimed at bringing the recommended reforms fully into effect for the fifty-second session of the Sub-Commission in the year 2000. RECOMMENDATION 13: (a) Before referring any matter to a working group, the Commission on Human Rights should, where the needed groundwork has not been otherwise laid, request the Sub-Commission to undertake a study on the question at hand and (ii) prepare a text of the instrument envisaged. Among the issues to be addressed in any such study, and in the Commission's deliberations on whether to proceed, careful consideration should be given to the purposes of any ing exercise and to the guidelines set out in General Assembly resolution 41/120; (b) In creating any standard-setting working group, the Commission should consider and agree on a specific time-frame within which the group would be called upon to complete its task. This could vary depending on the complexity of the issue and the nature of the instrument (e.g. a procedural protocol might reasonably be completed within two or three years), but in any event the established time-frame should not exceed five years. If, by the end of its mandate, the working group has not been able to achieve a result, the Commission should set a period of reflection (such as one or two years) before any extension is provided; (c) Regarding the question of concluding a standard-setting exercise with or without a vote, it should be borne in mind that there is no rule of procedure requiring the Commission on Human Rights, ECOSOC or the General Assembly to adopt standard-setting instruments by consensus, and there are indeed examples where consensus has not been achieved. O0Of course, all efforts should be made at reaching consensus; (d) Finally, all working group chairs (whose terms should be linked with that of the working group) should have standing authority to undertake, between working group meetings, informal contacts and consultations with a view to advancing progress in respect of the working group's mandate. Results of such consultations should be communicated to concerned delegations on a timely basis and at the start of each session.",04/23/1999,1999_1489910,Mozambique,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council. 1503 procedure be amended in the following ways: 15 members, nominated by the Chair of the Commission in",yes

The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the immutable values of peace, democracy and the rule of law, of human rights, development and social justice, and bearing in mind the sovereign equality of States, the non-interference in their internal affairs and the respect for their territorial integrity. The Heads of State and Government of the seven Portuguese-speaking countries, faithfully interpreting the vocation and the will of their peoples, considered it imperative to: — Consolidate the national and multinational cultural reality that confers upon the Portuguese-speaking countries an identity of their own, while reflecting the special character of their relationship and the experience of a fruitful concerted action and cooperation that has been built up over the years; — Enhance a progressive international assertion of the Portuguese-speaking countries as a whole, which, although geographically separated, are identified by their common language; — Reaffirm the commitment to strengthen their ties of solidarity and cooperation by taking concerted initiatives designed to promote the economic and social development of their countries and to further develop the assertion and dissemination of the Portuguese language. The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries is therefore determined to achieve the following objectives, as enunciated in its constitutive declaration: — To contribute to the reinforcement of the human ties, solidarity and brotherhood among all peoples for whom the Portuguese language is one of the pillars of their specific identity and, accordingly, to promote ways and means to facilitate the movement of the citizens of member countries within the Community area; — To encourage the dissemination and enrichment of the Portuguese language by further developing and strengthening the institutions that have been or will be established for that purpose, in particular the International Portuguese Language Institute; — To enhance the cultural exchange and the dissemination of the intellectual and artistic creation within the framework of the Portuguese language by making use of all means of communication and of the internal cooperation mechanisms; — To endeavour to establish in certain member countries concrete forms of cooperation between the Portuguese language and other national languages in the fields of research and enhancement; — To widen the cooperation among the member countries in the field of political and diplomatic concerted action, particularly within the framework of international A/54/232 organizations, so as to give an ever greater expression to their common interests and needs within the international community; — To encourage the development of parliamentary cooperation among the member countries; — To develop the economic and entrepreneurial cooperation among the member countries and to enhance the existing potential by drawing up and implementing projects of common interest, exploring, to this end, the various forms of bilateral, trilateral and multilateral cooperation; — To give a new impetus to and to intensify the cooperation in the academic field, as well as in vocational training and in the various sectors of scientific research and technology, aiming at a growing enhancement of their human and natural resources, and to promote and reinforce the training policies of officials; — To mobilize internal and external efforts and resources aimed at assisting in the reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes, as well as in the humanitarian aid and emergency actions for the member countries; — To promote the coordination of the activities of the various public agencies and private bodies, economic associations and non-governmental organizations that are engaged in the development of the cooperation among the member countries; — To promote, in regard to the international commitments undertaken by member countries, measures designed to overcome the problems faced by the immigrant communities in the member countries, as well as to coordinate and foster cooperation in the field of immigrant policies; — To encourage bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the aim of protecting and preserving the environment in the member countries and achieving sustainable development; — To promote cooperative action between member countries and multilateral coordination with a view to ensuring full respect for human rights, both in member countries and all over the world; — To promote measures, particularly in the pedagogical and judicial fields, with a view to eradicating racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia; — To promote and foster measures designed to effectively improve the living conditions of'the child and to ensure his/her harmonious development, in the light of the principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; — To promote the implementation of specific projects of cooperation, with a view to strengthening the social condition of women, thereby recognizing the crucial role they perform for the well-being and development of society; — To foster and promote exchanges of young people, for training and the exchange of experiences, by implementing specific programmes, particularly in the fields of education, culture and sports. The Statutes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries summarize the above in three general objectives: concerted action among its members at both the political and diplomatic level, particularly with the aim of asserting their presence in the international forums; cooperation, particularly in the economic, social, cultural, legal and scientific spheres; implementation of projects designed to promote and disseminate the Portuguese language. A/54/232 In order to carry out its tasks, the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries has the following organs: — The Conference of Heads of State and Government, the highest organ of the Community, which meets every two years, electing the Executive Secretary and Deputy Executive Secretary; — The Council of Ministers, consisting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and External Relations of the seven member States, which meets once a year, coordinating the activities of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and approving the budget; — The Standing Committee for Consultation, consisting of one representative from each of the member States, which meets once a month, monitoring observance by the Executive Secretariat of the decisions and recommendations from the Conference and the Council of Ministers; — The Executive Secretariat, which is the central executive body of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, implementing the decisions of the other organs, drawing up the programmes of the Community and satisfying itself that they are implemented. The Executive Secretary, assisted by a Deputy Executive Secretary, both elected to hold office, in rotation, for a term of two years, which may be extended for one further term of two years only. Its headquarters are located in Lisbon. Decisions of the organs and institutions of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries are taken by consensus by all member States. The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries has set up a Special Fund, aimed exclusively at providing financial support for practical activities undertaken within the Community. The Special Fund is financed by public or private contributions provided on a voluntary basis. The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries is above all an institutionalized and permanent forum for dialogue and cooperation among the member States, dialogue that involves not only the States and the public bodies, but also the civil societies. In fact, since the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted, it has increasingly mobilized cooperation among the public administrations of the member countries, in their various sectors, as well as among the courts, the parliaments and several entities representing professions and other sectors of the lusophone civil societies, which have set up a series of meetings and initiatives that take place on a regular basis. Cooperation with other international organizations also constitutes a major concern of the Community. There have been mutual steps towards closer cooperation taken by the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and several international organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the International Organization for Migration, which admitted the Community as an observer, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Intellectual Property Organization. At the political and diplomatic level, the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries has enhanced extensive and permanent contacts among the seven lusophone countries, aimed at an effective and coherent approach in the international arena. Questions such as the war in Angola, East Timor and the recent crisis of Guinea-Bissau were the context of interventions by the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, guided by the international imperatives of peace, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. A/54/232 Bearing in mind the historical, linguistic and cultural ties that have bound East Timor to the members of the Community for hundreds of years, the last Conference of Heads of State and Government, held in Praia, in July 1998, approved observer status for East Timor in the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and conceded to the territory the status of invited observer in the Community, while its representatives participated in the Conference in that capacity. In Guinea-Bissau, the results of the concerted action between the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries and the Economic Community of West African States made possible the re-establishment of the peace in that country, a fact which has been internationally acknowledged, in particular by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his welcoming statement of 27 August 1998. Following its contribution to the resolution of the crisis in Guinea-Bissau, the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries is participating in the Programme of National Reconciliation and rebuilding of Guinea-Bissau, launched by the Government of National Unity, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and, in this context, has already taken part in the preparatory round table promoted by UNDP in Geneva, in May 1999, with a view to responding to the more urgent needs of the people of Guinea- Bissau. In order to pursue with an ever greater efficiency, the above-mentioned objectives and activities of common endeavour, particularly with a view to enhancing the cooperation between both organizations, as well as with the various agencies of the United Nations system, the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries considers that the status of observer in the United Nations General Assembly would be extremely beneficial to the organization. Consequently, the Standing Committee for Consultation of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, acting in accordance with the decisions taken at the meeting of the Council of Ministers, held in Praia, in July 1998, asked that the necessary steps be taken in order that the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries be granted observer status in the General Assembly. A/54/232 Annex I1 [Original: English] Draft resolution Observer status for the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Bearing in mind that the purposes of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, as enunciated in its constitutive declaration, are consistent with those of the United Nations, Considering that, accordingly, it is mutually advantageous to provide for cooperation between the United Nations and the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, Taking note of the desire of the Community for the establishment of that cooperation, 1. Decides to invite the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries to participate in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly in the capacity of observer; 2.
