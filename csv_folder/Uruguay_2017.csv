The memorandum is divided into three sections, each of which outlines why the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands constitutes an intergovernmental organization whose activities cover matters of interest to the General Assembly (the two criteria for accreditation as a Permanent Observer are stipulated in General Assembly decision 49/426 of 9 December 1994). Accordingly, these sections are as follows: 1. ‘Introduction and background 2. Status as an intergovernmental organization 3. Ramsar Convention and matters of interest to the General Assembly 1. Introduction and background Constitution: The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (herein referred to as the “Ramsar Convention on Wetlands”) was concluded at Ramsar, Islamic Republic of Iran, on 2 February 1971. Its purpose, as stated in the preamble, is “to stem the progressive encroachment on and loss of wetlands now and in the future”. In accordance with its article 10, the Convention entered into force on 21 December 1975, four months after seven States had become Parties to the Convention. The Convention has been amended twice: by a Protocol of 3 December 1982; and by the adoption of amendments on 28 May 1987. Depositary: The Depositary of the Convention on Wetlands is the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which registered the Convention at the United Nations on 17 February 1976 (registration number 14583). Bodies of the Convention: Article 6 of the Convention on Wetlands establishes a Conference of the Contracting Parties to review and promote the implementation of the Convention. Article 8 provides that the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) shall perform the Bureau duties under the Convention until such time as another organization or government is appointed by a majority of two-thirds of all Contracting Parties. Through adoption of a resolution* at its fourth meeting (Montreux, Switzerland, 1990), the Conference of the Parties established a “Convention Bureau” “co-located with the headquarters of IUCN, an independent “ See annex to document Doc. C.4.15 (Rev.). 1990. 2/7 A/72/194 unit which is funded from the Convention budget and which performs all tasks required by the Conference of the Contracting Parties”. By the adoption of resolution IX.10 at its ninth meeting (Kampala, Uganda, 2005), the Conference of the Contracting Parties decided that in its external relations the Bureau could use the term “the Ramsar Secretariat”. Resolution 3.3, adopted by the Conference of the Contracting Parties at its third meeting (Regina, Canada, 1987), established a Standing Committee of the Conference of the Contracting Parties, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Convention and the work of the Secretariat between meetings of the Conference of the Parties. Its terms of reference have occasionally been amended by the Conference. Vision and mission: The Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, at its twelfth meeting (Punta del Este, Uruguay, 2015), adopted a strategic plan for the Convention, establishing that: The vision of the Convention is: “Wetlands are conserved, wisely used, restored and their benefits are recognized and valued by all”; and The mission of the Convention is: “The conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world.” 2. Status as an intergovernmental organization The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is an intergovernmental treaty that promotes the wise use of wetlands, in particular wetlands of international importance. It currently has 169 Contracting Parties. As noted above, article 8 of the Convention provides for IUCN to perform Bureau duties “until such time as another organization or government is appointed ...”. [UCN continued in this role until a resolution was adopted at the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties establishing an independent Bureau (hereafter referred to as the Secretariat) charged with providing the Conference of the Contracting Parties with administrative, scientific and technical support. That resolution further provided that the Secretariat would comprise a Secretary-General and other staff. In relevance to which, the resolution made the Secretary-General responsible to the Conference of the Contracting Parties and, between meetings of the Conference of the Contracting Parties, to the Standing Committee (see above) for all matters under the Convention (including the administration of the Convention budget), other than those requiring the exercise of legal personality. Such matters would continue to be performed on the Convention’s behalf by IUCN. Over time, the Conference of the Contracting Parties and the Standing Committee have charged the Secretariat with increasing responsibility. As a consequence of its expanding functions, a Delegation of Authority to the Secretary- General of the Secretariat was signed in 1993 between the Chair of the Standing Committee and the Director-General of IUCN. The Delegation, which remains in force, authorizes the Secretary-General to, inter alia: enter into contracts; receive and expend Convention funds; administer a separate bank account; hire, dismiss and manage staff; and manage its facility. Today, the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands employs 24 permanent staff, including specialist advisers serving the Convention regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, North America, and Oceania) charged with liaising with Contracting Parties from each of those regions 3/7 A/72/194 and undertaking, as directed by the Conference of the Contracting Parties and the Standing Committee, regionally specific work and activities. The Secretariat of the Convention has, on behalf of the Convention, entered into formal memorandums of understanding or other forms of cooperative agreements with more than 50 entities, including government ministries, intergovernmental bodies (including other multilateral environmental agreements), non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and private sector companies. The Secretariat is required to administer funding programmes established to support the implementation of the Convention and is, together with Contracting Parties, responsible for implementing the Ramsar Convention Strategic Plan. The Secretariat is also responsible for maintaining the list of Wetlands of International Importance, as well as the “Montreux Record” of listed wetlands that are at risk of experiencing a change in ecological character.” The aforementioned powers and activities of the Secretariat imply that it has international legal personality. The structure, functions and activities of the Secretariat also evidence that it possesses the features of an organization, responsible for its actions to the 169 Contracting Parties to the Convention. It is our proposal that a Secretariat with international legal personality and directed by a cohort of States to assist in the implementation of a Convention may itself be characterized as an intergovernmental (or international) organization.“ That the treaty is intergovernmental is self-evident. In advancing this argument, we note that intergovernmental organizations (that are clearly accepted as such) often function in a similar manner to the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (and possibly with less autonomy). That is, while these organizations often possess a legal personality that is separate from their member States, “they have few, if any, powers of independent action, and progress in the development of policy and law depends entirely on the willingness of member states to propose, to adopt and to implement whatever is agreed”.‘ We further note that the definition or conception of an intergovernmental or international organization continues to evolve, as reflected by legal scholarship on the subject.° Finally, we note that the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention of Wetlands has itself been characterized by other entities as an international organization. For example, the “List of accredited intergovernmental organizations that can participate in the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14” includes the Secretariat of the Convention on Wetlands among the “Intergovernmental Organizations accredited as Observers to the World Summit on Sustainable Development” (at number 154).' The Secretariat is > Article 3.2 of the Convention requires each Contracting Party to inform the Secretariat if the ° ecological character of any wetland in its territory and included in the List has changed, is changing or is likely to change as the result of technological developments, pollution or other human interference. We note that article 2 (1) (i) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) defines “international organization” as an “intergovernmental organization”. That is, for the purposes of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the two terms are interchangeable. ° Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2002.

Ramsar Convention and matters of interest to the General Assembly There is a clear nexus between the objectives of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which promotes the wise use of wetlands,” and the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the General Assembly.' Specifically, conservation of wetlands contributes to a number of the Goals, in particular: Goal 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture); Goal 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all); Goal 13 (Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts); Goal 14 (Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources); Goal 15 (Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss). The Ramsar Convention has a long history of promoting the relationship between wetlands and sustainable development. For example: ¢ The Ramsar Strategic Plan 2003-2008 adopted at the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties (Valencia, Spain, 2002) highlighted the explicit links between the sustainable use of wetlands and the health and well- being of human beings.! The “Changwon Declaration on human well-being and wetlands” was adopted at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Changwon, Republic of Korea, 2008)‘ in recognition of the “contribution of wetlands to human well- being, livelihoods and human health ...”. The Declaration itself noted that wetlands “provide food, store carbon, regulate the water flows, store energy, and are crucial for biodiversity. Their benefits to people are essential for the future security of humankind. Conservation and the wise use of wetlands are vital for people, especially the poor”. At the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Bucharest, Romania, 2012), the Contracting Parties adopted resolution XI.21, entitled “Wetlands and sustainable development”, which calls on Contracting Parties to disseminate and promote the Tehran Declaration on Wetlands and Sustainable Development, which, inter alia, acknowledged the “vital role of wetlands in sustainable development and in achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015”. © Available online: https://www.uia.org/s/or/en/1100067521 (accessed 11 August 2017). “Wise use” is defined as “the maintenance of their ecological character, achieved through the implementation of ecosystem approaches, within the context of sustainable development”.

' General Assembly resolution 70/1. } Resolution VIII.25. > 5/7 A/72/194 ¢ The Ramsar Strategic Plan 2016-2024 adopted at the twelfth meeting of the 2th Conference of the Parties' focused on the links between the wise use of wetlands and attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. ¢On 21 June 2017, the Secretary-General of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands delivered an executive briefing entitled “The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands towards the Sustainable Development Goals” to the Permanent Missions of Member States at the United Nations Office at Geneva. The briefing was attended by representatives of 48 countries and seven organizations, and was chaired by the Chief of the Political Affairs and Partnerships Section at the United Nations, who noted the political and economic importance of wetlands, the central role played by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in their protection and in advancing the sustainable development agenda. Finally, it is worth noting that 2,280 wetlands spread across 220,453,845 hectares have been designated under the Ramsar Convention. A_ significant proportion of these sites are located in nations and regions suffering from extreme poverty, inadequate food security and poor water sanitation. Furthermore, many of these nations and regions are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Sustainable management of wetlands can assist to alleviate these issues and in turn to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.

Historical background The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was created to provide funding to developing countries for projects that achieve global environmental benefits. In the 1980s, as the realization set in that environmental damage was truly global in nature, the international community responded with the negotiation of the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Biodiversity and Agenda 21, which was proclaimed at the first United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro. In this context, many ideas were discussed on new sources of funding for the activities necessary to address environmental degradation. In September 1989, France proposed that the World Bank be provided with additional resources to fund environmental projects, offering to support it with a contribution of 900 million French francs over a three-year period. Its proposal was quickly seconded by Germany. And little more than a year later, in November 1990, 27 countries, including nine developing ones, agreed to set up a pilot Global Environment Facility (GEF). The World Bank acted as both trustee and administrator; the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) developed most of the capacity-building proposals; and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) concentrated on strategic planning and issues concerning science and technology. It was a remarkable blend of United Nations and Bretton Woods institutions. At the first participants meeting, in December 1991, developing countries stressed the need for universal membership of GEF and democratic decision- making, and the donors agreed. In the final weeks before the Earth Summit in Rio opened, the negotiators of the climate and biodiversity conventions agreed that GEF should be designated as the operator of their agreements’ financial mechanisms, on the basis that it would be restructured and its membership made universal. Almost three years of intensive talks followed in Abidjan, Rome, Beijing, Washington, D.C., Paris and Cartagena. Negotiations to restructure the Global Environment Facility concluded at a GEF participants meeting in Geneva in March 1994, with the acceptance by representatives of 73 States of the Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured Global Environment Facility. The Instrument was formally adopted, in accordance with its paragraph 1, by the three implementing agencies of GEF: UNDP, UNEP and the World Bank. The Instrument became effective on 7 July 1994. The Global Environment Facility currently has 183 participant countries (see www.thegef.org/country) and supports projects and programmes in five focal areas: climate change, biological diversity, land degradation, international waters and chemicals and waste. GEF serves as a financial mechanism for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and the Minamata Convention on Mercury. While not formally linked to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, GEF provides support to its work in countries with economies in transition. GEF works as a partnership with 18 implementing partner agencies, including United Nations organizations, multilateral development banks, 2/7 A/72/195 and major civil society organizations. It works closely with civil society organizations represented though the GEF civil society organization network. GEF has a special programme to support community-based organizations called the GEF Small Grants Programme. GEF also supports activities involving the private sector, in particular through its non-grant instrument. II. Purpose and function Pursuant to article 2 of the Instrument, “The GEF shall operate ... as a mechanism for international cooperation for the purpose of providing new and additional grant and concessional funding to meet the agreed incremental costs of measures to achieve agreed global environmental benefits”. For this purpose, the GEF trust fund has been replenished six times. In its 25-year history, GEF has invested $16 billion directly, and leveraged $90 billion in additional resources, for over 4,000 projects in 167 countries. GEF is the largest public funder of actions to protect the global environment. Climate change In climate change mitigation, over 1,000 projects target a vast range of sectors: from technology transfer, energy efficiency, renewable energy and transport to land use, land-use change and forestry. Together, GEF investments have supported more than 50 low-emission technologies, and directly helped to reduce 2.7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The Global Environment Facility is a mechanism for adaptation to climate change, managing two funds under the Framework Convention on Climate Change for that purpose: the least developed countries fund and the special climate change fund. GEF has approved over $1 billion through the least developed countries fund for adaptation projects and programmes, as well as activities to help countries to lay the foundation for adaptation. It has financed the preparation of 51 national adaptation programmes of action. Through the special climate change fund, GEF has provided over $300 million for adaptation projects, mobilizing another $2.3 billion from other partners. GEF climate change adaptation projects have helped to reduce the vulnerability of more than 17 million people in 129 countries around the world. The 2016 Paris Agreement mandated GEF to lead the capacity-building initiative on transparency that helps countries to comply with their commitments under article 13 of that Agreement. Over $50 million have been raised for this purpose and over 10 projects are currently under way. Activities include strengthening national institutions for transparency-related activities in line with national priorities; providing relevant tools, training and assistance for meeting the provisions stipulated in article 13 of the Agreement; and assisting in the improvement of transparency over time. Biological diversity The Global Environment Facility has invested over $4.5 billion to conserve and sustainably use global biodiversity. This investment has leveraged over $12 billion in additional funds, supporting 1,300 projects in more than 155 countries. As the largest funding mechanism for protected areas worldwide, GEF has invested in over 3,300 protected areas, covering more than 860 million ha, an area larger than the size of Brazil. GEF has also provided biodiversity protection and planning for more than 350 million ha of productive landscapes and seascapes. In addition, GEF has supported the development of national biosafety frameworks 3/7 A/72/195 in 126 countries, and their subsequent implementation under the Cartagena Protocol. Mainstreaming ecosystem services has been a focus of many GEF projects. Land degradation Since 2006, when land degradation became a dedicated GEF focal area, GEF has provided $876 million in resources for 190 projects and programmes with a specific focus on supporting sustainable land management to combat desertification and deforestation, creating multiple benefits for the global environment in production landscapes. The land degradation focal area projects and programmes have targeted 281 million ha of agro-ecosystems globally. Based on the implementation reports of ongoing projects and programmes, 103 million ha are under sustainable land management. These have benefited more than 50 million smallholders through various activities such as inputs into their farming systems, improvement of irrigation structures, training and capacity-building, and alternative livelihood opportunities. The GEF investment has leveraged almost $3 billion from partners. These funds have helped to hold the line against global land degradation, while simultaneously improving the livelihood base of millions of rural people who rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Chemicals and waste The Global Environment Facility has adopted an integrated approach to chemicals and waste that combines persistent organic pollutants, ozone-depleting substances, mercury and the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management in a single focal area. This approach maximizes cross-cutting global environmental benefits, while continuing to support the individual chemical conventions. Since the adoption of the Stockholm Convention in 2001, GEF has committed $1 billion dollars to projects concerning persistent organic pollutants. Additional funds invested by partners in the public and private sectors have brought the total value of the portfolio to more than $3 billion dollars. These investments help dispose of PCBs and obsolete pesticides, including DDT. They also reduce both persistent organic pollutants unintentionally generated by industrialized countries and those produced in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. GEF has invested $200 million to help 18 countries with economies in transition to meet the phase-out targets of the Montreal Protocol for ozone-depleting substances. National and bilateral partners contributed an additional $211 million to these projects, which have transferred new technologies, enhanced recycling operations and provided training to reduce the use of ozone-depleting substances. With GEF support, consumption and production of chlorofluorocarbons have been eliminated and work continues on addressing other ozone-depleting substances such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Since 2010, GEF has committed $47 million to mercury projects. These range from Minamata initial assessments, development and capacity-building to health- care waste management, life cycle management of mercury-containing products and waste, and artisanal small-scale gold mining. International waters The Global Environment Facility is a significant global funder of multi-country collaborations on shared water systems, including both freshwater and oceans. Projects support 34 transboundary river basins in 73 countries, 12 transboundary lakes, 8 transboundary groundwater basins and 23 of Earth’s 64 large marine ecosystems, shared by developing countries working together to manage their transboundary water resources. More than $1.8 billion has been invested directly, leveraging $11 billion in additional funds for over 230 projects in 170 countries. 4/7 A/72/195 Ill. Governance bodies The governance structure of the Global Environment Facility consists of the Assembly, the Council, the secretariat and the Independent Evaluation Office. It also has a Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel. Their functions are as follows: Assembly The Assembly consists of representatives of all participants and meets every four years. The Assembly reviews the general policies of the Facility; reviews and evaluates the operation of the Facility on the basis of reports submitted by the Council; keeps under review the membership of the Facility; and considers, for approval by consensus, amendments to the Instrument on the basis of recommendations by the Council. Council The Council consists of 32 members, and an equal number of alternate members representing constituency groupings formulated and distributed, taking into account the need for balanced and equitable representation of all participants and giving due weight to the funding efforts of all donors. It has 16 members from developing countries, 14 members from developed countries and 2 members from the countries of central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The Council meets twice a year. The Council keeps under review the operation of the Facility with respect to its purposes, scope and objectives; ensures that GEF policies, programmes, operational strategies and projects are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis; reviews and approves the work programme, monitors and evaluates progress in the implementation of the work programme and provides related guidance; directs the utilization of GEF funds, reviews the availability of resources from the GEF trust fund and cooperates with the trustee to mobilize financial resources; approves and periodically reviews operational modalities for the Facility, including operational strategies and directives for project selection, means to facilitate arrangements for project preparation and execution, additional eligibility and other financing criteria, procedural steps to be included in the project cycle, and the mandate, composition and role of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel; acts as the focal point for the purpose of relations with the Conferences of the Parties to the Conventions; ensures that GEF-financed activities relating to the Conventions conform with the policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria decided by the Conference of the Parties for the purposes of the convention concerned; appoints the Chief Executive Officer, oversees the work of the secretariat, and assigns specific tasks and responsibilities to the secretariat; reviews and approves the administrative budget of GEF and arranges for periodic financial and performance audits; and exercises such other operational functions as may be appropriate to fulfil the purposes of the Facility. Secretariat The secretariat shall service and report to the Assembly and the Council. The secretariat implements the decisions of the Assembly and the Council; coordinates the formulation and oversees the implementation of programme activities pursuant to the work programme, ensuring liaison with other bodies as required; ensures the implementation of the operational policies adopted by the Council through the preparation of common guidelines on the project cycle, monitoring of project implementation and evaluation of project results; coordinates with the secretariats 5/7 A/72/195 of other international bodies, in particular, the secretariats of the Conventions; reports to the Assembly, the Council and other institutions as directed by the Council; and provides the trustee with all relevant information to enable it to carry out its responsibilities. Independent Evaluation Office The Independent Evaluation Office is headed by a director, appointed by and reporting to the Council, whose responsibility it is to carry out independent evaluations consistent with decisions of the Council; and perform any other functions assigned by the Council. Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel The Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel is an advisory body to the Facility. It is established by UNEP, in consultation with UNDP and the World Bank and on the basis of guidelines and criteria established by the Council. UNEP provides the Panel’s secretariat and operates as the liaison between the Facility and the Panel. IV. Observer status in the General Assembly It is highly relevant for the Global Environment Facility to be accredited to participate in the meetings of the General Assembly and its subsidiary bodies as well as other international gatherings involving issues related to the GEF mandate. GEF plays a key role internationally in supporting the implementation of several United Nations global environmental conventions and the global environmental agenda in general. The participation of GEF in major international meetings involving these issues is often critical for GEF to carry out its work and mandate. In addition, GEF has the resources and the expertise to make a significant contribution to all such meetings, dialogues and decisions, by helping to shape the global policy dialogue and by supporting its implementation. For example, though not formally associated with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, all GEF projects contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015 and the co-benefits in the social and economic areas that result from GEF projects also help to achieve the relevant Sustainable Development Goals. 6/7 A/72/195 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the Global Environment Facility in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Wishing to promote cooperation between the United Nations and the Global Environment Facility, 1.

of the child, Recognizing that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing and protection of children, in the best interests of the child, and that children, for the full and harmonious development of their personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, Noting with appreciation the work to promote and protect the rights of the child carried out by all relevant organs, bodies, entities and organizations of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates, by relevant mandate holders and special procedures of the United Nations and by relevant regional organizations, where appropriate, and intergovernmental organizations, and recognizing the valuable role of national human rights institutions and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, Noting the convening of international, regional and national meetings aimed at eliminating all forms of violence against children,

Education from Attack, the WeProtect Global Alliance to combat online child sexual exploitation and the Global Alliance for Reporting Progress on Promoting Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies, Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical, in an increasingly globalized environment, as a result of the persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, fetal alcohol syndrome and inherited addictions, non-communicable diseases, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, environmental damage, climate change, natural disasters, armed conflict, foreign occupation, displacement, famine, violence, terrorism, abuse, all forms of exploitation, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, such as for purposes of child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, child sex tourism and sexual exploitation of children in travel, and trafficking in children, including for purposes of labour and sexual exploitation, organ removal and the transfer of organs of the child for profit, neglect, illiteracy, hunger, intolerance, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, gender inequality, inadequate protection and inadequate access to justice, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for, Profoundly concerned also that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of the world financial and economic crisis, poverty and inequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, recognizing its impact beyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable development, in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation of the 4/16 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence and to promote the resilience of children, their families and their communities, Profoundly concerned further that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the impacts of climate change, including persistent drought and extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and in this regard underlines the importance of the implementation of the Paris Agreement* adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Expressing deep concern that, despite the recognition of the right of the child to express her or his views freely on all matters affecting her or him, with her or his views given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, children are still seldom seriously consulted and involved in such matters owing to a variety of constraints and impediments and that the full implementation of this right has yet to be fully realized, Deeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of discrimination, exclusion, inequality and poverty, Deeply concerned also that approximately 5.6 million children under the age of 5 die each year,’ mostly

and services, early childbearing and lack of access to health determinants, such as safe drinking water and sanitation, safe and adequate food and nutrition, including breastfeeding, and that mortality remains highest among children belonging to the poorest and most marginalized communities, Recognizing that the risk of maternal mortality is highest for girls under 15 years of age and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among girls under 15 years of age in many countries, Expressing concern that children with disabilities face stigmatization, discrimination or exclusion and are disproportionately subjected to mental and physical violence and sexual abuse in all settings, including families, schools and private and public institutions, I
