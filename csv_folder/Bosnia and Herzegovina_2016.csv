Resolution 70/1. 2/7 Noting with concern that poverty, insecurity and lack of education are among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Noting with concern also that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and also that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, as well as their meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that raising awareness of the harmful consequences of child, early and forced marriage, including among men and boys, can contribute to promoting social norms that support efforts by girls and their families to end this harmful practice, Recognizing further men and boys as strategic partners and allies and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and recognizing that educational opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced 3/7 displacement, armed conflict and natural disaster and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, 1.

"" Resolution 61/295, annex. Resolution 70/1. chap I, sect. A. 2/12 violence against women and girls violates their and impairs their full enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing that domestic violence remains widespread and affects women of all social strata across the world, and the urgent need to prevent and eliminate such violence, in this connection recognizing also the continuous efforts by relevant parts of the United Nations system, such as the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund, the International Labour Organization, the International Organization for Migration and other relevant United Nations entities, agencies and programmes, and noting the endorsement by the World Health Assembly of the global plan of action to strengthen the role of the health system within a national multisectoral response to address interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls and against children, Recognizing also that domestic violence can encompass but is not limited to the following elements, which can be understood differently in different contexts: battering, sexual abuse of women and girls in the household, incest, dowry-related violence, marital rape, intimate partner violence, femicide, female infanticide, crimes committed against women and girls in the name of so-called “honour”, crimes committed in the name of passion, practices harmful to women and girls such as child, early and forced marriage, forced sterilization, forced abortion, coercive/forced use of contraception, forced pregnancy, sexual slavery and female genital mutilation, Recognizing further that violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between men and women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major impediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, the economy and political decision-making, Recognizing that women’s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and from the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, impedes the social and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed development goals, Acknowledging the need to address violence against women and girls holistically, including through the recognition of linkages between violence against women and girls and other issues, such as HIV/AIDS, poverty eradication, food security, peace and security, humanitarian assistance, education, access to justice, health and crime prevention, Recognizing the particular risk of violence faced by women and girls who suffer multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including older women, indigenous and migrant women and girls and women and girls with disabilities, and stressing the urgent need to address violence and discrimination against them, 3/12 Recognizing also that the persistence of armed conflicts in various parts of the world is a major impediment to the elimination of all forms of violence against women, and bearing in mind that armed conflict and other types of armed violence, including terrorism and hostage-taking, still persist in many parts of the world and that aggression, foreign occupation and ethnic and other types of conflicts are an ongoing reality affecting women and men in nearly every region, that States and the international community should place particular focus on the plight, and give priority attention and increased assistance to relieve the suffering of women and girls living in such situations and to ensure that, where violence is committed against them, all perpetrators of such violence are duly investigated and, as appropriate, prosecuted and punished in order to end impunity, while stressing the need to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law, Recognizing further that rape and other forms of sexual violence in armed conflict can constitute war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949'* and Additional Protocol I thereto,’” that perpetrators of such violence must be held accountable and that there must be no impunity in this regard, Acknowledging that trafficking in persons is one of the forms of transnational organized crime which exposes women and girls to violence, including domestic violence, and that concerted efforts are needed to combat it, and in this regard stressing that the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,'° as well as the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons,'’ will contribute to the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, Gravely concerned about the unprecedented number of refugees and displaced persons experiencing violence globally, including during their journey from country of origin to country of arrival, and recognizing the particular vulnerabilities of women and girls among refugees, displaced persons and migrants, and their potential exposure to discrimination and exploitation, as well as to sexual, physical, psychological and economic abuse, violence, including domestic violence, trafficking in persons and contemporary forms of slavery, Gravely concerned also that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, remains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all social strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse or impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, as such, is unacceptable, Recognizing the serious immediate and long-term implications for physical and psychological health, including sexual and reproductive health, and the effects that domestic violence against women and girls can present for individuals and families across generations, 4 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 75, Nos. 970-973. © Tbid., vol. 1125, No. 17512. '© Tbid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. ""7 Resolution 64/293. 4/12 Recognizing also the negative impact of domestic violence on women in the exercise of their economic and political rights, including through their access to employment, voting and holding public office, resulting in an impediment to women’s empowerment and economic independence, Underscoring the fact that shame, stigma, fear of reprisals and negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced household income, prevent many women and girls from leaving abusive relationships, reporting or acting as witnesses in cases of domestic violence and seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Deeply concerned about the high level of impunity with regard to gender- related killing of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the world, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to gender-related killing of women and girls, including in ending impunity for such crimes, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage places individuals, in particular girls, at risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, including domestic violence, throughout their lives and constitutes a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, while increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, and that every girl and woman at risk of or affected by child, early and forced marriage must have equal access to affordable quality services such as education, counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services, medical care and legal assistance, Reaffirming that female genital mutilation is a harmful practice and an act of violence against women and girls that impairs their human rights, constituting a serious threat to their health and well-being, including their psychological, sexual and reproductive health, increasing their vulnerability to HIV and possibly having adverse obstetric and prenatal outcomes, as well as fatal consequences for the mother and the newborn, and that the abandonment of this harmful practice can be achieved as a result of a comprehensive movement that involves all public and private stakeholders in society, including girls, boys, women and men, Emphasizing that States should continue to adopt and implement legislation and policies in accordance with their obligations under international law, and in particular in accordance with relevant international human rights obligations and with their commitments, which address the issue of violence against women and girls in a comprehensive manner, not only by criminalizing violence against women and girls, providing for the prosecution of perpetrators and holding them accountable, but also by including protection and preventive measures and access to just and effective remedies for victims and survivors, with provisions for adequate funding for their implementation, Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to 5/12 account the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, Welcoming the major contributions made by civil society, including women’s and community-based organizations, feminist groups, women human rights defenders, girls’ and youth-led organizations, national human rights institutions where they exist, religious leaders, faith-based organizations, organizations active in the family field, the private sector, employer organizations, trade unions, the media, and by men and boys, in the efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and recognizing the importance of having open, inclusive and transparent engagement with them in the gender- responsive implementation of local, national, regional and international agendas, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Stressing the need to fully engage men and boys as agents and beneficiaries of change in the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, as well as allies in the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, Recognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such violence the family can play an important role, 1. Calls upon all States to implement the commitment to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; '* 2. Stresses that “violence against women” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, including online, and notes the economic and social harm caused by such violence; 3. Recognizes that violence against women and girls is a form of discrimination that seriously inhibits their ability to enjoy human rights and fundamental freedoms and is rooted in gender inequality, deeply embedded negative social norms and stereotypes, poverty, inequality in the economic, social and cultural spheres and unequal power relations between men and women; 4. Stresses that domestic violence can take many different forms, including physical, psychological and sexual violence, economic deprivation and isolation, and neglect, and occurs within the family or domestic unit and generally between current or former partners or individuals who are related through blood or intimacy; 5. Strongly condemns all forms of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, while recognizing that it is an impediment to the 6/12 achievement of gender equality and to the full realization of their human rights, and while expressing concern that domestic violence is the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women and girls and that its consequences are long- lasting and profound and affect many areas in the lives of victims; 6. Recognizes that violence against women and girls persists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and is a major impediment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, sustainable development, peace, security and the internationally agreed development goals, in particular the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; 7. Urges States to condemn violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and reaffirms that they should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination and should pursue, by all appropriate means and without delay, a policy of eliminating violence against women as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women;* 8. Stresses that, despite the important steps taken by many countries around the world, States should continue to focus on the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, as well as on their protection, their empowerment and the provision of services, and should therefore implement laws, policies and programmes for ending all forms of violence against women and girls and monitor and rigorously evaluate their implementation and improve, where possible, their impact, accessibility and effectiveness; 9. Also stresses the importance of ensuring that, in armed conflict and post- conflict situations and in natural disaster situations, the prevention of and response to all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, are prioritized and effectively addressed, including, as appropriate, through the investigation, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators to end impunity, the removal of barriers to women’s access to justice, the establishment of complaint and reporting mechanisms and the provision of support to victims and survivors; 10. Further stresses the need to leave no one behind in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in this regard recognizes the challenges faced by refugee and migrant women and girls and the need to protect and empower them, including in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, and the need to strengthen the resilience of communities hosting refugees, and underscores the importance of development support for those communities, particularly in developing countries; 11.
