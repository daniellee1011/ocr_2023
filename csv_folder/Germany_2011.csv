A forest may consist of either closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground or open forest. Young natural stands and all plantations which have yet to reach a crown density of 10-30 per cent or tree height of 2-5 metres are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention, such as harvesting or natural causes, but which are expected to revert to forest; (b) “Afforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of land that has not been forested for a period of at least 50 years to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources; (c) “Reforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of non-forested land to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources, on land that was forested but that has been converted to non-forested land. For the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, reforestation activities will be limited to reforestation occurring on those lands that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989; eforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to d “Deforestation” is the direct h duced f forested land t non-forested land; (e) “Revegetation” is a direct human-induced activity to increase carbon stocks on sites through the establishment of vegetation that covers a minimum area of 0.05 hectares and which does not meet the above-mentioned definitions of afforestation and reforestation contained here. It includes direct human-induced activities related to emissions of greenhouse gases and/or decreases in carbon stocks on sites which have been categorized as revegetation areas and which do not meet the definition of deforestation; (f) “Forest management” is [a] [the] system of practices for stewardship and use of forest land aimed at fulfilling relevant ecological (including biological diversity), economic and social functions of the forest, and includes emissions by sources and removals by sinks; 27 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 (g) “Cropland management” is the system of practices on land on which agricultural crops are grown and on land that is set aside or temporarily not being used for crop production; (h) “Grazing land management” is the system of practices on land used for livestock production aimed at manipulating the amount and type of vegetation and livestock produced; (i) “Rewetting and drainage” is a system of practices for rewetting and draining on land with organic soil that covers a minimum area of 1 hectare. The activity applies to all lands that have been drained and/or rewetted since 1990 and that are not accounted for under any other activity as defined in this annex, where drainage is the direct human- induced lowering of the soil water table and rewetting is the direct human-induced partial or total reversal of drainage; (Gj) [“Force majeure” means, for the purposes of this decision, [an] extraordinary [occurrences,“] [event or circumstance] defined as [those occurrences whose severity was] [an event or circumstance] beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, a Party [and whose associated [total annual] greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks are a minimum of [X per cent][Y to [5] [Z] per cent] of the total national emissions included in the base year]. ] B.

Each Party included in Annex I shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of “forest” as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, apply the definition of forest selected in the first commitment period. 20. Those Parties included in Annex I that did not select a definition of forest for the first commitment period shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of “forest” as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, select a single minimum tree crown cover value of between 10 and 30 per cent, a single minimum land area value of between 0.05 and 1 hectare and a single minimum tree height value of between 2 and 5 metres. 21. For the second commitment period, and subject to other provisions in this annex, the additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and to non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the period [1 January 2013] to [31 December [YY] resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, [and forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4,] that have taken place since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink of greenhouse gases, this value shall be added to the assigned amount of that Party. Where the result of this calculation is a net source of greenhouse gas emissions, this value shall be subtracted from the assigned amount of that Party. (This paragraph may need to be revised in light of decisions on forest management.) 22. The accounting of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, shall begin with the onset of the activity or the beginning of the commitment period, whichever comes later. 23. | Once land is accounted for under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, this land must be accounted for throughout subsequent and contiguous commitment periods. 24. National inventory systems established under Article 5, paragraph 1, shall ensure that areas of land subject to land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, are identifiable, and information on these areas shall be provided by 33 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 each Party included in Annex I in their national inventories in accordance with Article 7. Such information will be reviewed in accordance with Article 8. 25. Each Party included in Annex I shall account for all changes in the following carbon pools: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, [and] soil organic carbon [and harvested wood products. With the exception of harvested wood products,] a Party may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period, if transparent and verifiable information is provided that demonstrates that the pool is not a source. 26. | [When accounting for greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, Parties included in Annex I may remove the impacts of inter-annual variability. ] 27. Emissions from harvested wood products removed from forests which are accounted for by a Party under Article 3 shall only be accounted for by that Party. Accounting shall be on the basis of the first-order decay function’? with default half-lives”? of two years for paper, 25 years for wood panels and 35 years for saw wood. Alternatively, for domestically produced and consumed harvested wood products only, a Party may use country-specific data to replace the default half-lives specified above, or to account for such products in accordance with the definitions and estimation methodologies in the most recently adopted IPCC guidelines and any subsequent clarifications agreed by the Conference of the Parties, provided that verifiable and transparent data are available. [Harvested wood products resulting from deforestation shall be accounted for on the basis of instant oxidation. ] 28. | Where carbon dioxide emissions from harvested wood products in solid waste disposal sites are separately accounted, this shall be on the basis of instantaneous oxidation. Wood harvested for energy purposes should be accounted for on the basis of instantaneous oxidation. 29. _[[Each Party shall, for the purposes of applying the definition of force majeure, select a single minimum value in the range of [Y to [5] [Z] per cent]. The selection made by the Party shall be fixed for the duration of the commitment period. The Party shall explain why and how the value was chosen. ] 30. | Where force majeure has occurred on lands subject to activities under Article 3, paragraph 3, and Article 3, paragraph 4, and provided that the requirements of paragraphs 31 and 32 below are met, Parties may exclude from the accounting, annually or at the end of the commitment period, annual emissions [above the threshold] due to the force majeure minus any removals until the end of the second commitment period on the lands affected.

The review should take place no later than by the end of May 2011 and be conducted according to the indicative timings set out in paragraphs 28 to 32 below. The Party being reviewed may interact with the review team during the review of its submission to respond to questions and provide additional information as requested by the review team. 28. The review team may seek any additional clarification from the Party no later than one week following the review. This may include technical recommendations to the Party on the construction of its reference level. The Party is to provide any required clarifications to the review team no later than five weeks following the request and may also submit a revised reference level in response to the technical recommendations of the review team. 29. The review team will prepare a report and make it available to the Party no later than eight weeks following the review. The report should include a short summary. 30. The Party will have three weeks to respond to the report of the review team. 31. If the Party does not agree with the findings in the report, in responding to the Party’s comments, the review team will seek advice from a small group of experienced reviewers to be convened by the secretariat, which will consider comparability across Parties. 59 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 32. The review team will prepare a final report within three weeks following the Party’s response and the report will be sent to the secretariat for publication on the UNFCCC website.

Annex Definitions, modalities, rules and guidelines relating to land use, land-use change and forestry activities under the Kyoto Protocol A. Definitions 1. For land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol, the following definitions shall apply [provisionally only for the second commitment period]: (a) “Forest” is a minimum area of land of 0.05-1.0 hectares, with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10-30 per cent with trees with the potential to reach a minimum height of 2-5 metres at maturity in situ. A forest may consist of either closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground or open forest. Young natural stands and all plantations 61 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 which have yet to reach a crown density of 10-30 per cent or tree height of 2-5 metres are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention such as harvesting or natural causes, but which are expected to revert to forest; (b) “Afforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of land that has not been forested for a period of at least 50 years to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources; (c) “Reforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of non-forested land to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources, on land that was forested but that has been converted to non-forested land. For the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, reforestation activities will be limited to reforestation occurring on those lands that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989; eforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to d “Deforestation” is the direct h duced f forested land t non-forested land; (e) “Revegetation” is a direct human-induced activity to increase carbon stocks on sites through the establishment of vegetation that covers a minimum area of 0.05 hectares and which does not meet the above-mentioned definitions of afforestation and reforestation. It includes direct human-induced activities related to emissions of greenhouse gases and/or decreases in carbon stocks on sites which have been categorized as revegetation areas and which do not meet the definition of deforestation; (f) “Forest management” is a system of practices for stewardship and use of forest land aimed at fulfilling relevant ecological (including biological diversity), economic and social functions of the forest, and includes emissions by sources and removals by sinks; (g) “Cropland management” is the system of practices on land on which agricultural crops are grown and on land that is set aside or temporarily not being used for crop production; (h) “Grazing land management” is the system of practices on land used for livestock production aimed at manipulating the amount and type of vegetation and livestock produced; B. Article 3, paragraph 3 2. For the purposes of Article 3, paragraph 3, eligible activities are those direct human induced afforestation and reforestation activities that meet the requirements set forth in this annex and that started on or after 1 January 1990 and before 31 December of the last year of the commitment period and for which any removal is additional to any that would have occurred in the absence of the Kyoto Protocol. 3. For the purposes of Article 3, paragraph 3, those direct human-induced deforestation activities that are consistent with the definition in this annex and that started on or after 1 January 1990 and before 31 December of the last year of the commitment period shall be accounted for. 4. For the purposes of determining the area of deforestation to come under the accounting system under Article 3, paragraph 3, each Party shall determine the forest area using the same spatial assessment unit as is used for the determination of afforestation and reforestation, but this must not be larger than 1 hectare. 62 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 5. Each Party included in Annex I shall report, in accordance with Article 7, on how harvesting or forest disturbance that is followed by the re-establishment of a forest is distinguished from deforestation. This information will be subject to review in accordance with Article 8. 6. Each Party included in Annex I shall report and account for, in accordance with Article 7, all emissions arising from the conversion of natural forests to planted forests and the conversion of primary forests to secondary forests. C. Article 3, paragraph 4 7. A Party included in Annex I may choose to account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from any or all of the following activities: revegetation, forest management, cropland management, grazing land management. 8. A Party included in Annex I wishing to account for activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, in the second commitment period shall identify, in its report to enable the establishment of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, the activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, that it elects to include in its accounting for the second commitment period.

E. General 16. Each Party included in Annex I shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of “forest” as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, apply the definition of forest selected in the first commitment period. 17. Those Parties included in Annex | that did not select a definition of forest for the first commitment period shall, for the purpose of applying the definition of “forest” as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, select a single minimum tree crown cover value of between 10 and 30 per cent, a single minimum land area value of between 0.05 and 1 hectare and a single minimum tree height value of between 2 and 5 metres. 18. For the second commitment period, and subject to other provisions in this annex, the additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the period [1 January 2013] to [31 December [YY] resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3, paragraph 3, and forest management under Article 3, paragraph 4, that have taken place since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink of greenhouse gases, this value shall be added to the assigned amount of that Party.
