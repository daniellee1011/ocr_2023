Expresses its concern that new recruitments have not been used to correct the imbalance in favour of one region and that more than half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from this same region, which accounts for more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined; 5. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (200 series staff) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100 series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series staff rules, a practice against established policies that should be discontinued; 6. Reaffirms that Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations should guide the Secretary-General in his policy for recruiting the staff of the Organization, mindful of the criteria of equitable geographical distribution; 7.

Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 13. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 14.

Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 19.

E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 Annex Recommendations of the Meeting of Experts on the Application of United Nations Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Recommendations to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 1. The application and formulation of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should continue to be accorded high priority by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. The standing agenda item on those standards and norms should be maintained and appropriate time and resources should be devoted to it. 2. Possible future United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should focus on emerging practices in crime prevention or criminal justice, in order to facilitate the development of detailed practical guidelines for use by interested States in carrying out specific tasks. 3. The Commission should establish a mechanism, such as a group of experts and/or a special rapporteur, to supplement existing procedures for undertaking periodic reviews of the application of selected standards and norms in order to ensure their promotion, as well as to make appropriate recommendations to the Commission. 4. The focus in subsequent review cycles should be on identifying difficulties that have been encountered in the application of United Nations standards and norms, in crime prevention and criminal justice, ways in which technical assistance can be used to overcome those difficulties and desirable practices in crime prevention and control. 5. The resulting data and other information should be shared in order to enhance the level and impact of technical cooperation in the world, the overall objective being to promote criminal justice reform in line with applicable United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 6. The entire review process should be guided by the need to relate it to the main programme priorities of the United Nations, as noted in the United Nations Millennium Declaration (General Assembly resolution 55/2) and the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty- first Century (Assembly resolution 55/59, annex), including strengthening the rule of law, good governance, sustainable development and the alleviation of poverty. 7. In line with the programme priorities of the United Nations, the Commission, at each of its sessions, should seek to focus on the application of a cluster of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. The Commission may wish to consider the possibility of reviewing a presentation of a particular cluster of standards and norms and their application in specific countries. Such a presentation could be prepared in cooperation with the institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network. 8. In redesigning the information-gathering mechanisms and within the limits of current programme budget resources, the Commission should examine and propose focusing the future review process on selected clusters of instruments with the most widespread potential and relevance for application in criminal justice reforms in the E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 world, in the following order of priority, bearing in mind gender as a cross-cutting issue, and grouped into clusters as follows: (a) Juvenile justice and prison reform, including alternatives to imprisonment and restorative justice; (b) The conduct of law enforcement and criminal justice practitioners, including the integrity of the judiciary; (c) Public security and crime prevention; (d) The treatment of victims and witnesses; (e) Legal, institutional and practical arrangements for international cooperation (model treaties). 9. The Commission should request donor States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental institutions to support criminal justice reforms, in accordance with the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, in countries requesting assistance. The Commission could rely on a roster of national and regional experts who could, upon request, provide technical assistance and advice on the use and application of selected standards and norms. 10. The Commission should encourage donor countries to make financial contributions to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund. Contributions should be directed towards technical cooperation projects for implementing and promoting United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, as well as organizing meetings of experts to identify priority areas for the development of future standards and norms. Recommendations to Member States and other entities 11. Each of the Member States should be encouraged to identify at least one contact person who could serve as a knowledgeable source for the analysis of the State’s response concerning the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 12. Member States should establish mechanisms and provide resources at the national level for promoting and monitoring the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 13. Focused efforts should be made to obtain the commitment of policy makers and criminal justice managers to the implementation of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 14. Member States should publish and disseminate, in their local languages, the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 15. The United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should be easily accessible and explained in understandable language. 16. Member States, financial institutions and development agencies should support projects for the implementation of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 17. Member States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and interregional, regional and national training and educational institutions should E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 vigorously promote programmes and projects that advance the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 18. National institutions and non-governmental organizations should integrate United Nations standards and norms fully in their relevant training programmes. Recommendations to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 19. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should emphasize in its organizational structure and operations the essential role of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 20. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should assist Member States, upon request, in the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice and in the development of projects. 21. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should seek to ensure that the relevant entities within the Secretariat and in the field are fully aware of the importance of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice for building and maintaining the rule of law. 22. Well-focused efforts should be undertaken to encourage officials in peacekeeping and peace-building operations and their counterparts to apply United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 23. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should identify opportunities for sharing data and other information on United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice with Governments and with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. 24. The information provided by Member States on the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should be distributed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime via the World Wide Web. 25. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should encourage financial institutions, development agencies and non-governmental organizations to expand their technical assistance programmes for improving access to justice and the rule of law. 26. The information-gathering mechanisms used by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should be reviewed in order to bring them in line with the overall programme priorities of the United Nations. The goal should be to redesign the mechanisms in a more comprehensive, consistent and operational manner, so that the collected data and other information are more relevant to those priorities. The goal should also be to enhance cooperation among respondents, both in the collection of data and in the execution of technical cooperation projects. 27. New information-gathering mechanisms should be focused on identifying difficulties encountered in application and desirable practices. The mechanisms should be based on the present United Nations priorities unless the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, to be held in 2005, identifies new priorities. E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 28. Bearing in mind the priorities, the new information-gathering mechanisms should be conceptualized and existing mechanisms reviewed along the following parameters: (a) Standards and norms related primarily to persons in custody, non- custodial sanctions and juvenile and restorative justice; (b) Standards and norms related primarily to good governance, the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of criminal justice personnel; (c) Standards and norms related primarily to crime prevention and victim issues; (d) Standards and norms related primarily to legal, institutional and practical arrangements for international cooperation. 29. Reviews of United Nations standards and norms related primarily to capital punishment should be conducted pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/57 of 28 July 1995, in which the Council recommended that the quinquennial reports of the Secretary-General should continue to cover the implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. 30. In gathering information on the above-mentioned priorities, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should also focus its efforts on practical measures that make it possible to determine their operational usefulness in restoring or maintaining law and order, with particular reference to developing countries, countries with economies in transition and post-conflict situations. 31. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should continue to explore the possibility of additional approaches and techniques in information-gathering in order to develop even more concise, simplified and cross-sectoral methods. 32. The survey instruments should be designed to be short, easy to complete and comprehensible. 33. The Secretary-General is requested to involve the regional institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network in the review and design of the information-gathering instruments and the analysis of information collected. 34. Procedures should be developed according to which the Secretary-General, in reporting on the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, would be able to utilize not only other relevant information available within the United Nations, but also the expertise of specialized agencies, relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and academic institutions. Recommendations on training 35. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should continue to develop and produce manuals, modules and tools to be used in providing training on United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, to carry out a limited number of such training courses and workshops and to coordinate such training with other United Nations entities. E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 36. A training unit should be created within the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and resources should be allocated for training and coordination functions. 37. To the maximum extent possible, the institutes in the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network should be utilized in the planning and conduct of such training activities. 38. In cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs of the Secretariat, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should develop basic training materials for peacekeeping and peace-building operations. Recommendations on technical cooperation 39. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should establish rosters of national and regional experts who would be able to provide, upon request, technical assistance and advice on the application of particular types of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. Such rosters should be developed in accordance with the different clusters of such standards and norms. 40. The advisory services of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in relation to United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should be enhanced.
