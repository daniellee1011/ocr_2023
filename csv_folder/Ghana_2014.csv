Further stresses that, despite important steps taken by many countries around the world, States should continue to focus on the prevention of violence against women and girls, as well as on their protection, their empowerment and the provision of services, and should therefore implement laws and policies for ending violence against women and girls, and monitor and rigorously evaluate the implementation of available programmes, policies and laws and improve, where possible, their impact, accessibility and effectiveness; 8/14 17.
