Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Managenﬁnt of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (“the Agreement”), Recognizing that, in accordance with the Convention, the Agreement sets forth provisions concerning the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including provisions on subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement, binding dispute settlement and the rights and obligations of States in authorizing the use of vessels flying their flags for fishing on the high seas, Noting that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (“the Codce”)']‘:j and its associated international plans of action set out principles and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices to conserve, manage and develop fisheries, including guidelines for fishing on the high seas and in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States, and on fishing gear selectivity and practices, with the aim of reducing by-catch and discards, Noting with satisfaction

improvement of knowledge and understanding of fishery status and trends is a fundamental basis for fisheries policy and management for implementing the Code, Recognizing the need to implement, as a matter of priority, the Plan of Implementation of the \ﬁ)rld Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation),~in relation to achieving sustainable fisheries, Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, mainly as a result of, inter alia, unauthorized fishing, inadequate regulatory measures and excess fishing capacity, Concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing threatens seriously to deplete populations of certain fish species and to significantly damage marine ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States, Recognizing that inadequate flag State control over fishing vessels, including those fishing for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, and insufficient monitoring, control and surveillance measures exacerbate the problem of overfishing, 2 International Fisheries Instruments with Index (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.98.V.11), sect.
