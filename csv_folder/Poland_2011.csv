Definitions 1. For land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol, the following definitions shall apply [provisionally only for the second commitment period]: (a) “Forest” is a minimum area of land of 0.05-1.0 hectares with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10-30 per cent with trees with the potential to reach a minimum height of 2-5 metres at maturity in situ. A forest may consist of either closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground or open forest. Young natural stands and all plantations which have yet to reach a crown density of 10-30 per cent or tree height of 2-5 metres are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention, such as harvesting or natural causes, but which are expected to revert to forest; (b) “Afforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of land that has not been forested for a period of at least 50 years to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources; (c) “Reforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of non-forested land to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources, on land that was forested but that has been converted to non-forested land. For the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, reforestation activities will be limited to reforestation occurring on those lands that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989; eforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to d “Deforestation” is the direct h duced f forested land t non-forested land; (e) “Revegetation” is a direct human-induced activity to increase carbon stocks on sites through the establishment of vegetation that covers a minimum area of 0.05 hectares and which does not meet the above-mentioned definitions of afforestation and reforestation contained here. It includes direct human-induced activities related to emissions of greenhouse gases and/or decreases in carbon stocks on sites which have been categorized as revegetation areas and which do not meet the definition of deforestation; (f) “Forest management” is [a] [the] system of practices for stewardship and use of forest land aimed at fulfilling relevant ecological (including biological diversity), economic and social functions of the forest, and includes emissions by sources and removals by sinks; 27 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 (g) “Cropland management” is the system of practices on land on which agricultural crops are grown and on land that is set aside or temporarily not being used for crop production; (h) “Grazing land management” is the system of practices on land used for livestock production aimed at manipulating the amount and type of vegetation and livestock produced; (i) “Rewetting and drainage” is a system of practices for rewetting and draining on land with organic soil that covers a minimum area of 1 hectare. The activity applies to all lands that have been drained and/or rewetted since 1990 and that are not accounted for under any other activity as defined in this annex, where drainage is the direct human- induced lowering of the soil water table and rewetting is the direct human-induced partial or total reversal of drainage; (Gj) [“Force majeure” means, for the purposes of this decision, [an] extraordinary [occurrences,“] [event or circumstance] defined as [those occurrences whose severity was] [an event or circumstance] beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, a Party [and whose associated [total annual] greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks are a minimum of [X per cent][Y to [5] [Z] per cent] of the total national emissions included in the base year]. ] B.

The forest management reference levels inscribed in the appendix to this annex were set 28 transparently, taking into account: (a) removals or emissions from forest management as shown in greenhouse gas inventories and relevant historical data; (b) age-class structure; (c) forest management activities already undertaken; (d) projected forest management activities under business as usual; (e) continuity with the treatment of forest management in the first commitment period; (f) the need to exclude removals from accounting in accordance with decision 16/CMP.1, paragraph 1. Points (c), (d) and (e) above were applied where relevant. The forest management reference levels also took into account the need for consistency with the provisions of paragraph 24 below [and the provisions for addressing force majeure contained in paragraphs 28 to 31 below] [by excluding emissions by sources and removals by sinks due to force majeure. ] “X per cent” refers to a percentage of the reference level. It assumes that the same value would apply to all Parties. 49 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 12 quinquies.

For land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol, the following definitions shall apply [provisionally only for the second commitment period]: (a) “Forest” is a minimum area of land of 0.05-1.0 hectares, with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10-30 per cent with trees with the potential to reach a minimum height of 2-5 metres at maturity in situ. A forest may consist of either closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground or open forest. Young natural stands and all plantations 61 FCCC/KP/AWG/2010/18/Add.1 which have yet to reach a crown density of 10-30 per cent or tree height of 2-5 metres are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention such as harvesting or natural causes, but which are expected to revert to forest; (b) “Afforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of land that has not been forested for a period of at least 50 years to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources; (c) “Reforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of non-forested land to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources, on land that was forested but that has been converted to non-forested land. For the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, reforestation activities will be limited to reforestation occurring on those lands that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989; eforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to d “Deforestation” is the direct h duced f forested land t non-forested land; (e) “Revegetation” is a direct human-induced activity to increase carbon stocks on sites through the establishment of vegetation that covers a minimum area of 0.05 hectares and which does not meet the above-mentioned definitions of afforestation and reforestation. It includes direct human-induced activities related to emissions of greenhouse gases and/or decreases in carbon stocks on sites which have been categorized as revegetation areas and which do not meet the definition of deforestation; (f) “Forest management” is a system of practices for stewardship and use of forest land aimed at fulfilling relevant ecological (including biological diversity), economic and social functions of the forest, and includes emissions by sources and removals by sinks; (g) “Cropland management” is the system of practices on land on which agricultural crops are grown and on land that is set aside or temporarily not being used for crop production; (h) “Grazing land management” is the system of practices on land used for livestock production aimed at manipulating the amount and type of vegetation and livestock produced; B. Article 3, paragraph 3 2. For the purposes of Article 3, paragraph 3, eligible activities are those direct human induced afforestation and reforestation activities that meet the requirements set forth in this annex and that started on or after 1 January 1990 and before 31 December of the last year of the commitment period and for which any removal is additional to any that would have occurred in the absence of the Kyoto Protocol. 3. For the purposes of Article 3, paragraph 3, those direct human-induced deforestation activities that are consistent with the definition in this annex and that started on or after 1 January 1990 and before 31 December of the last year of the commitment period shall be accounted for. 4.

Warsaw, 20 September 2011 A new market-based mechanism for developing countries consisting of a common core set of rules and procedures at the international level Subject: 1. The EU welcomes the opportunity to submit its views on new market-based mechanisms. 2. This submission builds on and should be considered in conjunction with our previous 3. submissions, most recently February 11, 2011"". The EU looks forward to the establishment at COP 17 in Durban of a new market-based mechanism for developing countries consisting of a common core set of rules and procedures at the international level. The EU sees it as an important part of a balanced package. The decision to be agreed in Durban should provide clear guidance on the characteristics of this mechanism, building on those captured in the Canctin Agreements’, and a clear process and timeline for the development of modalities and procedures soon thereafter. Need for coordinated approach for new market-based mechanisms 4. The new market-based mechanism is essential to ensure that global action is sufficient to stay below a 2°C increase in temperatures and to enhance the cost-effectiveness of global mitigation action. The development of such a mechanism should complement existing flexible mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. 5. A variety of new market-based mechanisms are currently being developed in a bottom-up manner irrespective of the progress of negotiations at the UNFCCC level. Such initiatives and pilot activities are useful, however they are not coordinated and could lead to market fragmentation, thereby minimising transparency and liquidity of the carbon market and increasing the risk for leakage and free-riding. Finally, the units resulting from the new market-based mechanisms need to represent real, measurable, verifiable and additional emission reductions. 6. A coordinated approach with stringent requirements has following benefits: e environmental integrity of carbon credits which represent real and additional emission reductions; e higher transparency, predictability and clarity for all market participants; e increased efficiency due to a homogeneous market with fully fungible units; e quicker enhancement of the international carbon market; ' Contained in FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/MISC.2, p. 48. ? Decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 80. 2 e attracting more private investment to a properly regulated market; e facilitates more stringent emissions caps in the future; e facilitates comparability in assessment of mitigation efforts; e more confidence for developing low carbon technologies due to a larger market. 7. Providing a coordinated approach through a new market based mechanism at the UNFCCC level is critical and should happen without delay. The implementation of this mechanism will take time. The new market-based mechanism should be established now and must not be postponed. Key principles for the new market-based mechanism 8. 11. The new market-based mechanism will need to build on the characteristics agreed in Cancun: voluntary participation, complementing other means of support for NAMAs, stimulating mitigation across broad segments of the economy, safeguarding environmental integrity, ensuring a net decrease and/or avoidance of global GHG emissions, assisting developed country Parties to meet part of their mitigation targets, ensuring good governance and robust market functioning’. The new market-based mechanism would allow for two basic forms: trading and crediting’. . The national implementation of the new market-based mechanism results in internationally tradable units representing 1 ton of CO2-equivalent. Clear rules regarding the complementary relationship between CDM and the new market- based mechanism will need to be agreed. These rules should give incentives for more emission reductions, avoid double counting of emission reductions, provide clarity to investors and ensure the continuing stability of the market. Governance framework 12. 13. 14. 15. The new market-based mechanism under the UNFCCC can accommodate different forms of implementation in host countries. The common core set of rules are to be agreed under the UNFCCC. This would include, inter alia, rules how to define sectors and coverage of gases, methods and criteria for determining baselines, crediting thresholds or sector targets, length of crediting/trading period, guidelines for monitoring, reporting and verifying emissions, accreditation of verifiers. The core set of rules needs to ensure environmental integrity of the national implementation of the new market-based mechanism. Flexibility could be retained for some more detailed design features. National arrangements in developing countries may be different, e.g. how crediting thresholds or sector target are reached, distribution of emission reduction effort within the broad segment of economy, etc. As a general rule of ownership and responsibility, the implementation shall rest with the host country, everything that can be done at the host country level, could be done there. This will provide for greater host country role in implementing the new market-based mechanism. } For elaboration of the characteristics agreed in Cancun see EU's submission of 15™ February 2011 in FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/MISC.2, p51-57. 4 See paragraphs 18-20 in EU's submission of 15"" February 2011 in FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/MISC.2, p51. 16. The national implementation of the new market-based mechanism should be facilitated by capacity building where such is needed. The EU is willing to strengthen its cooperation and support to improve carbon market readiness in developing countries. The illustrative operation cycle for new market-based mechanism A developing country prepares a proposal: - Voluntarily decides to engage in the new market-based mechanism - Chooses coverage (i.e. sectors and gases) based on common definitions - Estimates baseline emissions pathway for these sectors and gases based on methods and criteria agreed in core set of rules - Chooses a trading and/or crediting route - Determines crediting threshold or sector target based on criteria or methodology agreed in the core set of rules - Chooses the domestic actions it will undertake to reach this threshold or target - Assesses the risk of carbon leakage to sectors not covered by the threshold/target and presents any measures necessary to address it A developing country Party submits the proposal Technical assessment of the proposal (indispensable at the UNFCCC level) Assessment of baselines and crediting thresholds or sector targets Implementation Monitoring and verification of emissions Issuance of credits or units Approval of baseline and crediting threshold or sector target has the objective to ensure that units issued represent real, measurable, verifiable and additional emission reductions. New market-based mechanism in the accounting framework 17. As outlined in a separate submission”, the EU considers that establishing a rigorous, robust and transparent international accounting system is indispensable to ensure the environmental integrity of the climate regime and to secure comparability between Parties' commitments. As part of this international accounting system, one essential element is to define common rules to account for the use of market-based mechanisms. This is especially important as market-based mechanisms require specific and robust rules to 1.a. ensure their environmental robustness and avoid double counting. The proposals formulated by the EU in the present submission fully form part of this overall accounting framework. > Cf Submission on need for a rigorous, robust and transparent international accounting system. 4 Annex",N/A,Non paper” on elements for a decision on enhanced action on mitigation - 3.2.5 (markets — Ibv of the BAP) - LCA -/CP.17,"The Conference of the Parties, Recalling the decision 1/CP.16 Recognising that enhancing the cost-effectiveness of, and promoting mitigation actions requires a broad range of approaches, including market-based approaches to establish a value for emissions of greenhouse gases, Recognising that enhancing the cost-effectiveness of mitigation actions minimises the global costs of climate change mitigation to society and enables an increase in the overall ambition to reduce emissions, Emphasising the importance of contributing to sustainable development, including through technology transfer and other co-benefits, Acknowledging the mechanisms established under the Kyoto Protocol and supporting the continuation of the use of these mechanisms, 1 Decides to establish a new market-based mechanism for developing countries consisting of a common core set of rules and procedures at the international level, that complements other means of support for nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties, enhances the cost-effectiveness of mitigation and assists developed country Parties in meeting part of their mitigation commitments, while ensuring that the use of such a mechanism is supplemental to domestic mitigation efforts; Decides that the establishment of the new market-based mechanism referred to in paragraph 1 above shall be guided by the following: (a) Ensuring voluntary participation of Parties, supported by the promotion of fair and equitable access for all Parties; (b) Stimulating mitigation across broad segments of the economy, which constitute a significant proportion of a country's emissions or a significant proportion of a country's GDP, and can contain sectors or subsectors; (c) Safeguarding environmental integrity by ensuring that emission reductions and removals are additional to any that would otherwise occur, providing for robust measurement, reporting and verification, preventing the different types of double-counting, inter alia between developed and developing country mitigation, mitigation and public finance and with existing mechanisms and minimizing the risk of carbon leakage; (d) Ensuring a net decrease and/or avoidance of global greenhouse gas emissions and reflecting contributions by developing country Parties to global mitigation efforts; (e) Promoting investment by the private sector; ° The EU distributes this text as a suggestion in order to move forward the discussion in the run-up to the Durban Climate Conference.
