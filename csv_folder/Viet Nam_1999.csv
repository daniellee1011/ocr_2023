Stresses that the structural adjustment policies have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Also stresses the importance of continuing to implement immediate, effective and durable actions for alleviating the burdens of debt and debt-service of the developing countries with debt problems, in the framework of the realization of economic, social and cultural rights; 3.

Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on the foreign debt, in particular in the debt initiative for the heavily indebted poor countries and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms, to be implemented completely and flexibly, and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives, which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis; 7. Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty, and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 8.
