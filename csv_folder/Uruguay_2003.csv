international peace and security, Recognizing, therefore, that urgent action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, Recognizing also the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for urgent international action to 03-32135 (E) 110403 *0332135* prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in

simple, effective and pragmatic and that it should not impede the present legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and should

thereof, may require different approaches to meet minimum standards, Welcoming the important contribution of the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African diamond producing countries, Noting
