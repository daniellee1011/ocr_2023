That war, unprecedented in its scale and ferocity, turned into a great tragedy for the peoples of Europe, Asia and the world. A threat to the very basic principles of civilization was averted at the cost of colossal joint efforts and grave losses. Through the suffering and death of millions of people, the world community came to realize the indispensability of a system of collective security and the necessity of establishing reliable machinery to ensure international peace. The burning desire to spare humanity forever from the miseries of war inspired States to establish a reliable mechanism for maintaining international peace and security — the United Nations. The objectives set for the Organization when established are still relevant. Among them are the strengthening of an equitable world order based on the principles of humanism and mutually beneficial cooperation, the effective maintenance of international peace and security, and the promotion of sustained development in the political, socioeconomic and other spheres. Today we need to remember the lessons of the Second World War and to work to promote the preservation of the historical memory of peoples. The perception of the victory won in 1945 as a common value for all of humanity is essential for the coming together of the international community to address dangerous modern challenges and threats. The memory of the victory over fascism is also relevant in terms of preventing attempts to revise the results of the Second World War and the conclusions of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as well as in the light of the objectives of the United Nations to oppose crimes based on race, nationality and ethnic origin and the spread of ideas of intolerance and related contemporary forms of racial discrimination. It is in the direct interest of humanity to further strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as the central element in the collective security system designed to put into practice the high goal proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations — “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Consideration of this agenda item could lead to the adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Second World War. This would make it possible to hold a special solemn meeting of the General Assembly in memory of all victims of the war. 3/4 A/74/290 Annex IT Draft resolution Seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 59/26 of 22 November 2004, in which it, inter alia, declared 8 and 9 May as a time of remembrance and reconciliation, while recognizing that Member States may have individual dates of victory, liberation and commemoration, Recalling that 2020 will mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a war which brought untold sorrow to mankind, particularly in Asia and Europe, Stressing that this historic event established the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, Calling upon the States Members of the United Nations to unite their efforts in dealing with new challenges and threats, with the United Nations playing a central role, and to make every effort to settle all disputes by peaceful means in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered, Underlining the progress made since the end of the Second World War in overcoming its legacy and towards reconciliation, international and regional cooperation and the promotion of democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular through the United Nations, and the establishment of regional organizations and other appropriate frameworks, 1.
