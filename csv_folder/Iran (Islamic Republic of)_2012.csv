Please reeyele OO GE. 12-12254 A/HRC/19/L.21 Bearing in mind the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted on 13 June 2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-importing Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994, Reaffirming the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, Recalling the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food and nutrition security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food and nutrition insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis as a combination of several major factors, including speculation on food commodities and macroeconomic factors, also affected negatively by environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of development and transfer of relevant technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in particular in the said countries, Concerned by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and alarmed at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, A/HRC/19/L.21 Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, Recognizing the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including women, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Stressing the importance of reversing the substantial decline of assistance devoted to agriculture since 1980, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, while noting the recent partial inversion of this trend, Recalling the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, and the most vulnerable groups, as well as national and international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable investment in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2.

Considers it intolerable that, according to an estimation by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are undernourished is nine hundred and twenty five million worldwide, and that there is an additional one billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed twelve billion people; 5. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Recognizes the importance of smallholder farmers in developing countries, including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring food and nutrition security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their development; A/HRC/19/L.21 7. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 8. Stresses the need to guarantee fair and non-discriminatory access to land rights for smallholders, traditional farmers and their organizations, including, in particular, rural women and vulnerable groups; 9. Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to ensure the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food and nutrition insecurity to integrate and effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 10. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 11. | Encourages States to mainstream a human rights perspective in building and reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms, in order to: (a) Identify, at the earliest stage possible, emerging threats to the right to adequate food, with a view to facing them; (b) — Strengthen the overall national human rights protection system with a view to contributing to the realization of the right to food; (c) Improve coordination between the different relevant ministries and between national and subnational levels of government; (d) Improve accountability, with a clear allocation of responsibilities, and the setting of precise time frames for the realization of the dimensions of the right to food that require progressive implementation; (e) Ensure adequate participation, particularly of the most food-insecure segments of the population; (f) Pay specific attention to the need to improve the situation of the most vulnerable segments of society; 12. Underlines the significance of national government policies and strategies on food production and poverty alleviation; 13. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food and nutrition security, with a special focus on the gender-sensitive dimension; 14. Calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, paragraph 2 thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; A/HRC/19/L.21 15. Calls upon States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 16. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small- scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches, and encourages States and donors, both public and private, to examine and consider ways to integrate, where applicable and according to national contexts, the recommendations contained in the latest report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food! in policies and programmes; 17. Recognizes that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools to achieve food and nutrition security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 19. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 20. Requests all States and private actors, and international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 21.

Please reeyele OO GE. 12-14724 A/HRC/20/L.17 Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, Emphasizing that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the international community to make all efforts to help to alleviate the external debt burden of developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such countries to attain the full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights of their people, Stressing the determination expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income developing countries through various national and international measures designed to make their debt sustainable in the long term, Noting with concern that the total external debt of emerging and developing economies rose from 2,678.4 billion United States dollars in 2003 to 5,414.6 billion dollars in 2010 and is projected to rise to 6,446.3 billion dollars in 2012, and that debt service payments rose from 795.2 billion dollars in 2003 to 1,743.7 billion dollars in 2010, and were projected to rise to 2,010.8 billion and 2,265.5 billion in 2011 and 2012 respectively, Acknowledging that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people- centred sustainable development and poverty eradication and that, for many developing countries and countries with economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely constrained their capacity to promote social development and to provide basic services to create the conditions for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, Expressing its concern that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing countries continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official development assistance, Affirming that debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing developing countries, contributes to extreme poverty and is an obstacle to sustainable human development, and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 1.

Recalls that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 7. Recognizes that structural-adjustment reform programmes and_ policy conditionalities limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 8. Reaffirms the fact that responses to the global financial and economic crises should not result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop debt relief measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human rights in affected countries; 9. Expresses its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long- term debt burden; 10. Reiterates its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the above-mentioned Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 11. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of low- and middle-income heavily indebted countries, and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, and by armed conflicts; 12. Affirms that, from a human rights perspective, the settlement of excessive vulture funds has a direct negative effect on the capacity of Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights; 13. Also affirms that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of the problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the current system, and calls upon States to take measures to combat those vulture funds; 14. Acknowledges that, in least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 15. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that A/HRC/20/L.17 debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 16. Recalls once again the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 17. Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 18. Recalls the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt- servicing burdens of developing countries; 19.

Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 22.

and protect the human rights of all persons with disabilities, including all individuals with autism spectrum disorders, by, inter alia, ensuring equal opportunities to achieve their optimal developmental potential and to participate in society, Recognizing the important contribution that non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors can make in promoting human rights for persons with disabilities, including all individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), developmental disorders (DD) and associated disabilities, and their integration in societies, as well as addressing the socioeconomic needs of their families and communities, Reaffirming the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, Affirming that ensuring and promoting the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, without distinction, is critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, Recalling its resolution 66/124 of 19 December 2011, by which it decided to convene a one-day high-level meeting of the General Assembly, on 23 September 2013, with the overarching theme “The way forward: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond”, which shall be funded within existing resources, in order to strengthen efforts to ensure accessibility for and the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development efforts, Aware that autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects the functioning of the brain, characterized by impairments in social interaction, problems with verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests and activities, Aware also that the vast variety of needs of individuals with ASD, DD and associated disabilities poses a substantial challenge to addressing the disability and providing the appropriate services for treatment and care by Government and non-governmental organizations, Deeply concerned that children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities in all regions of the world experience challenges in accessing long-term health care, education, training and intervention programmes undertaken by Governments, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, Concerned also that those persons with ASD, DD and associated disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society, and reaffirming that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person, Recalling that early diagnosis, appropriate research and effective interventions are vital to the growth and development of the individual, and emphasizing that early intervention is crucial for addressing the needs of the individual with ASD, DD and associated disabilities, thus improving the opportunities to live a quality life A/67/L.33 with the ability to participate in the greater community and increasing the likelihood that an individual will need lower levels of support later in life, Recognizing that the full enjoyment by persons with ASD, DD and associated disabilities of their human rights and their full participation will result in significant advances in the social and economic development of societies and communities, Realizing that the challenge of meeting the needs of individuals with ASD,

welfare systems trying to meet their needs, Further recognizing the work of the World Health Organization in addressing ASD, DD and associated disabilities in its resolutions, notably through resolution 65.4 entitled “The global burden of mental disorders and the need for a comprehensive, coordinated response from health and social sectors at the country level”, adopted by the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, requesting the Director General of the World Health Organization to develop a comprehensive mental health action plan, for consideration by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly, ® Recognizing that a major barrier to improving the health and well-being of children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities and their families is the paucity of knowledge and expertise to recognize symptoms and identify ASD, and also recognizing that the absence of effective routine screening that allows for early detection, in turn, limits access to care and early interventions and that, without research to develop and implement effective programmes, the emergence of appropriate solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families does not occur, Acknowledging efforts to increase awareness of the rights of those affected by ASD, DD and associated disabilities, including the commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day, which led to increased international public concern for autism and other developmental disabilities, Taking note of the Dhaka Declaration on Autism Spectrum Disorders and Developmental Disabilities of 25 July 2011, 1.
