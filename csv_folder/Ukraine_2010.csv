GE.10-14411 A/HRC/14/L.9/Rev.1 Underscoring the fact that the duty of States to exercise due diligence to prevent violence against women and girls includes using all appropriate means of a legal, political, administrative and social nature that promote the protection of human rights and ensuring that acts of violence are considered and treated as illegal acts for which adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate punishment and remedies, including reparations, are available, Recognizing that power imbalances and structural inequality between men and women are among the root causes of violence against women, and that effective prevention of violence against women and girls requires action at all levels of government, the engagement of civil society, the involvement of men and boys and the adoption and implementation of multifaceted and comprehensive approaches that promote gender equality and empowerment of women, and integrate awareness, education, training, political will, legislation, accountability, targeted policies and programmes, specific measures to reduce vulnerability, data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and protection, support and redress for women who have experienced violence, Recognizing also that violence against women is one of the factors impeding progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, Recognizing further the importance of the full participation of women in the development of effective policies and programmes relating to the prevention of violence against women, Acknowledging that confronting and changing the harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women are fundamental to ensuring effective prevention, Stressing that the realization of all human rights by women and girls, such as those regarding ownership of land, property, inheritance, housing, financial services, including loans, nationality and legal capacity, education, conditions of work, access to health, economic participation, access to labour and disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political participation, access to decision-making processes, social security and cultural life, supported by interventions dealing with legal literacy, skills training and access to productive resources, is a key factor in preventing violence against women and girls, and that, in many instances, the different treatment of women before the law has resulted in the lack of equal opportunities for them in these areas, Deeply concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of some women and girls, including women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, refugee and internally displaced women, stateless women, migrant women, women living in rural or remote communities, women living in slums and informal settlements, women living in conditions of poverty, women in institutions or in detention, women with disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in all situations of armed conflict, women who face trafficking, sexual or labour exploitation, and women who are otherwise discriminated against, including on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status, Concerned that the threat or risk of being exposed to violence may constitute a barrier to women and girls realizing their right to education, Alarmed that, in situations of armed conflict, women are particularly exposed to sexual and other forms of violence, and recognizing the need to intensify efforts to prevent such violence in accordance with intemational humanitarian law and human rights law, 1.

Calls upon States to enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic legislation and take measures to enhance the protection of women and girls who have experienced violence, to criminalize such violence, to investigate, prosecute, punish and redress, including by ensuring access to adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate remedies, including reparations, the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence, whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in situations of armed conflict, to ensure that such legislation conforms with relevant intemational human rights instruments and international humanitarian law, to abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against women, and to remove gender bias in the administration of justice; 3. Also calls upon States to place a high priority on strengthening and implementing legal and policy measures that promote the full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights, particularly those aimed at eliminating discrimination against women, promoting gender equality, empowering women and promoting their full autonomy, including with regard to land, property, marriage and divorce, child custody and inheritance, and to promote equal access to literacy, education, skills training and employment opportunities, land, credit, agricultural extension, adequate housing, just and favourable conditions of work, and business and leadership skills training; 4.

Also calls upon States to support initiatives undertaken by women’s groups, intemational and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and community groups and other relevant civil society actors aimed at promoting gender A/HRC/14/L.9/Rev.1 equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls, and raising awareness of and preventing violence against women and girls; 9.

Urges States to enhance efforts to involve men and boys in initiatives to prevent violence against women and in highlighting the unacceptability of violence against women; 13. Stresses that women should be empowered to protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and calls upon States to take all necessary legislative and policy steps; 14. Calls upon States to strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacity of women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by providing HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services, to ensure protection from and prevention of stigma and discrimination, and to cooperate with United Nations bodies, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non- governmental organizations in this regard; 15. Also calls upon States to develop and implement at all levels, as required, a comprehensive and integrated strategy of prevention and prosecution of all forms of rape, and monitor the implementation of such a strategy, which should include the training of, inter alia, all relevant government and military personnel, in particular military commanders, law enforcement officials, judicial system personnel, health workers, teachers and social workers, as well as community leaders and the news media, in all appropriate aspects of the prevention and prosecution of rape and other forms of sexual violence, and of protection of and support for victims of such violence; 16.

V.10-53897 Annex Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Preamble 1. The multifaceted nature of violence against women necessitates different strategies to respond to the diverse manifestations of violence and the various settings in which it occurs, both in private and public life, whether committed in the home, the workplace, educational and training institutions, the community or society, in custody, or in situations of armed conflict and natural disaster. In the Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the importance of adopting a systematic, comprehensive, coordinated, multisectoral and sustained approach to fighting violence against women is recognized. The practical measures, strategies and activities described below can be introduced in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice to address violence against women. Except where otherwise specified, the term “women” encompasses “girl children”’. 2. Violence against women exists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace. Violence against women is rooted in historically unequal power relations between men and women. All forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and have serious immediate and long-term implications for health, including sexual and reproductive health, for example through increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and public safety, and have a negative impact on the psychological, social and economic development of individuals, families, communities and States. 3. Violence against women is often embedded in and supported by social values, cultural patterns and practices. The criminal justice system and legislators are not immune to such values and thus have not always regarded violence against women with the same seriousness as other types of violence. Therefore, it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligation with respect to its elimination and that the criminal justice system recognize violence against women as a gender-related problem and as an expression of power and inequality. 4. Violence against women is defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and reiterated in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women? to mean any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or a General Assembly resolution 48/104. ’ Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annex 1. V.10-53897 suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures build on the measures adopted by Governments in the Platform for Action, which was adopted in 1995 and subsequently reaffirmed in 2000 and 2005, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted in 1997, and relevant General Assembly resolutions, including Assembly resolutions 61/143 and 63/155, bearing in mind that some groups of women are especially exposed and vulnerable to violence. 5. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures specifically acknowledge the need for an active policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies, programmes and practices to ensure gender equality and equal and fair access to justice, as well as establishing the goal of gender balance in all areas of decision-making, including those related to the elimination of violence against women. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be applied as guidelines in a manner consistent with relevant international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,° the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4 the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,¢ the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,‘ the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime,i with a view to furthering their fair and effective implementation. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures reaffirm the commitment of States to promote gender equality and empower women with a view to meeting goal 3 of the Millennium Development Goals.i 6. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be endorsed by national legislation and implemented by Member States and other entities in a manner consistent with the right to equality before the law, while also recognizing that gender equality may sometimes require the adoption of different approaches that acknowledge the different ways in which violence affects women as compared to men. Member States should ensure that women have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice in order to facilitate efforts by Governments to prevent and sanction acts of violence against women through comprehensive and coordinated policies and strategies, and to deal with all forms of violence against women within the criminal justice system. 7. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women must be focused on the needs of victims and empower individual women who are victims of ¢ United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, No. 20378. d Tbid., vol. 1577, No. 27531. e Ibid., vol. 2171, No. 27531. f Ibid., vol. 999, No. 14668. & Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. h Tbid., vol. 2187, No. 38544. i Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. ji A/56/326, annex. V.10-53897 violence. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at ensuring that prevention and intervention efforts are made to not only stop and appropriately sanction violence against women, but also restore a sense of dignity and control to the victims of such violence. 8. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at contributing to de jure and de facto equality between women and men. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures do not give preferential treatment to women but aim at ensuring that any inequalities or forms of discrimination that women face in accessing justice, particularly in respect of acts of violence, are redressed. 9. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that sexual violence is an issue of international peace and security, as outlined in Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women and peace and security, particularly the need for parties to armed conflict to adopt prevention and protection measures in order to end sexual violence. 10. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that some special groups of women are particularly vulnerable to violence, either because of their nationality, ethnicity, religion or language, or because they belong to an indigenous group, are migrants, are stateless, are refugees, live in underdeveloped, rural or remote communities, are homeless, are in institutions or in detention, have disabilities, are elderly, are widowed or live in conflict, post-conflict and disaster situations and as such they require special attention, intervention and protection in the development of crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women. 11. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize advances in crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women and the importance of investing in the prevention of violence against women. 12. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that States have the obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, including women, and that they must exercise due diligence and take relevant measures to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women, to eliminate impunity and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of women’s human rights and fundamental freedoms. I. Guiding principles 13. Member States are urged: (a) To be guided by the overall principle that effective crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women are human rights-based, manage risk and promote victim safety and empowerment while ensuring offender accountability; (b) To develop mechanisms to ensure a comprehensive, coordinated, systematic and sustained approach for the implementation of the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures at the national, regional and international levels; V.10-53897 (c) To promote the involvement and participation of all relevant sectors of Government and civil society and other stakeholders in the implementation process; (d) To commit adequate and sustained resources and develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure their effective implementation and oversight; (e) To take into account the varying needs of women subjected to violence in the implementation of the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures.

Ii. Criminal procedure 15. Member States are urged to review, evaluate and update their criminal procedures, as appropriate and taking into account all relevant international legal instruments, in order to ensure that: (a) The police and other law enforcement agencies have, with judicial authorization where required by national law, adequate powers to enter premises and conduct arrests in cases of violence against women, and to take immediate measures to ensure the safety of victims; (b) The primary responsibility for initiating investigations and prosecutions lies with the police and prosecution authorities and does not rest with women subjected to violence, regardless of the level or form of violence; (c) Women subjected to violence are enabled to testify in criminal proceedings through adequate measures that: facilitate such testimony by protecting the privacy, identity and dignity of the women; ensure safety during legal proceedings; and avoid “secondary victimization”.« In jurisdictions where the safety of the victim cannot be guaranteed, refusing to testify should not constitute a criminal or other offence; (d) Evidentiary rules are non-discriminatory; all relevant evidence can be brought before the court; rules and principles of defence do not discriminate against women; and “honour” or “provocation” cannot be invoked by perpetrators of violence against women to escape criminal responsibility; (e) The credibility of a complainant in a sexual violence case is understood to be the same as that of a complainant in any other criminal proceeding; the introduction of the complainant’s sexual history in both civil and criminal proceedings should be prohibited where it is unrelated to the case; and no adverse inference should be drawn solely from a delay of any length between the alleged commission of a sexual offence and the reporting thereof; k “Secondary victimization” is victimization that occurs not as a direct result of a criminal act but through the inadequate response of institutions and individuals to the victim. 11 (f) People who perpetrate acts of violence against women while voluntarily under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other substances are not exempted from criminal responsibility; (g) Evidence of prior acts of violence, abuse, stalking and exploitation by the perpetrator is considered during court proceedings, in accordance with the principles of national criminal law; (h) Police and courts have the authority to issue and enforce protection and restraining or barring orders in cases of violence against women, including removal of the perpetrator from the domicile, prohibiting further contact with the victim and other affected parties, inside and outside the domicile, to issue and enforce child support and custody orders and to impose penalties for breaches of those orders. If such powers cannot be granted to the police, measures must be taken to ensure timely access to court decisions in order to ensure swift action by the court.
