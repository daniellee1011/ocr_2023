and welcoming therefore the emphasis placed by States on the topic of sanitation, for instance in General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, in which States committed to, inter alia, redouble efforts to close the sanitation gap through scaled-up ground-level action, as well as the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of Sanitation for All, pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Concerned that the official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions as a critical part of securing access to safe drinking water as well as the safe management of sanitation, Reaffirming that non-discrimination and equality are fundamental human rights principles, and concerned that inequalities in the realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation persist, inter alia, between urban and rural areas and between formal and informal areas in cities, and insisting that much remains to be done on safety, equality and non-discrimination issues, Concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including menstrual hygiene management, and the widespread stigma associated with menstruation have a negative impact on gender equality and the human rights of women and girls, Recognizing that, in realizing the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights for a rapidly growing world population, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Recalling General Assembly resolution 67/291, entitled “Sanitation for All”, in which the Assembly encouraged all Member States, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including hygiene promotion, the provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage and wastewater treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management, Affirming the need to adequately consider the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while defining concrete goals, targets and indicators, Reaffirming its encouragement to Member States to intensify global partnerships for development as a means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation, Reaffirming also the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and A/HRC/27/L.11/Rev.1 affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity; 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is essential for the full enjoyment of life and to all human rights, and recalls that it is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and is inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and human dignity; 2. Recalls that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 3. Alarmed by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign “Sustainable sanitation: the five- year drive to 2015”, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 4. Welcomes the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals proposed in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater treatment, and that special attention be given to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, and invites States to consider adequately the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; 5. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and the undertaking of country missions; 6. Also welcomes the annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the General Assembly on managing wastewater, curbing water pollution and improving water quality for the realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation,' in which she emphasized the need to ensure that respect for, protection of and fulfilment of human rights are integrated into wastewater management and to develop a holistic approach to sustainable water resource management, including to wastewater management; 7. Further welcomes the annual report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the Human Rights Council on common violations of the human rights to water and sanitation,” and encourages Governments and other stakeholders to use, as appropriate, the Handbook for realizing the human rights to water and sanitation: from policy to practice, presented in an addendum to that report,’ as a tool for the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; ' A/68/264. > A/HRC/27/55. 3 A/HRC/27/55/Add.3. A/HRC/27/L.11/Rev.1 8. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 9. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and the technical assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 10. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard, of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights; 11. Calls upon States: (a) To achieve progressively the full realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; (b) To identify patterns of failure to respect, protect or fulfil the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation for all persons without discrimination and to address their structural causes in policymaking and budgeting within a broader framework, while undertaking holistic planning aimed at achieving sustainable universal access, including in instances where the private sector, donors and non-governmental organizations are involved in service provision; (c) | To ensure that effective remedies for violations of their obligations regarding the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, including judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, are accessible to everyone without discrimination; (d) To promote access for judges, prosecutors and decision-makers to adequate human rights education and training, including on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, by, inter alia, promoting or otherwise supporting ongoing training and the inclusion of such human rights curricula in law schools and other higher education, as appropriate; (e) | To promote the ability of human rights institutions and other relevant bodies to identify violations of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, to receive complaints of violations of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and to assist with access to effective remedies for violations of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation; (f) To provide comprehensive information in their periodic reports to treaty- monitoring bodies, for the universal periodic review process and relevant regional and other mechanisms, as appropriate, for the identification, prevention and remedy of violations of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 12.
