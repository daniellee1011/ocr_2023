regional, and international cooperation and solidarity, and a coordinated, inclusive, comprehensive and global international response with the United Nations (UN) playing a key role, Recognising that armed conflicts can exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic, and that inversely the pandemic can exacerbate the adverse humanitarian impact of armed conflicts, as well as exacerbating inequalities, and expressing concern that the call for a general and immediate cessation of hostilities contained in its resolution 2532 (2020) was not fully heeded, Recalling the obligations under the International Health Regulations (2005) and applicable international law, Please recycle @ 21-02814 iEi 030321 0 A $/2021/171 Emphasising the unity, common origin and solidarity of mankind, and the need for

situations, and complex humanitarian emergencies, and taking into account the need to maintain incentives for the development of new health products, Highlighting the World Health Organisation (WHO) call that as new variants arise there should be increased scientific collaboration, transparency, exchange of information and sharing scientific knowledge including of epidemiology and genomic sequencing data, and equitable access to COVID-19 health products, and recognising in that respect the crucial role of the WHO and the importance of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), Stressing that equitable access to safe, efficacious, and affordable COVID-19 vaccines is essential to end the pandemic, noting the need to maintain incentives for the development of new health products, and highlighting the impediments to vaccination, including gaps in financing, supply, manufacturing capacity, delivery, logistics, and administration, as well as other such factors that could negatively affect vaccination efforts, in situations of armed conflict, in post-conflict situations, and complex humanitarian emergencies, Expressing concern that progress in vaccine access has been uneven and recognising that those affected by conflict and insecurity are particularly at risk of being left behind, Recognising efforts and measures proposed by the Secretary-General concerning

critical role of, and efforts made by, health workers, especially female health workers and other frontline and essential workers, including humanitarian personnel, around the world aimed at addressing the pandemic through measures to protect the health, safety, and well-being of people, Stressing further that an effective health response to the pandemic requires addressing global and country-specific operational challenges such as protection of health workers, delays in regulatory approval, supply chain management and logistics, data on the provision of health-care services, as well as private sector and community responses, and emphasising the importance of the national vaccination programmes, Highlighting the WHO call for measures to counter the spread of stigmatisation, misinformation, and disinformation, such as on COVID-19 vaccines, including through community engagement, and through civilian, police, and peacekeeping efforts in situations of armed conflict, post-conflict situations, and complex humanitarian emergencies, Welcoming the efforts of countries that have donated to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility to provide the broadest and

the efforts of Member States therein, Recognising the vital role of UN peacekeeping operations in contributing to the maintenance of international peace and security, expressing deep appreciation for the UN personnel in UN peacekeeping operations, including personnel from troop- and police-contributing countries, for their extraordinary efforts in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and its
