including those specified in Annex D and E of resolution 1737 (2006), Annex I of resolution 1747 (2007) and Annex II of this resolution, in Iran’s proliferation sensitive nuclear activities and the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems, Noting with serious concern that Iran has constructed an enrichment facility at Qom in breach of its obligations to suspend all enrichment-related activities, and that Iran failed to notify it to the IAEA until September 2009, which is inconsistent with its obligations under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its Safeguards Agreement, Also noting the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors (GOV/2009/82), which urges Iran to suspend immediately construction at Qom, and to clarify the facility’s purpose, chronology of design and construction, and calls upon Iran to confirm, as requested by the IAEA, that it has not taken a decision to construct, or authorize construction of, any other nuclear facility which has as yet not been declared to

with Article 39 of Iran’s Safeguards Agreement Code 3.1 cannot be modified nor suspended unilaterally and that the IAEA’s right to verify design information provided to it is a continuing right, which is not dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material at, a facility, Reiterating its determination to reinforce the authority of the IAEA, strongly supporting the role of the [AEA Board of Governors, and commending the IAEA for its efforts to resolve outstanding issues relating to Iran’s nuclear programme, Expressing the conviction that the suspension set out in paragraph 2 of resolution 1737 (2006) as well as full, verified Iranian compliance with the requirements set out by the IAEA Board of Governors would contribute to a diplomatic, negotiated solution that guarantees Iran’s nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful purposes, Emphasizing the importance of political and diplomatic efforts to find a negotiated solution guaranteeing that Iran’s nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes and noting in this regard the efforts of Turkey and Brazil towards an agreement with Iran on the Tehran Research Reactor that could serve as a confidence-building measure, S/2010/283 Emphasizing also, however, in the context of these efforts, the importance of Iran addressing the core issues related to its nuclear programme, Stressing that China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States are willing to take further concrete measures on exploring an overall strategy of resolving the Iranian nuclear issue through negotiation on the basis of their June 2006 proposals (S/2006/521) and their June 2008 proposals (INFCIRC/730), and noting the confirmation by these countries that once the confidence of the international community in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme is restored it will be treated in the same manner as that of any Non-Nuclear Weapon State Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Welcoming the guidance issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to assist States in implementing their financial obligations under resolutions 1737 (2006) and 1803 (2008), and recalling in particular the need to exercise vigilance over transactions involving Iranian banks, including the Central Bank of Iran, so as to prevent such transactions contributing to proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities, or to the development of nuclear weapon delivery systems, Recognizing that access to diverse, reliable energy is critical for sustainable growth and development, while noting the potential connection between Iran’s revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran’s proliferation- sensitive nuclear activities, and further noting that chemical process equipment and materials required for the petrochemical industry have much in common with those required for certain sensitive nuclear fuel cycle activities, Having regard to States’ rights and obligations relating to international trade, Recalling that the law of the sea, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982), sets out the legal framework applicable to ocean activities, Calling for the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by Iran at an early date, Determined to give effect to its decisions by adopting appropriate measures to persuade Iran to comply with resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008) and with the requirements of the IAEA, and also to constrain Iran’s development of sensitive technologies in support of its nuclear and missile programmes, until such time as the Security Council determines that the objectives of these resolutions have been met, Concerned by the proliferation risks presented by the Iranian nuclear programme and mindful of its primary responsibility under the Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and

V.10-53897 Annex Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Preamble 1. The multifaceted nature of violence against women necessitates different strategies to respond to the diverse manifestations of violence and the various settings in which it occurs, both in private and public life, whether committed in the home, the workplace, educational and training institutions, the community or society, in custody, or in situations of armed conflict and natural disaster. In the Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the importance of adopting a systematic, comprehensive, coordinated, multisectoral and sustained approach to fighting violence against women is recognized. The practical measures, strategies and activities described below can be introduced in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice to address violence against women. Except where otherwise specified, the term “women” encompasses “girl children”’. 2. Violence against women exists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace. Violence against women is rooted in historically unequal power relations between men and women. All forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and have serious immediate and long-term implications for health, including sexual and reproductive health, for example through increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and public safety, and have a negative impact on the psychological, social and economic development of individuals, families, communities and States. 3. Violence against women is often embedded in and supported by social values, cultural patterns and practices. The criminal justice system and legislators are not immune to such values and thus have not always regarded violence against women with the same seriousness as other types of violence. Therefore, it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligation with respect to its elimination and that the criminal justice system recognize violence against women as a gender-related problem and as an expression of power and inequality. 4. Violence against women is defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and reiterated in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women? to mean any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or a General Assembly resolution 48/104. ’ Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annex 1. V.10-53897 suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures build on the measures adopted by Governments in the Platform for Action, which was adopted in 1995 and subsequently reaffirmed in 2000 and 2005, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted in 1997, and relevant General Assembly resolutions, including Assembly resolutions 61/143 and 63/155, bearing in mind that some groups of women are especially exposed and vulnerable to violence. 5. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures specifically acknowledge the need for an active policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies, programmes and practices to ensure gender equality and equal and fair access to justice, as well as establishing the goal of gender balance in all areas of decision-making, including those related to the elimination of violence against women. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be applied as guidelines in a manner consistent with relevant international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,° the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4 the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,¢ the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,‘ the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime,i with a view to furthering their fair and effective implementation. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures reaffirm the commitment of States to promote gender equality and empower women with a view to meeting goal 3 of the Millennium Development Goals.i 6. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be endorsed by national legislation and implemented by Member States and other entities in a manner consistent with the right to equality before the law, while also recognizing that gender equality may sometimes require the adoption of different approaches that acknowledge the different ways in which violence affects women as compared to men. Member States should ensure that women have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice in order to facilitate efforts by Governments to prevent and sanction acts of violence against women through comprehensive and coordinated policies and strategies, and to deal with all forms of violence against women within the criminal justice system. 7. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women must be focused on the needs of victims and empower individual women who are victims of ¢ United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, No. 20378. d Tbid., vol. 1577, No. 27531. e Ibid., vol. 2171, No. 27531. f Ibid., vol. 999, No. 14668. & Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. h Tbid., vol. 2187, No. 38544. i Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. ji A/56/326, annex. V.10-53897 violence. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at ensuring that prevention and intervention efforts are made to not only stop and appropriately sanction violence against women, but also restore a sense of dignity and control to the victims of such violence. 8. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at contributing to de jure and de facto equality between women and men. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures do not give preferential treatment to women but aim at ensuring that any inequalities or forms of discrimination that women face in accessing justice, particularly in respect of acts of violence, are redressed. 9. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that sexual violence is an issue of international peace and security, as outlined in Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women and peace and security, particularly the need for parties to armed conflict to adopt prevention and protection measures in order to end sexual violence. 10. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that some special groups of women are particularly vulnerable to violence, either because of their nationality, ethnicity, religion or language, or because they belong to an indigenous group, are migrants, are stateless, are refugees, live in underdeveloped, rural or remote communities, are homeless, are in institutions or in detention, have disabilities, are elderly, are widowed or live in conflict, post-conflict and disaster situations and as such they require special attention, intervention and protection in the development of crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women. 11. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize advances in crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women and the importance of investing in the prevention of violence against women. 12. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that States have the obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, including women, and that they must exercise due diligence and take relevant measures to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women, to eliminate impunity and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of women’s human rights and fundamental freedoms. I. Guiding principles 13. Member States are urged: (a) To be guided by the overall principle that effective crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women are human rights-based, manage risk and promote victim safety and empowerment while ensuring offender accountability; (b) To develop mechanisms to ensure a comprehensive, coordinated, systematic and sustained approach for the implementation of the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures at the national, regional and international levels; V.10-53897 (c) To promote the involvement and participation of all relevant sectors of Government and civil society and other stakeholders in the implementation process; (d) To commit adequate and sustained resources and develop monitoring mechanisms to ensure their effective implementation and oversight; (e) To take into account the varying needs of women subjected to violence in the implementation of the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures.

Ii. Criminal procedure 15. Member States are urged to review, evaluate and update their criminal procedures, as appropriate and taking into account all relevant international legal instruments, in order to ensure that: (a) The police and other law enforcement agencies have, with judicial authorization where required by national law, adequate powers to enter premises and conduct arrests in cases of violence against women, and to take immediate measures to ensure the safety of victims; (b) The primary responsibility for initiating investigations and prosecutions lies with the police and prosecution authorities and does not rest with women subjected to violence, regardless of the level or form of violence; (c) Women subjected to violence are enabled to testify in criminal proceedings through adequate measures that: facilitate such testimony by protecting the privacy, identity and dignity of the women; ensure safety during legal proceedings; and avoid “secondary victimization”.« In jurisdictions where the safety of the victim cannot be guaranteed, refusing to testify should not constitute a criminal or other offence; (d) Evidentiary rules are non-discriminatory; all relevant evidence can be brought before the court; rules and principles of defence do not discriminate against women; and “honour” or “provocation” cannot be invoked by perpetrators of violence against women to escape criminal responsibility; (e) The credibility of a complainant in a sexual violence case is understood to be the same as that of a complainant in any other criminal proceeding; the introduction of the complainant’s sexual history in both civil and criminal proceedings should be prohibited where it is unrelated to the case; and no adverse inference should be drawn solely from a delay of any length between the alleged commission of a sexual offence and the reporting thereof; k “Secondary victimization” is victimization that occurs not as a direct result of a criminal act but through the inadequate response of institutions and individuals to the victim. 11 (f) People who perpetrate acts of violence against women while voluntarily under the influence of alcohol, drugs or other substances are not exempted from criminal responsibility; (g) Evidence of prior acts of violence, abuse, stalking and exploitation by the perpetrator is considered during court proceedings, in accordance with the principles of national criminal law; (h) Police and courts have the authority to issue and enforce protection and restraining or barring orders in cases of violence against women, including removal of the perpetrator from the domicile, prohibiting further contact with the victim and other affected parties, inside and outside the domicile, to issue and enforce child support and custody orders and to impose penalties for breaches of those orders. If such powers cannot be granted to the police, measures must be taken to ensure timely access to court decisions in order to ensure swift action by the court.

[Recalling decision 31/CMP.1; 2. [[The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) acknowledged that the potential impacts of response measures is a challenge faced by all countries.] [Parties noted that striving to minimize the adverse impacts of mitigation polices and measures is a common concern of both developed and developing countries.] [They further noted that any consideration of these impacts should [initially] focus on the poorest countries and those least able to address those impacts. ]] Alt: [Parties noted that striving to minimize the adverse impacts of mitigation policies and measures is an obligation of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) and a concern of developing countries and [emphasizing ][the SBI emphasized ]the commitment of Annex I Parties to minimize adverse social, environmental and economic impacts of response measures on developing country Parties, particularly those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention.] 3. [[Recognizing][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jrecognized] the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation[ and/or are faced with serious difficulties in switching to alternatives], as a consequence of action taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions. ] 4. [[Recognizing][The SBI recognized] that developing country Parties need to be given full consideration as they would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the Convention. ] 5. [[Considering][Recalling][The SBI [and the SBSTA Junderlined] the importance of the principles outlined in Article 3 of the Convention in the implementation of Article 3, paragraph 14, [and Article 2, paragraph 3, Jof the Kyoto Protocol.] 6. [Developed country Parties shall not resort to any form of unilateral measures including countervailing trade measures, against goods and services imported from developing countries on grounds of protection and stabilization of the climate. Such measures would violate the principles and provisions of the Convention, including, in particular, those related to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (Article 3, paragraph 1), to trade and climate change (Article 3, paragraph 5), and to the relationship between mitigation actions of developing countries and the provision of financial resources and technology by developed country Parties (Article 4, paragraphs 3 and 7).] Alt: [The SBI [and the SBSTA Junderlined the importance of Article 3 of the Convention in the implementation of Article 3, paragraph 14, and Article 2, paragraph 3, of the Kyoto Protocol. ] 52 FCCC/SBI/2010/10 Alt: [Parties, in the pursuit of the objective and implementation of the Convention, shall not resort to any measures, in particular unilateral fiscal or non-fiscal measures applied at the border against goods and services imported from Parties, that constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, taking into account the relevant provisions of the Convention and further recognizing the principle enshrined in Article 3, paragraph 5.] 7. [The SBI [and the SBSTA Jacknowledged the work being carried out by other bodies under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, with the aim of maintaining an approach that is coherent with other relevant work under the UNFCCC process. ] 8. [[Emphasizing][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jemphasized] that [developed country Parties [included in Annex I to the Convention]shall, in the implementation of policies and measures, strive to minimize the adverse effects, including the adverse effects of climate change, effects on international trade, and social, environmental and economic impacts on other Parties, especially developing country Parties, and in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention, taking into account its Article 3.] 9. [The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the need to deepen Parties’ understanding of adverse impacts and the need to continue to share information on the nature of impacts of response measures. Sharing of information can be achieved through the regular and systematic provision by all Parties of information that is as complete as possible on potential and observed impacts of policies and measures, in particular through [Annex I Jnational communications, and the regular review of this information.] Alt: [[Acknowledging][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted Jthe need to share information on the nature of adverse impacts of response measures experienced by developing country Parties and the steps Annex I Parties are taking, in the implementation of policies and measures under Article 2 of the Kyoto Protocol, to minimize adverse effects, especially on developing country Parties, in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention. ] Alt: [[Noting][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]]noted the importance of the exchange of information and the development of methodologies on the assessment of adverse social, environmental and economic impacts on developing country Parties, particularly those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention.] Option 1: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso noted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the adverse impacts of policies and measures, and that understanding of this could be achieved through: (a) | Assessments of potential impacts and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations; (b) Information from work being carried out by other UNFCCC bodies that may be relevant in considering potential impacts. Option 2: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the need to deepen the understanding of potential consequences of response measures taken by Annex I Parties on developing country Parties and that this can be achieved through various means including assessments of potential and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations. Option 3: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the potential impacts of response measures. The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso noted the need to deepen the understanding on the potential impacts of response measures to respond to climate change. This could be achieved through: 53 FCCC/SBI/2010/10 (a) | Assessments of potential impacts and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations; (b) Information from work being carried out by other UNFCCC bodies that may be relevant in considering potential impacts; (c) The regular and systematic provision by all Parties of information that is as complete as possible on potential and observed impacts of policies and measures, in particular through national communications, and the regular review of this information. 10. Concerned about the gaps in methodology to incorporate information on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures, in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1. 11. The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on international spillover effects as described in its Fourth Assessment Report, and [that the IPCC has decided][its plans] to further assess [this issue][and co-benefits and trade-offs] in its Fifth Assessment Report. 12. [The SBI [and the SBSTA Jinvited Parties and relevant organizations to submit to the secretariat, by xx, further information and views on issues relevant to Article 3, paragraph 14[, and Article 2, paragraph 3,] of the Kyoto Protocol, including views on whether a workshop should be held on this matter, and on the issues to be dealt with at any such workshop and to compile the submissions into a miscellaneous document. ] Alt: [[Invites ][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso invited] Annex I Parties to submit (by xx) information on the different ways used for reporting on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures, in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1 and [requests ][requested ]the secretariat to compile the information submitted above. ] 13. [Decides][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]decided ]Jto work on a road map for a phased approach to the implementation of Article 3, paragraph 14, of the Kyoto Protocol, to further its implementation and in accordance with decision 13/CMP.1, and to establish a common reporting methodology to incorporate information on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures, in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1. The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso decided that the common reporting methodology shall be guided by transparency, consistency, comparability, completeness and accuracy. 14. [Requests][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jrequested] the IPCC to develop guidelines to help determine if Parties included in Annex I to the Convention are striving to minimize adverse effects, including the adverse effects of climate change, effects on international trade, and social, environmental and economic impacts on other Parties, especially developing country Parties, and in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Convention. 15. [Decides][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]Jdecided] to consider what further actions are necessary to help developing country Parties, and in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention. Among the issues to be considered shall be the establishment of funding, insurance and transfer of technology, pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 14. 16.
