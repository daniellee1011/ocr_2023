The Committee would then determine whether or the situatio consideratio n, ns before it to the Commission and prepare a summary repor not to refer for its t identifying the main issues of concern and suggested ways of addressing those concer form of draf ns, but would not make recomme resolutions or decisions; Deliberations at the Commission level would also ndations in the involve two (ii) phases: (1) A closed meeting at the earliest possible stage in the session, to which the Governments concerned would be invited, to undertake a meaningful dialogue with the Commission ; and (1ii) A second closed meeting, towards the conclusion of the session, and in the presence of the Governments concerned, to decide on appropriate action, including a decision whether to continue or discontinue consideration of the matter within the confidential procedure, or whether to take up the mat should be cooperatio (c) At the conclusio ter in the Commission's public proceedings - which the principal option in cases in which government n has been inadequate; n of a session, the Chair of the Commission should announce publicly the names of the countries considered, the main issues of concern and the course of ac tion which the Commission has decided to take; (d) OHCHR would continue to play a crucial role in providing the necessary support for the procedure to ensur ffective performance of all the necessary tasks, inter alia: (ii) - Ensuring appropriate acknowledgement, and referral to concerned Governments, of communications received; - Sifting out communications that appear to be manifestly unfounded; - Ensuring that Governments concerned are kept appropriately and punctually advised of any decision taken in the Committee that requires their attention; - Preparing material/dossiers for deliberations by the Committee and the Commission. RECOMMENDATION 12: (a) Reflecting the role of the Sub-Commission in assisting the Commission to address a broad range of human rights issues, it should be renamed “the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights”; (b) Reflecting the proposed sharpening of the Sub-Commission's role as an independent expert body focusing its attention on priorities determined by the Commission: (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to consultation with the Bureau, qualifications, to serve a four-year term, maximum of one additional four-year term. on the basis of their expert renewable for a To preserve the image of the Sub-Commission as an independent expert body, no member should be concurrently employed in the executive branch of their country's Government; (ii) The length of annual sessions of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to two weeks; (c) The Sub-Commission's work and priorities should be based on tasks entrusted to it by the Commission on Huma on the elaboration of studies, research a n Rights, with the principal focus nd expert advice at the request of the Commission. The Commission should regard the Sub-Commission's experts as i1ts foremost resource for the performa than appointing others to undertak considering the assignment of projec nce of such assignments, rather xpert research and analysis; and in ts to the Sub-Commission, the Commission might consider relevant proposals from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, from other United Nations human righ CS institutions and from the Sub-Commission itself; (d) The Sub-Commission's wor and study projects should, consistent king methods in respect of its research with th independent xpert character of (ii) the body, entail a well-prepared, thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question, any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission. This approach would preclude the need for negotiating traditional resolutions for submission to the Commission. While the Sub-Commission's deliberations should provide opportunities for interested Governments, international organizations and NGOs to provide input into this process, the experts should also be prepared to dedicate adequate time to private deliberations on their projects, inter alia in the framework of sessional working groups such as the existing working group on the administration of justice; (e) Recognizing the important opportunities the Sub-Commission and some of its subsidiary bodies play in affording a public forum for concerned parties to raise their human rights concerns: (1) The Sub-Commission should continue to conduct an annual debate on human rights violations in all parts of the world. However, rather than leading to the negotiation of resolutions, this debate should be reflected in a summary to the Commission as part of the Sub-Commission's annual report; (i1) The Sub-Commission's inter-sessional Working Groups on Minorities and on Indigenous Populations should continue to perform the valuable work they ar ngaged in, the latter until such time as the question of its future status is resolved in the context of the Commission's deliberations on a permanent forum for indigenous people in the United Nations system. The question of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery is addressed in recommendation 1 above; (f) As regards transitional arrangements associated with these proposed changes, the Bureau recommends that the Commission devise a transitional process aimed at bringing the recommended reforms fully into effect for the fifty-second session of the Sub-Commission in the year 2000. RECOMMENDATION 13: (a) Before referring any matter to a working group, the Commission on Human Rights should, where the needed groundwork has not been otherwise laid, request the Sub-Commission to undertake a study on the question at hand and (ii) prepare a text of the instrument envisaged. Among the issues to be addressed in any such study, and in the Commission's deliberations on whether to proceed, careful consideration should be given to the purposes of any ing exercise and to the guidelines set out in General Assembly resolution 41/120; (b) In creating any standard-setting working group, the Commission should consider and agree on a specific time-frame within which the group would be called upon to complete its task. This could vary depending on the complexity of the issue and the nature of the instrument (e.g. a procedural protocol might reasonably be completed within two or three years), but in any event the established time-frame should not exceed five years. If, by the end of its mandate, the working group has not been able to achieve a result, the Commission should set a period of reflection (such as one or two years) before any extension is provided; (c) Regarding the question of concluding a standard-setting exercise with or without a vote, it should be borne in mind that there is no rule of procedure requiring the Commission on Human Rights, ECOSOC or the General Assembly to adopt standard-setting instruments by consensus, and there are indeed examples where consensus has not been achieved. O0Of course, all efforts should be made at reaching consensus; (d) Finally, all working group chairs (whose terms should be linked with that of the working group) should have standing authority to undertake, between working group meetings, informal contacts and consultations with a view to advancing progress in respect of the working group's mandate. Results of such consultations should be communicated to concerned delegations on a timely basis and at the start of each session.",04/23/1999,1999_1489910,Poland,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council. 1503 procedure be amended in the following ways: 15 members, nominated by the Chair of the Commission in",yes

GE.99-65798 INTRODUCTION 1. The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). at its tenth session. decided to forward to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) a decision on guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex [ to the Convention, Part [ UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. to be recommended for adoption by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its fifth session. The SBL. at its tenth session. noted the conclusion and agreed to recommend it, jointly with the SBSTA. for adoption by the COP at its fifth session. The decision is contained in this document. Annex | to the decision contains the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. Annex II to the decision contains the common reporting format of these guidelines. 2. The SBSTA advised the SBI to set up a two-year trial period, to commence in early 2000, to assess the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, particularly the common reporting format, with a view to revising them at COP 7, taking into consideration, inter alia, experience gained by the Parties and the secretariat. and the input from [PCC. The SBL following the advice of the SBSTA, agreed to set up the two-year trial period. 3. The SBSTA requested Parties to submit electronically to the secretariat any further technical corrections to the common reporting format by 13 July 1999. so that the text of the guidelines could be completed in time for the fifth session of the COP. 4. Finland. on behalf of the European Community and its member States, Sudan. Switzerland and the United States of America provided technical corrections to the common reporting format in accordance with the mandate ot the SBSTA mentioned in paragraph 3 above. The corrections made have not changed the essence or content of the tables of the common reporting format. but rather have improved their layout. consistency and clarity. Draft decision --/CP.5 Communtications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention: guidelines and schedule The Conference of the Parties, Recalling the relevant provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in particular, Article 4, Article 10. paragraph 2, and Article 12, Recalling its decisions 3/CP.1 on preparation and submission of national communications from Parties included in Annex [ to the Convention. 4/CP.1 on methodological issues. 9/CP.2 on communications from Parties included in Annex [ to the Convention: guidelines. schedule and process for consideration. and 11/CP.4 on national communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention. Recognizing that anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol should be reported in a transparent, consistent. comparable. complete and accurate way. Noting that the revised guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, annexed to decision 9/CP.2. need to be updated to improve the transparency. consistency, comparability. completeness and accuracy of the reported national greenhouse gas inventories and other information. Noting the ongoing process of improvement in guidance to Parties on the reporting of GHG inventories. in particular the work of the IPCC related to uncertainties and good pructices, l. Decides to adopt the guidelines tor the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention. Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. contained in the annex to this decision; 2. Decides that Parties included in Annex I to the Convention should use the UNFCCC guidelines on annual inventories for reporting inventories due by 135 April each year. beginning in the vear 2000: 3. Invites Parties included in Annex I to the Convention to submit separately, by 1 July 2001. information to the secretariat on experiences with using the guidelines. in particular the common reporting format. in the vears 2000-2001: 4. Requests the secretariat to prepare a report on the use of the guidelines, in particular the common reporting format, taking into account, infer alia, experiences gained by Parties in using the guidelines. and by the secretariat in processing the common reporting format. and input from the [PCC, for consideration by the SBSTA at its fifteenth session in considering possible revisions to the guidelines; and ) 5. Decides that revisions to these guidelines. particularly the common reporting format, shall be considered by the SBSTA at its fifteenth session with a view to submitting a decision for adoption at COP 7. Annex I to the decision GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION OF NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS BY PARTIES INCLUDED IN ANNEX I TO THE CONVENTION PART I: — UNFCCC REPORTING GUIDELINES ON ANNUAL INVENTORIES A. Objectives The objectives of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories are: (a) To assist Annex [ Parties in meeting their commitments under Articles 4 and 12 of the Convention and in preparing to meet possible future commitments under Articles 3. 5 and 7 of the Kyoto Protocol:. (b) To facilitate the process of considering annual national inventories and national inventories included in national communications. including the preparation of technical analysis and synthesis documentation: and (¢) To facilitate the process of verification and technical assessment and expert review of the inventory intormation. B. Principles and definitions 2. National greenhouse gas inventories. reterred to below only as inventories. should be transparent. consistent. comparable. complete and accurate. 3. [nventories should be prepared using comparable methodologies agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties (COP). as indicated in paragraph 7 below. and any good practices' agreed upon by the COP at a future session. In the context of these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories: Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory ' The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is currently developing guidance on good practices as part of its work related to uncertainties in inventories. This guidance may be available for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) in 2000. Guidance on good practices may include. inter aliu, advice on the choice of methodology. emission factors, activity data, and uncertainties, and on a series of quality assessment and quality control procedures which may be applied during the preparation of inventories. should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the process for the communication and consideration of information: Consistency means that an inventory should be internally consistent in all its elements with inventories of other years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks. Under certain circumstances referred to in paragraphs 10 and 11, an inventory using different methodologies for different years can be considered to be consistent if it has been recalculated in a transparent manner. taking into account any good practices; ' Comparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by Parties in inventories should be comparable among Parties. For this purpose, Parties should use the methodologies and formats agreed by the COP for estimating and reporting inventories. The allocation of different source/sink categories should follow the split of the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. at the level of its summary and sectoral tables. Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks. as well as all gases, included in the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas [nventories, as well as other existing relevant source/sink categories which are specitic to individual Parties. and therefore may not be included in the [IPCC Guidelines. Completeness also means full geographic coverage of sources and sinks of a Party .’ Accuracy is a relative measure of the exactness of an emission or removal estimate. Estimates should be accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over or under true emissions or removals. as far as can be judged. and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Appropriate methodologies conforming to guidance on good practices should be used to promote uccuracy in inventories. C. Scope 5. These UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories cover the estimation and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals of both annual inventories and inventories included in national communications, as specified by decision 11/CP.4 and other relevant ‘decisions of the COP. D. Base vear 5 > According to the instruments of ratification. acceptance. approval or accession of the Convention by a given Party. 6. The vear 1990 should be the base year for the estimation and reporting of inventories. According to the provisions of Article 4.6 of the Convention and decisions 9/CP.2 and 11/CP 4. the tollowing Annex I Parties that are undergoing the process of transition to a market economy. are allowed to use a base vear or a period of years other than 1990. as follows: to use 1988 to use the average of the years 1985 to 1987 to use 1988 to use 1989 to use 1986 Bulgaria: Hungary: Poland: Romania: Slovenia: E. Methods Methodologv 7. Parties shall use the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. referred to below as the IPCC Guidelines, to estimate and report on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In accordance with the TPCC Guidelines. Parties may use different methods (tiers) included in those guidelines. giving priority to those methods which are believed to produce the most accurate estimates, depending on the data available. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. Parties can also use national methodologies which they consider better able to reflect their national situation provided that these methodologies are compatible with the IPCC Guidelines and are well documented. 8. The IPCC Guidelines offer a default methodology which includes default emission factors and in some cases default activity data. As these default data. factors and assumptions may not always be appropriate for specitic national contexts. it is preterable that Parties use their own national emission factors and activity data. where available. provided that they are developed in a manner consistent with any good practices. and considered to be more accurate, and the reporting of the emission and removal estimates and their underlying data is transparent. Good practices 9. When preparing inventories. Parties should apply any good practices agreed upon by the COP, in order to improve transparency. consistency, comparability. completeness and accuracy. Recalculations 10. The purpose of all recalculations should be the improvement of accuracy and/or completeness. Recalculations have to ensure consistency of the time-series. The inventories of an entire time-series. including the base vear and all subsequent years for which inventories have been reported. should be estimated using the same methodologies. and the underlying activity data and emission factors should be obtained and used in a consistent manner. Where the methodology or manner in which underlying activity data and emission factors are gathered has changed. Parties should recalculate inventories for the base and subsequent years. 1. However, in some cases activity data may be missing for some historical years, including the base vear. In this case, emissions or removals for these years may need to be recalculated with alternative methodologies. In these instances, Parties should demonstrate that the time- series is consistent. The alternative methodologies should be documented in a transparent manner. taking into account any good practices. Uncertainties 12, Parties should estimate the uncertainties of their inventories using the best methodologies available to them, taking account of any good practices. F. Reporting 1.

Article 12.1(a) of the Convention requires that each Party shall communicate to the COP. through the secretariat. inter alia. a national inventory of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Ata minimum. inventories shall contain information on the following six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO.). methane (CH,). nitrous oxide (N,O). pertluorocarbons (PFCs). hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). and sulphur hexatluoride (SF,). Parties should report emissions and removals of any other greenhouse gases whose 100-year global warming potential (GWP) values have been identitied by the IPCC and adopted by the COP. Parties should also provide information on the following indirect greenhouse gases: carbon monoxide (CO). nitrogen oxides {NO,) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Parties are encouraged to provide information on sulphur oxides (SO,). 14. Greenhouse gas emissions and removals should be presented on a gas-by-gas basis in units of mass with emissions by sources listed separately from removals by sinks. except in cases where it may be technically impossible to separate information on sources and sinks in the areas of land-use. land-use change and forestry. For HFCs and PFCs. emissions should be reported for each relevant chemical in the category on a disaggregated basis except in cases where paragraph 19 applies. 15. In addition. consistent with decision 2/CP.3. Parties should report aggregate emissions and removals of greenhouse gases. expressed in CO, equivalent terms at summary inventory level.” using GWP values provided by the IPCC in its Second Assessment Report, referred to below as 1995 IPCC GWP values, based on the effects of greenhouse gases over a 100-year time horizon. A list of these values is given in table 1 at the end of this document. Table 1 will be amended to include any additional greenhouse gases and their 100-year GWP values. once the GWP values have been adopted by the COP. 16. Consistent with decision 2/CP.3. Parties should report actual emissions of HFCs. PFCs and SF,, where data are available. providing disaggregated data by chemical (for example. HFC-134a) and source category in units of mass and in CO, equivalents. Parties should make every effort to develop the necessary sources of data for reporting actual emissions. For the source categories where the concept of potential emissions applies. and Parties do not yet have the necessary data to calculate actual emissions. Parties should report disaggregated potential emissions. Parties reporting actual emissions should also report potential emissions for the sources where the concept of potential emissions applies. for reasons of transparency and comparability. 17. Parties are strongly encouraged to also report emissions and removals of greenhouse gases for which 100-year GWP values are available, but not yet adopted by the COP. These emissions and removals should be reported separately from national totals. The GWP value and reference should be indicated. 18. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. international aviation and marine bunker fuel emissions. based upon fuel sold to ships or aircraft engaged in international transport. should not be included in national totals. but reported separately. Parties should also report emissions from international aviation and marine bunker fuels as two separate entries in their inventories. 19. Emissions and removals should be reported on the most disaggregated level of each source/sink category. taking into account that a minimum level of aggregation may be required to protect confidential business and military information. 3 CO. equivalent emissions should be provided at a level of disaggregation similar to summary table 7A of the IPCC Guidelines. Recalculations 20. Recalculations of previously submitted estimates of emissions and removals as a result of changes in methodologies, changes in the manner in which emission factors and activity data are obtained and used or the inclusion of new sources or sinks. which have existed since the base year but were not previously reported. should be reported for the base year and all subsequent years. up to the vear in which the recalculations are made. Recalculations should result in an improvement in the accuracy and completeness of the inventory and ensure the consistency of the time-series. In this regard, Parties should report justifications for these changes. The information on the procedures used for performing the recalculations, changes in the calculation methods. emission factors and activity data used. and inclusion of sources or sinks. should be documented in a transparent manner, indicating the relevant changes in each source or sink category where these changes have taken place. Completeness 21. Where methodological or data gaps in inventories exist. information on these gaps should be presented in a transparent manner. Parties should clearly indicate the sources and sinks not considered in their inventories but included in the IPCC Guidelines. and explain the reason for the exclusion. In addition. Parties should use the standard indicators presented below to fill the blanks in all the tables of an inventory. This approach facilitates assessment of the completeness of'an inventory. The standard indicators are as follows: () “NO™ (not occurring) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that do not occur for a particular gas or source/sink category within a country; (b) “NE™ (not estimated) for existing emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which have not been estimated. Where ""NE” is used in an inventory for emissions or removals of CO-, N-O. CH,, HFCs. PFCs, or SF,. the Party should indicate, using the completeness table of the common reporting format. why emissions could not be estimated: (c) “NA"" (not applicable) for activities in a given source/sink category that do not result in emissions or removals of a specific gas. If categories in the common reporting format for which “NA™ is applicable are shaded. they do not need to be filled in: (d) “[E™ (included elsewhere) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of ‘greenhouse gases estimated but included elsewhere in the inventory instead of the expected source/sink category. Where “IE” is used in an inventory. the Party should indicate. using the completeness table of the common reporting format, where in the inventory the emissions or removals from the displaced source/sink category have been included and the Party should give the reasons for this inclusion deviating from the expected category: =™ (confidential) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse [¢7 gases which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. given the provisions of paragraph 19 above: and (t) “0” for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which are estimated to be less than one half the unit being used to record the inventory table, and which therefore appear as zero after rounding. The amount should still be included in the national totals and any relevant subtotals.*’ In the sectoral background tables of the common reporting format Parties should provide data as detailed as methods allow. 22. If Parties estimate emissions and removals from country-specific sources or sinks, or of gases, which are not part of the IPCC Guidelines, they should explicitly describe what source/sink categories or gases these are. as well as what methodologies. emission factors and activity data have been used for their estimation. Verification® 25. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. and for verification purposes, Parties should compare their national estimates of carbon dioxide emissions from fuel/ combustion with those estimates obtained using the [PCC reference approach. and report on them in annual inventories. Parties are also encouraged to report on any peer review of their inventory conducted nationally. Uncertainties’ 24, When reporting greenhouse gas emission and removal inventory data, the level of uncertainty associated with these data and their underlying assumptions should be indicated. The methodologies used for estimating uncertainties should be reported in a transparent manner. Parties are encouraged to report quantitative information on uncertainties where this is available. Adjustments Inventories are to be reported without adjustments related. for example. to climate (8] h work on guod practices and Parties should use any guidance which is subsequently agreed by the COP. With this procedure it is possible that sums of all sectoral tables will differ slightly from sums of summary tables because of rounding effects. ® The SBSTA may wish to consider this issue when more data are available or on completion of the development of guidance on good practices by the IPCC and. as appropriate. expand this section in any subsequent revisions to these guidelines. —] More rigorous requirements for reporting uncertainties may be adopted by the COP once the ongoing work of the IPCC on this matter is completed. variations or trade patterns of electricity. If Parties, in addition. carry out such adjustments to inventory data, they should be reported separately and in a transparent manner, with clear indications of the method followed. 26. Adjustments are regarded as important information in relation to the monitoring of emission and removal trends and the performance of national policies and measures. Individual Parties may choose whether adjustments are applied. in addition to reporting unadjusted inventory data. and if so. indicate which methods are chosen. Parties are further encouraged to share with others their experience with the application of adjustments. 2. Common reporting format 27. Parties shall submit annually to the Conference of the Parties, through the secretariat, the information required under the common reporting format as contained in the annex to these guidelines. This information shall be submitted on an annual basis for the last but one year prior to the year of submission, in accordance with paragraph 5. It should be formally submitted in both electronic form and hard copy. The common reporting format is part of the national inventory report referred to in section 3 below. 28. The common reporting format is a standardized format for reporting estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and removals and other relevant information. It will be provided to Parties by the secretariat and will also be available on the UNFCCC Web site. The common reporting format allows for the improved handling of electronic submissions and facilitates the processing of inventory information and the preparation of useful technical analysis and synthesis documentation. The common reporting format consists of: Summary and sectoral tables: (a) (b) Sectoral background data tables for reporting of aggregate emission factors and activity data; (¢) The [PCC worksheet 1-1 containing estimates of CO- emissions tfrom fuel combustion using the [PCC reference approach and a table for comparing estimates under this reference approach with national estimates. as well as providing explanations of any significant ‘difterences: (d) Tables for reporting. inter alia, aggregate CO, equivalent emissions and removals. recalculations. completeness of the inventory. uncertainty, feedstocks and non-energy use of fuels. international bunkers and multilateral operations. emission trends. and a check-list of the main inventory information requested by these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. 30. The common reporting format follows the source/sink category split of the IPCC sectoral tables. It provides a minimum set of information on methods. aggregate emission factors. and activity data. as well as relevant assumptions that underlie the estimates given in the sectoral tables. —J 31 The information provided by the common reporting format is aimed at enhancing the comparability and transparency of inventories by facilitating, inter alia, activity data and aggregate emission factor cross-comparisons among Parties. and easy identification of possible mistakes, misunderstandings and omissions in the inventories. 3. National inventorv report 32. Parties shall submit to the Conference of the Parties, through the secretariat. a national inventory report containing detailed and complete information on their inventories for all years from the base vear to the vear of the current annual inventory submission. in order to ensure the transparency of the inventory. 33. The national inventory report shall be submitted annually in its entirety to the Conference of the Parties. through the secretariat. in accordance with relevant decisions ot the COP, either as a printed document or electronically and should be updated annually to retlect changes. It should include: (a) The annual inventory information. submitted in accordance with paragraph 27, for all vears from the base vear® to the vear of the current annual inventory submission: (b) Calculation sheets’ or equivalent database information on detailed inventory calculations in each sector. for all vears from the base year to the year ot the current annual inventory submission. containing. inter «lia, disaggregated national emission factors and activity data underlying the estimates; (c) A description of the specttic methodologies and assumptions used in each sector, including an indication of the level ot complexity (IPCC tiers) applied and a description of any national methodology used by the Party. as well as information on anticipated future improvements in methodologies: Reterences or sources of information related to methodologies. emission factors (d) ¥ According to the provisions of Article 4.6 of the Convention and decisions 9/CP.2 and 11/CP.4. some Parties with economies in transition are allowed to use base years other than 1990, as mentioned in paragraph 7 above. national methods. and activity data. as well as the rationale tor their selection: (e) Information on assumptions and conventions underlying the emission and removal estimates, as well as the rationale for their selection; H Specific information on feedstocks and bunkers: With regard to possible double counting or non-counting of emissions, Parties should indicate whether feedstocks have been accounted for in the inventory, and if so. how they have been accounted for; (1) Regarding the reporting of emissions from bunker fuels, Parties should explain how they distinguish between domestic marine and aviation emissions, which are to be included in national totals, and international bunker emissions; (i1) (2) Information on any recalculations related to previously submitted inventory data, as requested in paragraph 20 above; Information on uncertainties, as requested in paragraph 24 above; (h) (1) Information on quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures implemented. N A separate section clearly identitying changes with respect to the previous years, including the changes in methodologies. sources of intormation and assumptions, as well as changes in response to the review process: 34. Parties shall publish their national inventory report. Parties may fulfil that obligation by keeping the national inventory report in its entirety on their national Web sites. G. Record keeping 35. Parties should gather and archive all relevant inventory information for each year. including all disaggregated emission factors. activity data and documentation about how these factors and data have been generated and aggregated for the reporting of the inventory. This ‘information should allow the reconstruction of the inventory. inter aliu, by the expert review teams. Inventory information should be archived from the base vear. including the corresponding data on recalculations applied. The paper trail should enable estimates of emissions and removals to be traced back to the original disaggregated emission tactors and activity data. This information should also facilitate the timely process of claritying inventory data when the secretariat prepares annual compilations of inventories or assesses methodological issues. Parties are encouraged to collect and gather the information in a single national inventorv tacility or to. at least, keep the number of facilities to a minimum. H. Systematic updating of the guidelines 36. Relevant future decisions. once taken by the COP. regarding the reporting of inventories under the Convention should be applied mutatis mutandis to these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on inventories, which will be updated accordingly. 1. Language 37. The national inventory report shall be submitted in one of the official languages of the United Nations.

Annex 1l to the decision COMMON REPORTING FORMAT (Annex to the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories) Notes on the common reporting format 1. This common reporting format consists of summary, reporting and overview tables from the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines). plus newly developed sectoral background tables. Users of IPCC software and of the software for converting from CORINAIR to [PCC formats should be aware that a few small additions have been made to the tables taken from the IPCC Guidelines. 2. Some sectoral background tables call for the calculation of implied emission fuctors. These are top-down ratios between the Party’s emissions estimate and aggregate activity data. The implied emission factors are intended solely for purposes of comparison. They will not necessarily be the emission factors actually used in the original emissions estimate, unless of course this was a simple multiplication based on the same aggregate activity data used to calculate the implied emission factor. 3. Consistent with the IPCC Guidelines. memo items. such as emissions estimates from international marine and aviation bunker fuels. should be reported in the appropriate tables, but not included in national totals. 4. Parties should use the documentation boxes provided at the foot of the sectoral background tables to improve clarity. 5. Parties should complete all cells calling for emissions or removals estimates. activity data or emission tactors. The tollowing standard indicators should be used where data are not entered. (a) “NO™ (not occurring) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that do not occur for a particular gas or source/sink category within a country: (b) “NE™ (not estimated) for existing emissions by sources and removal by sinks of greenhouse gases which have not been estimated. Where ""NE™ is used in an inventory for emissions or removals of CO.. N,O. CH,. HFCs. PFCs. or SF.. the Party should indicate. using the completeness table 9. why emissions could not be estimated: (c) “NA™ (not applicable) for activities in a given source/sink category that do not result in emissions or removals of a specific gas. [f categories in the common reporting format for which ""NA™ is applicable are shaded. they do not need to be filled in: (d) “IE” (included elsewhere) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases estimated but included elsewhere in the inventory instead of the expected source/sink categorv. Where ""IE” is used in an inventory. the Party should indicate using the completeness table 9. where in the inventory the emissions or removals from the displaced source/sink category have been included and the Party should give the reasons for this inclusion deviating trom the expected category:; (e) “C"" (confidential) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, given the provisions of paragraph 19 of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories; (f) “0” for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which are estimated to be less than one half the unit being used to record the inventory table, and which would therefore appear as zero after rounding. The amount should still be included in the relevant subtotals. In the sectoral background tables, Parties should provide data as detailed as methods allow. 6. Parties should complete the data in the additional information boxes. Where the information called for is inappropriate because of the methodological tier used by the Party. the corresponding cells should be completed using the indicator ""NA™. 7. Table 3 (the land-use change and forestry sectoral report) should be completed by Parties. The corresponding sectoral background tables 5 A-D follow the IPCC Guidelines and should be completed by Parties that use [PCC detault methods. The species and ecosystem types given in the background tables are examples and may be changed by Parties to better describe national circumstances. Parties which do not use the sectoral background tables 5 A-D should complete alternative formats. when they are available. 8. Neither the order nor the notation of columns. rows or cells should be changed in the tables because this will complicate data compilation. Any additions to the existing disaggregation of source and sink categories should be made using the spare rows and columns b= provided. Additional changes that are made should be clearly indicated both by using a red font and by underlining the information contained in changed cells. 9. Where recalculations of previously submitted data are necessary for the reasons set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. Parties should - -complete recalculation table 8a for every vear from the base year, and table 8b. Parties should also complete the other tables of the common reporting format for the base year which have changed due to the recalculations.
