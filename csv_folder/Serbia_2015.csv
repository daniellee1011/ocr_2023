further the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming also that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, or civilization, Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and incapacitate the terrorist threat, Expressing, in this regard, its deep appreciation for Arab League Resolution 7804 (7 September 2014), the Paris Statement (15 September 2014), the FATF statement on countering the financing of ISIL (24 October 2014) and the Manama declaration on countering terrorist finance (9 November 2014), Reaffirming its resolution 1373 (2001) and in particular its decisions that all States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists, Recognizing the significant need to build capacities of Member States to counter terrorism and terrorist finance, Reiterating its deep concern that oilfields and their related infrastructure, as well as other infrastructure such as dams and power plants, controlled by ISIL, ANF and potentially other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, are generating a significant portion of the groups’ income, alongside extortion, private foreign donations, kidnap ransoms and stolen money from the territory they control, which support their recruitment efforts and strengthen their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, Condemning in the strongest terms abductions of women and children, expressing outrage at their exploitation and abuse, including rape, sexual abuse, forced marriage, committed by ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and encouraging all state and non-state actors with evidence to bring it to the attention of the Council, along with any information that human trafficking may support the perpetrators financially, Reaffirming the obligation of Member States to freeze without delay funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts; of entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons; and of persons and entities acting on behalf of, or at the direction of such persons and entities, including funds derived or generated from property

refineries and related material, other natural resources including precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper, diamonds, and any other assets are made available to ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and noting that direct or indirect trade with ISIL and ANF in such materials could constitute a violation of the obligations imposed by resolution 2161 (2014), Reminding all States of their obligation to ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in supporting terrorist acts is brought to justice, Reaffirming its decision 2133 (2014) and noting again that ransom payments to terrorist groups are one of the sources of income which supports their

A/HRC/29/L.15 risk of child, early and forced marriage is also highly exacerbated in conflict and humanitarian crisis situations, Deeply concerned by the impact of deep-rooted gender inequalities, norms and stereotypes and of harmful practices, perceptions and customs that are obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular of women and girls, and are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned also that poverty and lack of education are also among the drivers of the practice of child, early and forced marriage, and recalling the fact that child, early and forced marriage is a significant obstacle to access to and/or completion of women’s and girls’ education, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains an impediment not only to the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development of society as a whole, and that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, the meaningful participation of girls in all decisions that affect them, and women’s full, equal and effective participation at all levels of decision-making are a key factor in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical for, inter alia, sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that the complex and challenging nature of child, early and forced marriage necessitates the collective efforts of Governments, lawmakers, judicial authorities, law enforcement officials, traditional and religious leaders, civil society, the media, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders to address the root causes of this practice that exists in different economic, social and cultural settings, Recognizing further the need for national action plans, strategies and policies to end child, early and forced marriage, and coordination mechanisms and multi-sectoral interventions that aim to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, including through national comprehensive strategies to prevent and respond to all forms of violence against children and women, Recognizing that birth registration, and marriage, divorce and death registration, are part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and _ policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development goals, and that the absence of compulsory registration of customary and religious marriages is a major stumbling block for the implementation of existing legislation and other initiatives to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, Recognizing also that awareness-raising on the harmful consequences of child, early and forced marriage, including among men and boys, often contributes to promoting social norms that support efforts by girls and their families to delay the age of marriage, 1. Recognizes that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of violence, and that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, such as the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health; 2. Calls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including girls, women, religious and community leaders, civil society and human rights groups, men and boys, and youth organizations to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive and coordinated responses, strategies and policies to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, and to support already married girls, adolescents and women, including through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection mechanisms, such as safe A/HRC/29/L.15 shelters, access to justice and legal remedies and the sharing of best practices across borders in full compliance with international human rights obligations and commitments; 3.

Affirms the need for States to improve gender disaggregated data collection, research and dissemination of evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, as well as the use of quantitative and qualitative data on harmful practices, disaggregated by sex, age, disability, geographical location, socioeconomic status, education level and other key factors, and to strengthen monitoring and impact assessment of existing policies and programmes as a means of strengthening them, ensuring their effectiveness and implementation, including in the context of the post-2015 development agenda; 9. Calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation and active consultation of children and young people in all issues affecting them, and to create awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks that provide girls and boys with information, life skills training and the opportunities to be empowered and become agents of change within their communities; 10. Urges States to promote awareness-raising and to engage in dialogue within communities on the health implications of child, early and forced marriage, and to improve equal access to health-care facilities and sexual and reproductive health information, education and services, including modern forms of contraception; A/HRC/29/L.15 11. Calls upon States to promote and protect the rights of women and girls to education through enhanced emphasis on quality education, including human rights education and training, and catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, including in remote areas, while recognizing that education is one of the most effective ways to prevent and end child, early and forced marriage and to help already married women and men, girls and boys to make more informed choices about their lives; 12. Urges Governments to promote and protect the human rights of all women and girls, including their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and to adopt and accelerate the implementation of laws, policies and programmes that protect and enable the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including reproductive rights, in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences; 13. Calls upon States, with the support of humanitarian partners, and in full collaboration with concerned communities and other stakeholders, to strengthen monitoring and interventions to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage in humanitarian settings and fragile situations, including by integrating and harmonizing such interventions into efforts focused on conflict prevention, protection of civilians, and access to information and services; 14. Urges States to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by improving safety of girls at, and on the way to and from school, including by establishing a safe and violence-free environment by improving infrastructure, such as transportation, and providing separate and adequate sanitation facilities, improved lighting, playgrounds and safe environments, and adopting policies to prohibit, prevent and address violence against children, especially girls, including sexual harassment and bullying and other forms of violence, through measures such as conducting violence prevention activities in schools and communities and establishing and enforcing penalties for violence against girls; 15. Calls upon States and encourages other stakeholders to address social norms, gender stereotypes and harmful practices that contribute to the acceptance and continuation of the practice of child, early and forced marriage, including by raising awareness of its harm to the victims and the cost to society at large and by providing opportunities for discussion among others, within communities, including with the involvement of unmarried girls and already married girls, adolescents and women, religious, tribal and community leaders, men and boys, and families on the benefits of delaying marriage and ensuring that girls receive education; 16. Calls upon States and the international community to create an environment in which the well-being of women and girls is ensured by, inter alia, cooperating, supporting and participating in efforts for the eradication of poverty, and reaffirms that investment in women and girls and the respect, protection and fulfilment of their rights are among the most effective ways to end the harmful practice of child, early and forced marriage; 17.

"" B/C.12/2002/11. 2/6 as the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2015 update'* published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Welcoming also the fact that, according to Joint Monitoring Programme reports of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund, the Millennium Development target on safe drinking water was formally met, while being deeply concerned, however, that, according to the 2015 Joint Monitoring Programme update, 663 million people still lack access to improved drinking water sources and that eight out of ten people still without improved drinking water sources live in rural areas, Deeply concerned that the world missed the sanitation component of Millennium Goal 7 by almost 700 million people and that more than 2.4 billion people still do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, including more than 946 million people who still practise open defecation, which is one of the clearest manifestations of poverty and extreme poverty, Deeply concerned also that women and girls often face particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, such as education and leisure, or for women earning a livelihood, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, contributes to reinforcing the widespread stigma associated with menstruation, negatively affecting gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside of their homes or practising open defecation, Deeply alarmed that, every year, almost 700,000 children under 5 years of age die as a result of water and sanitation related diseases and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water availability, safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, as well as of inequality and discrimination in the access to safe drinking water and sanitation and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions, "" World Health Organization/United Nations Children’s Fund, Progress on Sanitation and Drinking Water, Geneva, 2015. 3/6 Deeply concerned also that inexistent or inadequate sanitation facilities as well as serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively affect water provision and the sustainable access to safe drinking water, and recognizing that, in progressively realizing the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the promotion and protection of all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Recalling the understanding by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation that the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are closely related, but have distinct features which warrant their separate treatment in order to address specific challenges in their implementation and that sanitation too often remains neglected, if not addressed as a separate right, while being a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, Recalling also that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and human dignity, Acknowledging the importance of equal access to safe drinking water and sanitation as an integral component of the realization of all human rights, 1. Affirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living are essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights; 2. Recognizes that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 3. Welcomes Goal 6 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,’ on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which includes important dimensions related to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 4. Also welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note 4/6 with appreciation in particular of his first reports on affordability of water and sanitation services’? and on the analysis of the different types of water and sanitation services from the perspective of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; '* 5. Calls upon States: (a) To ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and to marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds, with a view to progressively eliminating inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, residence in a slum, income levels and other relevant considerations; (b) To give due consideration to the commitments regarding the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation when implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including through the full implementation of Goal 6; (c) To continuously monitor and regularly analyse the status of the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; (d) To identify patterns of failure to respect, protect or fulfil the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all persons without discrimination and to address their structural causes in policymaking and budgeting within a broader framework, while undertaking holistic planning aimed at achieving sustainable universal access, including in instances where the private sector, donors and non-governmental organizations are involved in service provision; (e) To promote both women’s leadership and their full, effective and equal participation in decision-making on water and sanitation management and to ensure that a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes, including measures, inter alia, to reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education and to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside of their home or practising open defecation; (f) To progressively eliminate open defecation by adopting policies to increase access to sanitation, including for individuals belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups; (g) To approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context, taking into account the need to pursue integrated approaches; (h) To consult and coordinate with local communities and _ other stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation; (i) To provide for effective accountability mechanisms for all water and sanitation service providers to ensure that they respect human rights and do not cause human rights violations or abuses; 3 A/HRC/30/39. 4 4/70/203. 5/6 6. Calls upon non-State actors, including business enterprises, both transnational and others, to comply with their responsibility to respect human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, including by cooperating with State investigations into allegations of abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and by progressively engaging with States to detect and remedy abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 7. Invites regional and international organizations to complement efforts by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 8. Calls upon Member States to enhance global partnerships for sustainable development as a means to achieve and sustain the Goal and the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and highlights the need to develop adequate follow-up and review of progress on the agenda including on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all; 9. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and to endeavour to take steps, individually through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and _ technical cooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures; 10. Stresses the important role of the international cooperation and technical assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 11.
