A national system includes all institutional, legal and procedural arrangements made within a Party included in Annex I for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and for reporting and archiving inventory information. B. Other definitions 3. The meaning of the following terms in these guidelines for national systems” is the same as in the glossary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) good practice guidance,® accepted by the IPCC at its XVI Plenary:’ (a) Good practice is a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimated as far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced as far as possible. Good practice covers choice of estimation methods appropriate to national circumstances, quality assurance and quality control at the national level, quantification of uncertainties, and data archiving and reporting to promote transparency; The guidelines for national systems for the estimation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks under Article 5, paragraph 1 of the Kyoto Protocol are referred to as “guidelines for national systems in this document. (b) Quality control (QC) is a system of routine technical activities to measure and control the quality of the inventory as it is being developed. The QC system is designed to: Provide routine and consistent checks to ensure data integrity, correctness and completeness; (1) Identify and address errors and omissions; (i) Document and archive inventory material and record all QC activities. (iii) QC activities include general methods such as accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations and the use of approved standardized procedures for emission calculations, measurements, estimating uncertainties, archiving information and reporting. Higher tier QC activities also include technical reviews of source categories, activity and emission factor data and methods; (c) Quality assurance (QA) activities include a planned system of review procedures conducted by personnel not directly involved in the inventory compilation development process, to verify that data quality objectives were met, ensure that the inventory represents the best possible estimate of emissions and sinks given the current state of scientific knowledge and data available, and support the effectiveness of the QC programme; (d) Key source category is one that is prioritized within the national inventory because its estimate has a significant influence on a country’s total inventory of direct greenhouse gases in terms of the absolute level of emissions, the trend in emissions, or both; (e) Decision tree is a flow-chart describing the specific ordered steps which need to be followed to develop an inventory or an inventory component in accordance with the principles of good practice. 4. Recalculation, consistent with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories,® is a procedure for re-estimating anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG)' emissions by sources and removals by sinks of previously submitted inventories” as a consequence of changes in methodologies, changes in the manner in which emission factors and activity data are obtained and used, or the inclusion of new source and sink categories. III. OBJECTIVES 5. The objectives of national systems under Article 5, paragraph 1 for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, referred to below as national systems, are: (a) To enable Parties included in Annex I to estimate anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks, as required by Article 5, and to report these emissions by ® FCCC/CP/1999/7. References to greenhouse gases (GHG) in these guidelines for national systems refer to GHGs not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. ¥ “National GHG inventories” are referred to simply as “inventories” in these guidelines for the sake of brevity. sources and removals by sinks in accordance with Article 7, paragraph 1 and relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and/or the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP); (b) To assist Parties included in Annex I in meeting their commitments under Articles 3 and 7; (c) To facilitate the review of the information submitted under Article 7 by Parties included in Annex I, as required by Article §; To assist Parties included in Annex I to ensure and improve the quality of their (d) inventories.

Validation and registration 35. Validation is the process of independent evaluation of a project activity by a designated operational entity against the requirements of the CDM as set out in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and this annex, on the basis of the project design document, as outlined in Appendix B below. 36. Registration is the formal acceptance by the executive board of a validated project as a CDM project activity. Registration is the prerequisite for the verification, certification and issuance of CERs related to that project activity. 37. The designated operational entity selected by project participants to validate a project activity, being under a contractual arrangement with them, shall review the project design document and any supporting documentation to confirm that the following requirements have been met: The participation requirements as set out in paragraphs 28 to 30 above are (a) satisfied; (b) Comments by local stakeholders have been invited, a summary of the comments received has been provided, and a report to the designated operational entity on how due account was taken of any comments has been received; (c) Project participants have submitted to the designated operational entity documentation on the analysis of the environmental impacts of the project activity, including transboundary impacts and, if those impacts are considered significant by the project participants or the host Party, have undertaken an environmental impact assessment in accordance with procedures as required by the host Party; (d) The project activity is expected to result in a reduction in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that are additional to any that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity, in accordance with paragraphs 43 to 52 below; The baseline and monitoring methodologies comply with requirements pertaining (e) to: Methodologies previously approved by the executive board; or (1) Modalities and procedures for establishing a new methodology, as set out in paragraph 38 below; (i) 3] Provisions for monitoring, verification and reporting are in accordance with decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and the present annex; (2) The project activity conforms to all other requirements for CDM project activities in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and the present annex, and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP and by the executive board. 38. If the designated operational entity determines that the project activity intends to use a new baseline or monitoring methodology, as referred to in paragraph 37 (e) (ii) above, it shall, prior to a submission for registration of this project activity, forward the proposed methodology together with the project design document, including a description of the project and identification of the project participants to the executive board for review. The executive board shall expeditiously, if possible at its next meeting but not later than four months, review the proposed new methodology in accordance with the modalities and procedures of this annex. Once approved by the executive board it shall make the approved methodology publicly available along with any relevant guidance and the designated operational entity may proceed with the validation of the project activity and submit the project design document for registration. In the event that the COP/MOP requests the revision of an approved methodology, no CDM project activity may use this methodology. The project participants shall revise the methodology, as appropriate, taking into consideration any guidance received. 39. A revision of a methodology shall be carried out in accordance with the modalities and procedures for establishing new methodologies as set out in paragraph 38 above. Any revision to an approved methodology shall only be applicable to project activities registered subsequent to the date of revision and shall not affect existing registered project activities during their crediting periods. The designated operational entity shall: 40. (a) Prior to the submission of the validation report to the executive board, have received from the project participants written approval of voluntary participation from the designated national authority of each Party involved, including confirmation by the host Party that the project activity assists it in achieving sustainable development; (b) In accordance with provisions on confidentiality contained in subparagraph 27 (h) above, make publicly available the project design document; () Receive, within 30 days, comments on the validation requirements from Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC accredited non-governmental organizations and make them publicly available; (d) After the deadline for receipt of comments, make a determination as to whether, on the basis of the information provided and taking into account the comments received, the project activity should be validated; (e) Inform project participants of its determination on the validation of the project activity. Notification to the project participants will include: Confirmation of validation and date of submission of the validation report to the executive board; or (1) An explanation of reasons for non-acceptance if the project activity, as documented, is judged not to fulfil the requirements for validation; (i) 3] Submit to the executive board, if it determines the proposed project activity to be valid, a request for registration in the form of a validation report including the project design document, the written approval of the host Party as referred to in subparagraph 40 (a) above and an explanation of how it has taken due account of comments received; Make this validation report publicly available upon transmission to the executive board. 41. The registration by the executive board shall be deemed final 8 weeks after the date of receipt by the executive board of the request for registration, unless a Party involved in the project activity, or at least three members of the executive board, requests a review of the proposed CDM project activity. The review by the executive board shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: It shal be related to issues associated with the validation requirements; (a) (b) It shall be finalized no later than at the second meeting following the request for review, with the decision and the reasons for it being communicated to the project participants and the public. 42. A proposed project activity that is not accepted may be reconsidered for validation and subsequent registration, after appropriate revisions, provided that it follows the procedures and meets the requirements for validation and registration, including those related to public comments. 43. A CDM project activity is additional if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by sources are reduced below those that would have occurred in the absence of the registered CDM project activity. 44. The baseline for a CDM project activity is the scenario that reasonably represents the anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity. A baseline shall cover emissions from all gases, sectors and source categories listed in Annex A within the project boundary. A baseline shall be deemed to reasonably represent the anthropogenic emissions by sources that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity if it is derived using a baseline methodology referred to in paragraphs 37 and 38 above. A baseline shall be established: 45. (a) By project participants in accordance with provisions for the use of approved and new methodologies, contained in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and the present annex; (b) In a transparent and conservative manner regarding the choice of approaches, assumptions, methodologies, parameters, data sources, key factors and additionality, and taking into account uncertainty; On a project-specific basis; (c) (d) In the case of small-scale CDM project activities which meet the criteria specified in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP, in accordance with simplified procedures developed for such activities; (e) Taking into account relevant national and/or sectoral policies and circumstances, such as sectoral reform initiatives, local fuel availability, power sector expansion plans, and the economic situation in the project sector. 46. The baseline may include a scenario where future anthropogenic emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels, due to the specific circumstances of the host Party. 47. The baseline shall be defined in a way that CERs cannot be earned for decreases in activity levels outside the project activity or due to force majeure. 48. In choosing a baseline methodology for a project activity, project participants shall select from among the following approaches the one deemed most appropriate for the project activity, taking into account any guidance by the executive board, and justify the appropriateness of their choice: Existing actual or historical emissions, as applicable; or (a) (b) Emissions from a technology that represents an economically attractive course of action, taking into account barriers to investment; or (c) The average emissions of similar project activities undertaken in the previous five years, in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances, and whose performance is among the top 20 per cent of their category. 49. Project participants shall select a crediting period for a proposed project activity from one of the following alternative approaches: (a) A maximum of seven years which may be renewed at most two times, provided that, for each renewal, a designated operational entity determines and informs the executive board that the original project baseline is still valid or has been updated taking account of new data where applicable; or A maximum of ten years with no option of renewal. (b) 50. Reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources shall be adjusted for leakage in accordance with the monitoring and verification provisions in paragraphs 59 and 62 (f) below, respectively. 51. Leakage is defined as the net change of anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases which occurs outside the project boundary, and which is measurable and attributable to the CDM project activity. 52. The project boundary shall encompass all anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases under the control of the project participants that are significant and reasonably attributable to the CDM project activity. H. Monitoring 53. Project participants shall include, as part of the project design document, a monitoring plan that provides for: (a) The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for estimating or measuring anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases occurring within the project boundary during the crediting period; (b) The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for determining the baseline of anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases within the project boundary during the crediting period; (c) The identification of all potential sources of, and the collection and archiving of data on, increased anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases outside the project boundary that are significant and reasonably attributable to the project activity during the crediting period; (d) The collection and archiving of information relevant to the provisions in paragraph 37 (c) above; Quality assurance and control procedures for the monitoring process; (e) (H) Procedures for the periodic calculation of the reductions of anthropogenic emissions by sources by the proposed CDM project activity, and for leakage effects; (2) Documentation of all steps involved in the calculations referred to in paragraph 53 (c) and (f) above. 54. A monitoring plan for a proposed project activity shall be based on a previously approved monitoring methodology or a new methodology, in accordance with paragraphs 37 and 38 above, that: (a) Is determined by the designated operational entity as appropriate to the circumstances of the proposed project activity and has been successfully applied elsewhere; Reflects good monitoring practice appropriate to the type of project activity. (b) 55. For small-scale CDM project activities meeting the criteria specified in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP, project participants may use simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale projects. 56. Project participants shall implement the monitoring plan contained in the registered project design document. 57. Revisions, if any, to the monitoring plan to improve its accuracy and/or completeness of information shall be justified by project participants and shall be submitted for validation to a designated operational entity. 58. The implementation of the registered monitoring plan and its revisions, as applicable, shall be a condition for verification, certification and the issuance of CERs. 59. Subsequent to the monitoring and reporting of reductions in anthropogenic emissions, CERs resulting from a CDM project activity during a specified time period shall be calculated, applying the registered methodology, by subtracting the actual anthropogenic emissions by sources from baseline emissions and adjusting for leakage. 60. The project participants shall provide to the designated operational entity, contracted by the project participants to perform the verification, a monitoring report in accordance with the registered monitoring plan set out in paragraph 53 above for the purpose of verification and certification. 1. Verification and certification 61. Verification is the periodic independent review and ex post determination by the designated operational entity of the monitored reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that have occurred as a result of a registered CDM project activity during the verification period. Certification is the written assurance by the designated operational entity that, during a specified time period, a project activity achieved the reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases as verified. 62. In accordance with the provisions on confidentiality in paragraph 27 (h) above, the designated operational entity contracted by the project participants to perform the verification shall make the monitoring report publicly available, and shall: (a) Determine whether the project documentation provided is in accordance with the requirements of the registered project design document and relevant provisions of decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and the present annex; (b) Conduct on-site inspections, as appropriate, that may comprise, inter alia, a review of performance records, interviews with project participants and local stakeholders, collection of measurements, observation of established practices and testing of the accuracy of monitoring equipment; If appropriate, use additional data from other sources; (c) (d) Review monitoring results and verify that the monitoring methodologies for the estimation of reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources have been applied correctly and their documentation is complete and transparent; (e) Recommend to the project participants appropriate changes to the monitoring methodology for any future crediting period, if necessary; (H) Determine the reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that would not have occurred in the absence of the CDM project activity, based on the data and information derived under paragraph 62 (a) and obtained under paragraph 62 (b) and/or (c), as appropriate, using calculation procedures consistent with those contained in the registered project design document and in the monitoring plan; (2) Identify and inform the project participants of any concerns related to the conformity of the actual project activity and its operation with the registered project design document. Project participants shall address the concerns and supply relevant additional information,; (h) Provide a verification report to the project participants, the Parties involved and the executive board. The report shall be made publicly available. 63. The designated operational entity shall, based on its verification report, certify in writing that, during the specified time period, the project activity achieved the verified amount of reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that would not have occurred in the absence of the CDM project activity. It shall inform the project participants, Parties involved and the executive board of its certification decision in writing immediately upon completion of the certification process and make the certification report publicly available. J. Issuance of certified emission reductions 64. The certification report shall constitute a request for issuance to the executive board of CERs equal to the verified amount of reductions of anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases. 65. The issuance shall be considered final 15 days after the date of receipt of the request for issuance, unless a Party involved in the project activity, or at least three members of the executive board request a review of the proposed CDM project activity. Such a review shall be limited to issues of fraud, malfeasance or incompetence of the designated operational entities and be conducted as follows: (a) Upon receipt of a request for such a review, the executive board, at its next meeting, shall decide on its course of action. If it decides that the request has merit it shall perform a review and decide whether the proposed issuance of CERs should be approved; (b) The executive board shall complete its review within 30 days following its decision to perform the review; (c) The executive board shall inform the project participants of the outcome of the review, and make public its decision regarding the approval of the proposed issuance of CERs and the reasons for it. 66. Upon being instructed by the executive board to issue CERs for a CDM project activity, the CDM registry administrator, working under the authority of the executive board, shall, promptly, issue the specified quantity of CERs into the pending account of the executive board in the CDM registry, in accordance with Appendix D below. Upon such issuance, the CDM registry administrator shall promptly: (a) Forward the quantity of CERs corresponding to the share of proceeds to cover administrative expenses and to assist in meeting costs of adaptation, respectively, in accordance with Article 12, paragraph 8, to the appropriate accounts in the CDM registry for the management of the share of proceeds; (b) Forward the remaining CERs to the registry accounts of Parties and project participants involved, in accordance with their request.

PART II: REVIEW OF ANNUAL INVENTORIES A. Purpose The purpose of the review of annual inventories of Parties included in Annex I is: 50. (a) To provide an objective, consistent, transparent, thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of annual inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol for conformity with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories® as elaborated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories’ and any good practice ¥ In these guidelines the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are referred to as the [IPCC Guidelines. ’ In these guidelines the IPCC report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance. guidance adopted by the COP/MOP, and with section I of the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7; (b) To assess if adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, may be needed and, if so, to calculate adjustments in accordance with relevant decisions of the COP/MOP relating to Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol; (c) To ensure that the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee have reliable information on the annual inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol of each Party included in Annex L. B. General procedures The review should cover: 51. (a) The annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format (CRF); (b) Supplementary information under Article 7, paragraph 1, incorporated in the Party’s national inventory according to section I.D, greenhouse gas inventory information, of the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7. The annual inventory review shall consist of two elements: 52. Initial check by the expert review team, with the assistance of the secretariat; (a) Individual inventory review by the expert review team. (b) 53. The individual inventory review shall occur in conjunction with the review of assigned amount, changes in national systems and changes in national registries as set out in part I of these guidelines. 54. The base year inventory shall be reviewed only once prior to the commitment period and adjusted if appropriate. 55. The annual inventory review should be conducted as a desk or centralized review. In addition, each Party included in Annex I shall be subject to at least one in-country visit by an expert review team during the commitment period as part of its annual review. 56. In-country visits should be scheduled, planned and take place with the consent of the Party included in Annex I subject to review. 57. Inyears when an in-country visit is not scheduled, an expert review team can request an in-country visit if it believes, based on the findings of the desk or centralized review, that such a visit is necessary to allow for fuller investigation of a potential problem that the team has identified, subject to the consent of the Party included in Annex I. The expert review team shall provide a rationale for the additional country visit and shall compile a list of questions and issues to be addressed during the country visit to be sent to the Party included in Annex I in advance of the visit. If such an in-country visit occurs, the expert review team may recommend that a pending scheduled in-country visit is not necessary. 58. If aParty included in Annex I fails to provide to the expert review team the data and information necessary for the assessment of conformity with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP, the expert review team shall assume that the estimate was not prepared in accordance with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP. C. Initial checks of annual inventories 1. Scope of the review 59. The expert review team shall conduct an initial check as a desk or centralized review to examine that each Party included in Annex I has submitted a consistent, complete and timely annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format and that data contained in the CRF are complete by means of computerized analysis and checks and in the correct format to enable subsequent review stages to occur. The initial check shall identify whether: 60. (a) The submission is complete and information has been provided in the correct format in accordance with reporting guidelines on annual inventories; (b) All sources, sinks and gases included in the [IPCC Guidelines and any good practice adopted by the COP/MOP are reported; (c) Any gaps are explained by use of notation keys, such as NE (not estimated) and NA (not applicable), in the CRF and whether there is frequent use of these notation keys; Methodologies are documented with notations in the CRF; (d) (e) Estimates for carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions from fossil fuel combustion are reported using the IPCC reference approach, in addition to estimates derived using national methods; (H) Estimates for hydrofluorocarbon, perfluorocarbon and sulphur hexafluoride emissions are reported by individual chemical species; (g) A Party included in Annex I has failed to submit an annual inventory or the national inventory report or the common reporting format by the due date, or within six weeks of the due date; (h) A Party included in Annex I has failed to include an estimate for a source category (as defined in chapter 7 of the IPCC good practice guidance) that individually accounted for 7 per cent or more of the Party’s aggregate emissions, defined as aggregate submitted emissions of the gases and from the sources listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, in the most recent of the Party’s reviewed inventories in which the source was estimated. (1) A Party included in Annex I has failed to provide the supplementary information in accordance with paragraphs 5 to 9 of annex I to the decision /CMP.1 (Guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol). 2. Timing10 61. The initial check for each Party included in Annex I shall be performed and a status report shall be completed within four weeks after the submission date of the annual inventory and sent to the Party for comment. A delay in the preparation of the status report shall not shorten the time available for the Party concerned to comment on the status report. The secretariat shall immediately notify the Party concerned of any omissions or technical format problems identified in the initial check. 62. Any information, corrections, additional information or comments on the status report received from the Party included in Annex I within six weeks of the submission due date shall be subject to an initial check and shall be covered in the final status report. A delay in the submission of the annual inventory shortens the time available for the Party concerned to comment on the status report. 63. The status report on the initial check for each Party included in Annex I shall be finalized within ten weeks from the submission due date to be used in the individual inventory review. 3. Reporting The status report shall include: 64. The date of receipt of the inventory submission by the secretariat; (a) (b) An indication whether the annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the CRF, has been submitted; (c) An indication whether any source category or gas of a source category is missing and, if so, an indication of the magnitude of the likely emissions of that source category or gas, if possible relative to the last inventory for which the review has been completed; (d) Identification of any inventory problems according to the categories listed in paragraph 60 (g) to (i). D. Individual inventory reviews 1. Scope of the review The expert review team shall, inter alia: 65. (a) Examine application of the requirements of the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by any IPCC good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP and the reporting guidelines on annual inventories and relevant decisions of the COP/MOP, and identify any departure from these requirements; ' For the initial review, the time frames for the initial check may serve as an indication. (b) Examine application of the reporting requirements of the section I.D of the guidelines for the preparation of information required under Article 7; (c) Examine whether the IPCC good practice guidance and any other good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP was applied and documented, in particular noting the identification of key source categories, selection and use of methodologies and assumptions, development and selection of emission factors, collection and selection of activity data, reporting of consistent time-series, reporting of uncertainties related to inventory estimates and methodologies used for estimating those uncertainties and identify any inconsistencies; (d) Compare emission or removal estimates, activity data, implied emission factors and any recalculations with data from previous submissions of the Party included in Annex I to identify any irregularities or inconsistencies; (e) Compare the activity data of the Party included in Annex I with relevant external authoritative sources, if feasible, and identify sources where there are significant differences; 3] Assess the consistency of information in the common reporting format with that in the national inventory report; (g) Assess the extent to which issues and questions raised by expert review teams in previous reports have been addressed and resolved; (h) Recommend possible ways for improving the estimation and the reporting of inventory information. 66. The expert review team may use relevant technical information in the review process, such as information from international organizations. 67. The secretariat shall, under the direction of the expert review team, conduct a standardized set of data comparisons to be performed on the electronic common reporting format submissions to be used in the review process. 2. Identification of problems 68. The individual inventory review shall identify any problems for which adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, would be appropriate and initiate procedures for calculation of adjustments. 69. Problems should be identified as a failure to follow agreed guidelines under Article 5, paragraph 2, in preparing greenhouse gas inventories, as a failure to follow section I of the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7, and as a failure to follow agreed methodologies for estimating and reporting activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, as adopted by the COP/MOP. These may be further subdivided as problems of: (a) Transparency, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories,'"" including: Inadequate documentation and description of methodologies, assumptions and recalculations; (1) Failure to disaggregate national activity data, emission factors and other factors used in national methods at the required level unless an issue of confidentiality exists; (i) Failure to provide justifications for recalculations, references and information sources for key factors and data; (iii) (b) Consistency, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including failure to provide consistent time-series in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance; (c) Comparability, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including failure to use agreed reporting formats; (d) Completeness, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including: Gaps in the inventory estimates for source categories or gases; (1) Inventory data that do not provide full geographic coverage of sources and sinks of a Party included in Annex [; (i) Failure to provide full coverage of sources in a source category; (iii) (e) Accuracy, as defined in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories, including failure to provide estimates of uncertainty and address uncertainty through the application of the good practice. The expert review team shall calculate: 70. (a) The percentage by which the aggregate adjusted greenhouse gas emissions for a Party included in Annex I exceed the aggregate submitted emissions, defined as aggregate submitted emissions of the gases and from the sources listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, for any single year; (b) The sum of the numerical values of the percentages calculated in subparagraph (a) above for all years of the commitment period for which the review has been conducted. 71. The expert review team shall identify whether the same key source category as defined in chapter 7 of the IPCC good practice guidance was adjusted in previous reviews and, if so, the """""" Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories (document FCCC/CP/1999/7) or any subsequent revision of these guidelines by the COP. team shall indicate the number of reviews that identified and adjusted the problem previously and the percentage that the key source category contributes to the aggregate submitted emissions, defined as aggregate submitted emissions of the gases and from the sources listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol. 3. Timing 72. The individual inventory review, including adjustment procedures, shall be concluded within one year of the due date of submission of the information to be reported under Article 7, paragraph 1. 73. The expert review team shall list all problems identified, indicating which would need an adjustment, and send this list to the Party included in Annex I no later than fifteen weeks from the submission due date of the annual inventory, if the inventory was submitted at least six weeks after the submission due date. 74. The Party included in Annex I shall comment on these questions within six weeks and, where requested by the review team, may provide revised estimates. 75. The expert review team shall prepare a individual inventory review report, which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates calculated according to guidance under Article 5, paragraph 2, within eight weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed and shall send the report to the Party concerned. 76. The Party included in Annex I shall be provided with four weeks to comment on the individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether it accepts or rejects the adjustment. 77. The expert review team shall prepare a final individual inventory review report within four weeks of the receipt of the comments on the report. 78. If a Party included in Annex I during the above steps is able to comment earlier than in the above given time-frames, the Party concerned may use the time saved to comment on the revised final report. A total of four additional weeks to comment may be granted to Parties included in Annex I whose national language is not one of the United Nations official languages. 4. Procedures for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2 79. Adjustments referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol shall be applied only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP. The procedure for the calculation of adjustments shall be as follows: 80. (a) During the individual inventory review, the expert review team shall identify problems to which the criteria in the guidance for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, apply. The expert review team shall officially notify the Party included in Annex I of the reason why an adjustment is considered necessary and provide advice on how the problem could be corrected; (b) The adjustment procedure should only commence after the Party included in Annex I has had opportunities to correct a problem and if the expert review team finds that the Party included in Annex I has not adequately corrected the problem through the provision of an acceptable revised estimate, in accordance with the time-frames set out in paragraphs 73 to 78 above; (c) The expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with any guidance under Article 5, paragraph 2, adopted by the COP/MOP, in consultation with the Party concerned and within the time-frame set out in these guidelines;' (d) The expert review team shall officially notify the Party concerned of the calculated adjustment(s) within the time-frame set out in these guidelines. This notification shall describe the assumptions, data and methodologies used to calculate the adjustment(s), as well as the value of the adjustment(s); (e) Within the time-frame set out in these guidelines, the Party concerned shall notify the secretariat of its intention to accept or reject the adjustment(s), with its rationale. Failure to respond by this date shall be considered as acceptance of the adjustment(s), as follows: If the Party concerned accepts the adjustment(s), the adjustment(s) shall be applied for the purpose of compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts; (1) If the Party concerned disagrees with the proposed adjustment(s), it should send a notification to the expert review team, including its rationale, and the expert review team should send the notification along with its recommendation in its final report to the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. (i) 81. A Party included in Annex I may submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory for a year of the commitment period to which an adjustment was previously applied, provided that the revised estimate is submitted, at the latest, in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012. 82. Subject to a review under Article 8 and the acceptance of the revised estimate by the expert review team, the revised estimate shall replace the adjusted estimate. In the event of a disagreement between the Party included in Annex I and the expert review team regarding the revised estimate, the procedure set out in paragraph 79 (e) (ii) above shall be followed. The option for a Party included in Annex I to submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied should not prevent Parties included in Annex I from making best efforts to correct the problem at the time it was initially identified and in accordance with the time-frame set forth in the guidelines for review under Article 8. adjustment needs to be calculated. 5. Reporting 83. The following specific elements shall be included in the reports referred to in paragraph 46 (a) and (b): (a) A summary of the results of the inventory review, including a description of emission trends, key sources and methodologies and a general assessment of the inventory; (b) Identification of any inventory problems according to the categories listed in paragraph 69 and a description of factors influencing the fulfilment of the inventory-related obligations of the Party included in Annex I ; Information on adjustments, if applicable, including, inter alia, (c) The original estimate, if applicable; (1) The underlying problem; (i) The adjusted estimate; (iii) The rationale for the adjustment; (iv) The assumptions, data and methodology used to calculate the adjustment; V) A description of how the adjustment is conservative; (vi) The expert review team’s identification of possible ways for the Party included in Annex I to address the underlying problem; (vii) The magnitude of the numerical values related to an adjusted problem as identified under paragraph 70 above; (viii) Recurrence of adjustments as identified under paragraph 71 above; (ix) An indication whether the adjustment was agreed upon by the Party included in Annex I and the expert review team. ) PART III: REVIEW OF INFORMATION ON ASSIGNED AMOUNTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 3, PARAGRAPHS 7 AND 8, EMISSION REDUCTION UNITS, CERTIFIED EMISSION REDUCTIONS, ASSIGNED AMOUNT UNITS AND REMOVAL UNITS PART IV: REVIEW OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS A. Purpose The purpose of the review of national systems is: &4. (a) To provide a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of the capacity of a national system and the adequacy of its institutional, legal and procedural arrangements to produce an inventory of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks in conformity with Article 5, paragraph 2; (b) To assess the extent to which the guidelines for national systems under Article 5, paragraph 1, have been adhered to, and to assist Parties included in Annex I in meeting their commitments under Article 5, paragraph 1; () To provide the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee with reliable information on national systems established under Article 5, paragraph 1; B. General procedures The review of national systems shall take place in two parts: 85. (a) A thorough review of the national system, as part of the review prior to the commitment period and its in-country visit; (b) A desk or centralized review of any reported changes in the national system reported since the first thorough review, conducted in conjunction with the annual inventory review. 86. The review of national systems shall be conducted, as appropriate, through interviews with personnel involved in inventory planning, preparation and management, and through examination of relevant records and documentation, including use of the inventory CRF and preparation of the national inventory report. 87. Based on any findings during the individual inventory review and on findings related to reported changes in national systems considered by the expert review team to be potentially significant in relation to an identified problem in the inventory of the Party included in Annex I, the expert review team may request an additional country visit to review the relevant components of the national system in conjunction with an in-country inventory review. C. Scope of the review 1. In-country review 88. The expert review team shall conduct a thorough and comprehensive review of the national system of each Party included in Annex I. The review of national systems should cover: (a) Activities undertaken by the Party included in Annex I to implement, and performance of, the general functions described in paragraph 10 of the guidelines for national systems, ' and the specific functions related to inventory planning, preparation and management in accordance with paragraphs 12 to 17 of those guidelines; (b) Reported and archived information on national systems in accordance with guidelines under Article 5, paragraph 1, and Article 7, including plans and internal documentation related to the functions mentioned in subparagraph (a) above. "" The guidelines for national systems for the estimation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks under Article 5, paragraph 1, of the Kyoto Protocol are referred to as “guidelines for national systems” in this document. The full text of those guidelines can be found in document FCCC/CP/2001/L.18. 2. Review of changes in national systems 89. Any significant changes in the functions of the national systems reported by Parties included in Annex I or identified by the expert review team during the in-country visit that may affect the preparation of greenhouse gas inventories in conformity with Article 5, paragraph 2, and the guidelines for national systems should be reviewed annually in conjunction with the annual inventory review. The scope of such a review shall follow the scope set out for the in- country review according to paragraph 88 above. 3. Identification of problems 90.
