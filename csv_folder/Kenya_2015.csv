CMWI/C/GC/1. 3/11 Recognizing the increasing participation of women of all skill levels in international migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration, Recognizing also that the demand for migrant care work appears to be rising, where the failure to resolve care deficits and secure public provision of care has increased the demand for care work, particularly in the private sphere, and that some migrant workers engaged in informal care work, particularly women, face serious human rights abuses owing to the invisible nature of their workplace, while many benefit from the economic opportunities offered by care work, Recognizing the roles and responsibilities of and need for cooperation among all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, through targeted measures, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels, Recognizing also that women migrant workers have the potential to foster equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development through the economic and social impacts, as a result of their work, on countries of origin and destination, and underlining the value and dignity of their labour, including the labour of domestic and care workers, Recognizing further the particular vulnerability and needs of women and their children at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment and integration into the host society, as well as during their return to and reintegration in their countries of origin, Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, sexual violence, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts, discrimination, abusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work and contemporary forms of slavery, inter alia, all forms of forced labour and trafficking in persons, Recognizing that one of the key causes of labour exploitation that migrants, including women migrant workers, suffer is linked to the unscrupulous practices of some recruitment agencies and informal brokers which charge high recruitment fees, and noting with concern the reports of abuse committed by some recruitment agencies and employers, Recognizing also that the intersection of, inter alia, gender, age, class, race and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers and that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination, Reaffirming the commitment to respect, protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on 4/11 the Rights of Indigenous Peoples” to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate, Noting that the priority theme of the sixtieth session of the Commission on the Status of Women will be “Women’s empowerment and its link to sustainable development” and that migration can enable equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development for countries of origin and destination, migrants and their families, and in this regard recognizing the potential role of women migrant workers in contributing to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Concerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, observing with concern that many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified and in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and inadequate social protection, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 12 June 2015, at its 104th session, of International Labour Organization Recommendation No. 204 on the transition from the informal to the formal economy, Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and _ broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender- sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of targeted policies and concrete strategies to specifically address violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse, Recognizing also that the vulnerabilities documented for women migrant workers highlight increasingly complex migration contexts and channels, where migrant workers may find themselves in life-threatening situations when entering other countries, Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote access to justice, such as the establishment of gender-sensitive protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings, Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and of the relevant special °° Resolution 61/295, annex. 5/11 procedures, as well as of the supervisory mechanisms of the International Labour Organization in monitoring
