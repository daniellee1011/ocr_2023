on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and recalling the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and other relevant international instruments, Recalling the obligation of States to register all children, without discrimination of any kind, immediately after birth, which is an important element of the protection and realization

Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and other relevant international instruments to which they are party, Recognizing that birth registration and the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law is closely linked to the realization of all other human rights, and GE.17-04411(E) A/HRC/34/L.24 therefore underlining the importance of a human rights-based approach to birth registration, based on international human rights obligations and commitments operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights, Welcoming States’ commitment to leave no one behind, and recalling that the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration, is included as the standalone target 16.9 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development under Sustainable Development Goal 16, Recognizing that the full implementation of this target will have both a direct and an indirect impact on the achievement of other targets and goals, inter alia social protection, protection in emergencies, access to financial and economic resources, the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and children everywhere, and access to quality education, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other treaty-based bodies towards universal birth registration, such as through recommendations widely addressed to States in this regard, Recalling the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council in which they call upon States to ensure the registration of all children immediately after birth, and without discrimination of any kind, the most recent being Assembly resolution 71/177 of 19 December 2016 and Council resolution 28/13 of 23 March 2015,

exploitation and abuse, including when they take the form of child labour, human trafficking, child, early and forced marriage, and unlawful child recruitment, Recognizing that free birth registration and free or low-fee late birth registration are part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and _ policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that non-governmental organizations, professional

person to be free from hunger, is recognized, Please recycle GE.17-04518(E) A/HRC/34/L.21 Bearing in mind the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, adopted at the World Food Summit in November 1996, the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, adopted on 13 June 2002, and the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming the importance of the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and its Framework for Action, adopted in Rome on 21 November 2014, Acknowledging that the right to food has been recognized as the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate, nutritious food, in conformity with, inter alia, the culture, beliefs, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of individuals, that is produced and consumed sustainably, thereby preserving access to food for future generations, Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, Reaffirming also that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming further that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment at both the national and international levels is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, Determined to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community with a view to achieving substantial progress in the realization of the right to food by an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, with a view to build a community of shared future for humanity, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, and the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Reaffirming that food security is a national responsibility, and that any plan for addressing food security challenges must be nationally articulated, designed, owned and led, and built on consultation with all key stakeholders, and recognizing the commitment to strengthening the multilateral system in the channelling of resources and in the promotion of policies dedicated to fighting hunger and malnutrition, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global A/HRC/34/L.21 dimension and that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to adequate food has been threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Recognizing further the need to urgently assist some African countries that are facing drought, starvation and famine threats that could affect millions of people, most of whom are women and children, who risk losing their lives, Recognizing that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and to sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, while noting the commitment to continuing the agricultural trade discussions as mandated by the World Trade Organization, Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights is taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to food, Recognizing the importance and positive role of smallholder and subsistence farmers, including women farmers, young farmers, family farmers and farmers in less favoured areas, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have, in combination with other factors, resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Recognizing the need to prioritize food security and end hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food systems to the adverse impact of climate change, and, given this situation, that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, Stressing the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable private and public investments in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, which were endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security at its forty-first session, held in October 2014, A/HRC/34/L.21 Stressing the importance of the second International Conference on Nutrition, hosted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, at which the two main outcome documents, namely, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, were endorsed, Bearing in mind that excessive and unregulated exposure to pesticides can have severe impacts on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the right to food, as well as the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Recalling the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management, adopted by the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its thirty- eighth session, in June 2013, Recognizing the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and the right to food for all, Recognizing also the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 on 27 July 2012, and reaffirming the principles contained therein, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity, and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 795 million people in the world remain undernourished owing to the lack of sufficient food for conducting an active and healthy life, including as one of the effects derived from the global food crisis, while, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries; 5. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food- importing developing countries, especially least developed countries; 6. Expresses its great concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries A/HRC/34/L.21 girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Recognizes that reinforcing the rights of girls and women, especially those who are poor and vulnerable, to education and social protection and that increasing women’s participation in decision-making and access to resources in an objective manner are critical for enhancing women’s vital role in advancing agricultural development and food security, and recognizes also in that regard that the promotion of agro-industry through the voluntary dissemination of knowledge, the development and transfer of technology, capacity-building and financial support is a precondition for the involvement of women in advancing agriculture in developing countries; 8. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where such inequality and discrimination contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including by taking measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women and girls have equal access to social protection and resources, including income, land and water, and their ownership, and full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and to strengthen their role in decision-making; 9. Recognizes the importance of smallholder and subsistence farmers and peasants in developing countries, including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring food security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their development; 10. Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate and effectively implement a gender perspective in their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 11. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe, sufficient, nutritious and culturally accepted food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 12. Encourages States to take steps with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms and to adopt national plans to combat hunger; 13. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food, and encourages States to increase such cooperation as a complement to North-South cooperation and to promote triangular cooperation further; 14. Also recognizes the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, inter alia, traditional seed supply systems, including for many indigenous peoples and local communities; 15. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food, and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of national and regional A/HRC/34/L.21 efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, achieving food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and to ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 16. Calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under articles 2 (1) and 11 (2), in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 17. Calls upon States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 18. Recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the right to food; 19. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 20. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and challenges to the full enjoyment of the right to food that indigenous peoples face, and calls upon States to take new actions to combat the root causes of the often disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 21. Welcomes the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, ' held on 22 and 23 September 2014, and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; ' General Assembly resolution 69/2. A/HRC/34/L.21 22. Requests all States, private actors, international organizations and agencies, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 23. Encourages all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security; 24. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitments and international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 25. Notes with appreciation the growing movement, in different regions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and measures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all; 26. Recognizes the importance of giving due consideration to the adverse impact of climate change on the full realization of the right to food; 27.

women and girls at all levels, are essential to efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, Emphasizing the important role that men and boys can play in preventing and eliminating violence against women and girls, including by challenging gender stereotypes and the negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence and further developing and implementing measures that reinforce non-violent actions, attitudes and values, and encouraging men and boys, alongside women and girls, as agents and beneficiaries of gender equality, to take an active part in efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls, Bearing in mind the important role men and boys can play when developing and implementing policies, programmes and strategies for gender equality and for preventing and eliminating violence against women and girls, and in this regard, recognizes United Nations and other strategies and initiatives that promote men and boys’ involvement in gender equality, such as the “HeforShe” campaign, as tools in raising awareness of the crucial roles and responsibilities that men and boys play in the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing the importance of investment to close resource gaps for

“Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted the outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, recognizing that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, and envisaging a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want, a world of universal respect for human rights and human dignity that includes equitable and universal access to health-care services and social protection, and where physical, mental and social well-being are assured, Recognizing that the 2030 Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

and environmental determinants of health, as well as to address holistically a range of barriers arising from inequality and discrimination that impede access to health-care services, Noting with concern that, for millions of people throughout the world, especially for women and girls, the full enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health remains a distant goal, Recognizing that women, youth, children, indigenous persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, persons living with HIV and people of African descent face particular challenges and multifaceted and intersecting forms of discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Deeply concerned that persons with mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities, in particular persons using mental health services, may be subject to, inter alia, widespread discrimination, stigma, prejudice, violence, social

despite the impressive reductions in maternal mortality rates achieved since 1990, according to the World Health Organization, in 2015, there were an estimated 303,000 maternal deaths of women and girls, which were largely preventable, and that many more women and girls suffer serious and sometimes lifelong injuries, which have severe consequences for their enjoyment of their human rights and their overall well- being, Deeply concerned further that more than 5,900,000 children under 5 years of age die each year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to inadequate access or lack of access to integrated and quality maternal, newborn and child health-care services, to early childbearing, and to health determinants, such as safe drinking water and sanitation, safe and adequate food and nutrition, and that mortality remains highest among children belonging to the poorest and most marginalized communities, Regretting the high number of people still without access to

disproportionately high in developing countries, Noting with concern that approximately 54 per cent of persons living with HIV are in need of treatment, many of whom do not know their HIV status, Concerned at the instances of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuses that affect the enjoyment of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen law, policies and practices to eradicate any form of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuse in health-care services, Recognizing that universal health coverage implies that all people have access without discrimination to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and essential, safe, affordable, efficacious and quality A/HRC/35/L.18/Rev.1

marginalized segments of the population, Underscoring that the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, contributes to the efforts to implement the health-related Sustainable Development Goals, while recognizing that, inter alia, discrimination, stigma, corruption, violence and abuse are major obstacles in this regard, Underscoring also that the implementation of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals contributes to the full realization of

entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted the outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, recognizing that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, and envisaging a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want, a world of universal respect for human rights and human dignity that includes equitable and universal access to
