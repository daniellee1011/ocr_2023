Appendix International Guiding Principles on Alternative Development A. General provisions 1. Alternative development policies are an important component of enhancing development in States affected by, or in some cases at risk of, the illicit cultivation of crops used for illicit drug production and manufacture, and play an important role in national, regional and international development policies and in comprehensive policies of poverty reduction and cooperation. 2. Alternative development, as an integral component of policies and programmes for reducing drug production, is an important, viable and sustainable option for preventing, eliminating or significantly and measurably reducing the illicit cultivation of crops used for the production and manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances through tackling poverty and providing livelihood opportunities. 3. Alternative development, including in some cases preventive alternative development, constitutes an international policy founded on the principle of shared and common responsibility that seeks to discourage the cultivation of illicit crops in h E/CN.7/2012/8, annex. V.13-81814 countries affected by that problem and in those countries which are vulnerable to illicit activities. 4. Alternative development, which includes, as appropriate, preventive alternative development strategies and programmes, should be formulated and implemented by taking into account the vulnerability and specific needs of the communities and groups affected by illicit cultivation of crops used for drug production and manufacture, within the broader framework of national policies. 5. Effective alternative development strategies and programmes require, as appropriate, the strengthening of relevant governmental institutions at the national, regional and local levels. Public policies should be supported to the extent possible by, inter alia, strengthening legal frameworks, involving local communities and relevant organizations, identifying and providing adequate financial support, technical assistance and increased investment, and recognizing and enforcing property rights, including access to land. 6. Local communities and relevant organizations should be involved in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all alternative development programmes in order to truly reflect the needs of targeted communities. 7. Civil society can contribute significantly to the formulation of effective and sustainable alternative development programmes, and its active participation should therefore be encouraged in all phases of alternative development programmes. 8. An integrated and complementary approach to alternative development programmes and strategies is crucial and should be implemented in concert with broader drug control policies, including demand reduction, law enforcement, illicit crop elimination and awareness-raising, taking into account demographic, cultural, social and geographic considerations, as appropriate, and in line with the three drug control conventions. 9. States should ensure the proper and coordinated sequencing of development interventions when designing alternative development programmes, and in that regard should take into account issues related to the establishment of agreements and viable partnerships with small producers, favourable climatic conditions, strong political support and adequate market access. 10. Alternative development programmes in the areas where crops are cultivated for illicit drug production and manufacture should be undertaken with a clear understanding of the overall objectives, as appropriate, of eliminating or significantly and measurably reducing the supply of drugs while promoting comprehensive development and _ social inclusion, alleviating poverty and strengthening social development, the rule of law, security and stability at the country and regional levels, taking into account the promotion and protection of human rights. 11. Alternative development programmes should include measures to protect the environment at the local level, according to national and international law and policies, through the provision of incentives for conservation, proper education and awareness programmes so that the local communities can improve and preserve their livelihoods and mitigate negative environmental impacts. V.13-81814 12. Alternative development programmes, including, as appropriate, preventive alternative development programmes, should be designed to address subregional and regional needs and should be integrated, when circumstances require, into broader regional, subregional and bilateral treaties and arrangements. 13. International cooperation, coordination and stakeholder ownership are essential for the successful implementation and sustainability of alternative development programmes. Alternative development should be considered by all parties involved as a long-term commitment whose results may require time to attain. 14. International cooperation programmes aimed at alternative development should take into account the experiences of different countries, including with regard to South-South cooperation, should draw on best practices and lessons learned in alternative development programmes and projects and should take into account the available financial and technical support provided by donors. 15. Alternative development policies, as one of the tools available in the fight against the world drug problem, should be implemented alongside efforts made by States to strengthen the rule of law and promote health, safety and security so as to ensure a comprehensive approach to tackling the challenges that may be posed by the possible links between drug trafficking, corruption and different forms of organized crime and, in some cases, terrorism. 16. Alternative development can be an integral element of an overall development strategy and should complement economic efforts in the fight against poverty. 17. The impact of alternative development programmes should be assessed by taking into account their contribution to the control of illicit crop cultivation, including the eradication of such crops, and through estimates based on human development indexes, socioeconomic and environmental indicators and impartial and accurate evaluations. B. Actions and implementation measures 18. Member States of the United Nations, international organizations, regional organizations, development agencies, donors and international financial institutions, as well as civil society, should apply their utmost efforts, as appropriate, to: (a) Target illicit cultivation and production of crops used for the production and manufacture of illicit drugs, and address related factors, by alleviating poverty, by strengthening the rule of law and institutional frameworks, as appropriate, and by promoting sustainable development aimed at enhancing the welfare of the population;

(s) Promote the strengthening of the justice and security sectors and social development, as well as institutional legal frameworks and anti-corruption measures, in a manner conducive to enhancing alternative development efforts; (t) Promote governance capabilities, when appropriate, in order to strengthen the rule of law, including at the local level; (u) Ensure that measures aimed at strengthening the rule of law are included in development-oriented drug control policies in order to, inter alia, support farmers in their efforts to stop, and in some cases prevent, the cultivation of illicit crops; (v) Apply, in addition to estimates of illicit cultivation and other illicit activities related to the world drug problem, indicators related to human development, socioeconomic conditions, rural development and the alleviation of poverty, as well as institutional and environmental indicators, when assessing alternative development programmes in order to ensure that the outcomes are in line with national and international development objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals, and that they reflect accountable use of donor funds and truly benefit the affected communities; (w) Utilize objective impact evaluations that examine a broad range of social, economic and environmental factors and incorporate the lessons learned from these evaluations in future projects to ensure that the design and implementation of alternative development programmes are based on a reliable and evidence-based evaluation and thorough analysis of local socioeconomic, geographical and cultural realities, as well as the assessment of benefits and risks; (x) Undertake further research and strengthen data collection with a view to providing a basis for more effective and evidence-based alternative development programmes, as well as conduct research to assess the factors leading to the illicit cultivation of drug crops used for the production and manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; (y) Utilize data and conduct analysis to identify areas, communities and affected populations that are vulnerable to illicit cultivation and its related illicit activities, and tailor the implementation of programmes and projects to address identified needs; (z) Encourage partners in cross-border alternative development activities to consider measures to support the implementation of alternative development strategies and programmes, which may include special preferential policies, V.13-81814 protection of property rights and facilitation of the import and export of products, in accordance with relevant international law, including trade agreements; (aa) Enhance technical support, including exchange of expertise, best practices and resources, while seeking to secure long-term flexible funding for alternative development programmes in order to ensure their sustainability; (bb) Consider the possibility of creating an international fund for alternative development programmes that could be used to face major emergency situations, in order to ensure continuity; (cc) Recognize that international cooperation resources for the implementation of alternative development programmes should be used in consultation and in coordination with partner countries to support joint efforts to eliminate, reduce and, in some cases, prevent the cultivation of illicit crops through reducing poverty and enhancing rural development in areas affected by, or in some cases vulnerable to, illicit cultivation and engaging in effective law enforcement measures; (dd) Recognize that long-term cooperation, coordination and the commitment of multilevel and multisectoral stakeholders are essential to a holistic and integrated approach to the effectiveness and sustainability of alternative development programmes;
