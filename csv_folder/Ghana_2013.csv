B. 2/13 further recalling the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective across the United Nations system in relation to the girl child, Recalling the Secretary-General’s 2008-2015 campaign “UNiTE to End Violence against Women” and the call upon Governments, civil society, women’s organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire United Nations system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls, Taking note of the appointment by the Secretary-General of the first Envoy on Youth in line with the imperative, contained in his five-year action agenda, on “Working for and with women and young people”, Recognizing that chronic poverty remains one of the biggest obstacles to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children, including the girl child, Recognizing also that urgent national and international action is required to eliminate poverty, in particular extreme poverty, and noting that the ongoing effects of the global financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those headed by girls, Recognizing further that the phenomenon of child-headed households is linked to other economic, social and political realities, such as armed conflict, natural disasters, lack of economic empowerment and health inequities, and that a comprehensive approach to these problems is needed to resolve the issue of child- headed households, Deeply concerned about the serious social problem of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, and that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, the erosion of the extended family, the exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase in the number of child- headed households, Recognizing that child-headed households may result from the death of parents and/or legal guardians, and that children can become de facto heads of households owing to parental illness, whether physical or mental, parental neglect, the migration of parents or other such factors, Deeply concerned about the extreme vulnerability of children who are heads of households, particularly girls, who may be exceptionally negatively affected by the economic and care burdens placed on them at a young age, which in turn may lead to their having difficulty completing their education and increase their vulnerability to poverty, discrimination, trafficking and physical abuse, Deeply concerned also about the vulnerability of children, in particular the girl child, raised in child-headed households, who suffer from the lack of adult support and may be particularly vulnerable to poverty, mental and psychosocial trauma and physical vulnerability owing to, inter alia, food insecurity and poor nutrition, limited access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and communicable and non-communicable diseases, Deeply concerned further that children heading households may be subjected to stigma and discrimination owing to the fact that parental death is a result of 3/13 HIV/AIDS, and that children heading households may be at greater risk of HIV because of their vulnerability to violence and exploitation as they seek to support their households, Deeply concerned that, in situations of poverty, armed conflict, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies, the incidence of child-headed households increases and makes girl children particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, abuse, exploitation and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that an estimated 68 million girls?° are engaged in child labour and that many of them face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with domestic chores, which deprive them of their childhood and diminish their opportunities to benefit from education and decent employment in the future, Recognizing that the needs of girls vary, according to a number of factors, including their age, and that the risks of violence and discrimination that they face change over their life cycles, from childhood through adolescence, Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing further that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child, early and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the 20 International Labour Organization, Making progress against child labour — Global estimates and trends 2000-2012 (Geneva, 2013). 4/13 corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls is underrecognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded as a result of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Taking note with appreciation of the adoption by the Human Rights Council of its resolution 24/23 of 27 September 2013 entitled “Strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage: challenges, achievements, best practices and implementation gaps”, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and child birth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their employment opportunities and their and their children’s quality of life and violates and impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation in the next generation, as reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/146 of 20 December 2012, remains unfinished business, Stressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources and technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs and priorities of child-headed households and women and girls at risk of or subjected to child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, 5/13 Emphasizing that increased access to education for young people, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination, including in respect of their access to education, health- care services and employment, and the importance of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this regard, 1. Stresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of the girl child as provided to her under human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,’ the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,’ the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? and the Optional Protocols thereto‘ as a matter of priority; 2. Urges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)?! and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)?2 of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 3. Urges all Governments and the United Nations system to strengthen efforts bilaterally and with international organizations and private sector donors in order to achieve the goals of the World Education Forum?? and to implement the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative, and calls for the reaffirmation and implementation of the commitments contained in the Education for All goals and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to gender and education; 4. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education, including communications and technology education, where available, for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive formal education, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurial training for young women and to tackle male and female stereotypes in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment, equitable compensation and decent work; 5. Calls upon States and the international community to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children and ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, improving the safety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring all schools are accessible, safe, secure and free from violence, and providing separate and adequate sanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families and children who become heads of households; 23 See United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Final Report of the World Education Forum, Dakar, Senegal, 26-28 April 2000 (Paris, 2000). 6/13 6. Calls upon States, with the support of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, as appropriate, to develop policies and programmes, giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education programmes, including age-appropriate sex education, with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, that support girls and enable them to acquire knowledge, develop self-esteem and take responsibility for their own lives, and to place special focus on programmes to educate women and men, especially parents, about the importance of girls’ physical and mental health and well-being; 7. Urges States to acknowledge the different needs of girls and boys during their childhood and adolescence and, as appropriate, to make differential investments that are responsive to their changing needs; 8. Calls upon all States, the United Nations system and civil society to take measures to address the obstacles that continue to affect the achievement of the goals set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action,’ as contained in paragraph 33 of the further actions and initiatives, including reviewing remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls in order to modify or abolish them and, where appropriate, strengthening national mechanisms to implement policies and programmes for the girl child and, in some cases, to enhance coordination among responsible institutions for the realization of the human rights of girls, including abolishing laws that discriminate against women and girls, and to mobilize all necessary resources and support in order to achieve those goals; 9. Urges States to strengthen efforts to urgently eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and, where applicable, to remain dedicated to the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto;?4 10. Also urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, in particular extreme poverty, deprived of nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-care services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, while a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is particularly threatening and harmful to the girl child, leaving her unable to enjoy her rights, to reach her full potential and to participate as a full member of society, with a particular focus on children living in child-headed households, including the child head of household; 11. Further urges States to ensure that the applicable requirements of the International Labour Organization for the employment of girls and boys are respected and effectively enforced and that girls who are employed have equal access to decent work, and equal payment and remuneration, are protected from economic and sexual exploitation, discrimination, sexual harassment, violence and abuse in the workplace, are aware of their rights and have access to formal and non-formal education, skills development and vocational training, and also urges States to develop gender-sensitive measures, including national action plans, where appropriate, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, hazardous forms of child labour, trafficking and slavery-like practices, including forced and bonded labour, and to recognize that girls, including in child- headed households, face greater risks in this regard; 7/13 12. Calls upon States, with the support of relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society, non-governmental organizations and community- based organizations, as appropriate, to take all measures necessary to ensure the right of girls to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health, and to develop sustainable health systems, strengthen existing ones to ensure primary health care with an integrated HIV response and make them more accessible to adolescent girls; 13. Urges all States to promote gender equality and equal access to basic social services, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, birth registration, health care, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the major causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream a gender perspective into all development policies and programmes, including those specific to the girl child; 14. Calls upon States to strengthen the capacity of national health systems, and in this regard calls upon the international community to assist national efforts, including by allocating adequate resources in order to provide essential services needed to prevent obstetric fistula and to treat those cases that occur by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care, to adolescent girls, including those living in poverty and in underserved rural areas where obstetric fistula is most common; 15. Urges all States to enact and strictly enforce laws ending child, early and forced marriage and ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses, to enact and strictly enforce laws concerning the minimum legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage, to raise the minimum age for marriage, engage all stakeholders, where necessary, and ensure that these laws to end child, early and forced marriage are well known, to further develop and implement comprehensive policies, plans of action and programmes for the survival, protection, development and advancement of the girl child in order to promote and protect the full enjoyment of her human rights, and to ensure equal opportunities for girls, including by making such plans an integral part of her total development process; 16. Calls upon States to support and implement, including with dedicated resources, multisectoral policies and programmes that end the practice of child, early and forced marriage and ensure the provision of viable alternatives and institutional support, especially educational opportunities for girls, with an emphasis on keeping girls in school through post-primary education, including those who are already married or pregnant, ensuring physical access to education, including by increasing financial incentives to families, promoting the empowerment of girls, improving educational quality, ensuring safe and hygienic conditions in schools, and, where applicable, establishing safe residential facilities; 17. Urges States to ensure that the rights of children in child-headed households are respected and that the heads of such households have full enjoyment of all the rights of the child, and to further ensure that children in child-headed households, particularly girls, receive the support they need to ensure their continued attendance in school consistent with their age; 8/13 18. Also urges States to ensure that efforts to enact and implement legislation to protect, support and empower child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, include provisions to ensure their economic well-being, access to health-care services, nutrition, clean water and sanitation, shelter and education, and inheritance, and that the family is protected and assisted in staying together; 19. Calls upon States to put in place concrete measures to ensure that while children heading households, especially girls, exercise all the rights of the child, they also receive appropriate assistance to enable them to fulfil their de facto responsibilities as household heads by ensuring and protecting their property and inheritance rights; 20. Also calls upon States to include an integrated approach in supporting and empowering child-headed households, given the mental and psychosocial trauma, stigma and physical and economic stress children may experience as a result of becoming heads of households at a very young age; 21. Urges States to forge partnerships with relevant stakeholders, particularly by working with and involving communities in developing programmes and mechanisms designed to ensure the safety, protection and empowerment of children, especially girls, in child-headed households as well as to ensure that they receive the support they need from their community; 22. Calls upon States to strengthen research on families and household formation and structure, with a particular emphasis on the existence of de facto child-headed households and the long-term economic and psychological impact that being a child head of household or a child raised by another child has on the children and on social sustainability; 23. Also calls upon States to strengthen research, data collection and analysis on the girl child, disaggregated by household structure, sex, age, disability status, economic situation and marital status and geographical location, in order to provide a better understanding of the situations of girls, especially of the multiple forms of discrimination that they face, and to inform the development of necessary policies and programme responses, which should take a holistic age-appropriate approach to addressing the full range of the forms of discrimination that girls may face, in order to protect their rights effectively; 24. Urges States to take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment by girls with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, to adopt, implement and strengthen appropriate policies and programmes designed to address their needs, and to take into account the conclusions contained in the outcome document adopted at the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities, held on 23 September 2013; 25 25. Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence, discrimination and exploitation in all settings, including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection, female genital mutilation, rape, domestic violence, incest, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, child prostitution and child pornography, trafficking and forced migration, forced labour and child, early and 9/13 forced marriage, and to develop age-appropriate safe, confidential and disability- accessible programmes and medical, social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence and discrimination; 26. Calls upon all States to enact and enforce the necessary legislative or other measures, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and the media, to prevent the distribution over the Internet of child pornography, including depictions of child sexual abuse, ensuring that adequate mechanisms are in place to enable reporting and removal of such material and that its creators, distributors and collectors are prosecuted, as appropriate; 27. Urges States to formulate comprehensive, miultidisciplinary and coordinated national plans, programmes or strategies to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, which should have dedicated resources, be widely disseminated and provide targets and timetables for implementation, as well as effective domestic enforcement procedures through the establishment of monitoring mechanisms involving all parties concerned, including consultations with women’s organizations, giving attention to the recommendations relating to the girl child of the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Violence against Children; 28. Also urges States to ensure that children who are capable of forming their own views have the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting them, with the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, and ensure that this right is fully and equally enjoyed by the girl child, and to involve girl children, including those with special needs, as well as girls with disabilities, and their representative organizations in decision-making processes, as appropriate, and to include them as full partners in identifying their own needs and in developing, planning, implementing and assessing policies and programmes to meet those needs; 29. Recognizes that a considerable number of girl children are particularly vulnerable, including orphans, children living on the street, internally displaced and refugee children, children affected by trafficking and sexual and economic exploitation, children living with or affected by HIV and AIDS, and children who are incarcerated, or who live without parental support, and therefore urges States, with the support of the international community, where relevant, to take appropriate measures to address the needs of such children by implementing national policies and strategies to build and strengthen governmental, community and family capacities to provide a supportive environment for such children, including by providing appropriate counselling and psychosocial support, and ensuring their safety, enrolment in school and access to shelter, good nutrition and health and social services on an equal basis with other children; 30. Encourages States to promote actions, including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance, for the social reintegration of children in difficult situations, in particular girls, considering, inter alia, views, skills and capacities that those children have developed in the conditions in which they lived and, where appropriate, with their meaningful participation; 10/13 31. Urges all States and the international community to respect, promote and protect the rights of the girl child, taking into account the particular vulnerabilities of the girl child in pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict situations, and in natural disasters as well as in other humanitarian emergencies, all of which may result in the creation of child-headed households, and further urges States to take special measures for the protection of girls, in all phases of humanitarian emergencies from relief to recovery, and in particular to protect them from sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection, gender-based violence, including rape, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, torture, abduction, trafficking and forced labour, paying special attention to refugee and displaced girls, and to take into account their special needs in disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation assistance and reintegration processes; 32. Deplores all cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of women and girls in humanitarian crises, including those cases involving humanitarian workers and peacekeepers, and urges States to take effective measures to address gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies and to make all possible efforts to ensure that their laws and institutions are adequate to prevent, promptly investigate and prosecute acts of gender-based violence; 33. Also deplores all acts of sexual exploitation, abuse of and trafficking in women and children by military, police and civilian personnel involved in United Nations operations, welcomes the efforts undertaken by United Nations agencies and peacekeeping operations to implement a zero-tolerance policy in this regard, and requests the Secretary-General and personnel-contributing countries to continue to take all appropriate action necessary to combat these abuses by such personnel, including through the full implementation without delay of those measures adopted in the relevant General Assembly resolutions based on recommendations of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations; 2° 34. Urges Member States, the United Nations and other international, regional and subregional organizations, as well as civil society, including non-governmental organizations, the private sector and the media, to fully and effectively implement the relevant provisions of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons?” and the activities outlined therein, and expresses its view that it will, inter alia, contribute to the promotion of the rights of girls and enhance cooperation and a better coordination of efforts in fighting trafficking in persons and promote increased ratification and full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime2® and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; ?9 35. Calls upon Member States to devise, enforce and strengthen effective child- and youth-sensitive measures to combat, eliminate and prosecute all forms of trafficking in women and girls, including for sexual and economic exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy within wider efforts to eliminate all 26 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-ninth Session, Supplement No. 19 (A/59/19/Rev.1). 11/13 forms of violence against women and girls, including by taking effective measures against the criminalization of girls who are victims of exploitation and ensuring that girls who have been exploited receive access to the necessary psychosocial support; 36. Calls upon Governments, civil society, including the media, and non-governmental organizations to promote human rights education and full respect for and the enjoyment of the human rights of the girl child, inter alia, through the translation, production and dissemination of age-appropriate and gender-sensitive information material on those rights to all sectors of society, in particular to children; 37. Requests the Secretary-General, as Chair of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, to ensure that all organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, individually and collectively, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the World Health Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Labour Organization, take into account the rights and the particular needs of the girl child in country programmes of cooperation in accordance with national priorities, including through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework; 38. Requests all human rights treaty bodies and the human rights mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, including the special procedures, to adopt regularly and systematically a gender perspective in the implementation of their mandates and to include in their reports information on the qualitative analysis of violations of the human rights of women and girls, and encourages the strengthening of cooperation and coordination in that regard; 39. Requests States to ensure that, in all policies and programmes designed to provide comprehensive HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support, particular attention and support are given to the girl child at risk, living with or affected by HIV, including pregnant girls and young and adolescent mothers and girls with disabilities, and child heads of households with a view to achieving Millennium Development Goal 6, in particular to halt and begin to reverse by 2015 the spread of HIV; 40. Invites States to promote initiatives aimed at reducing the prices of antiretroviral drugs, especially second-line drugs, available to the girl child, including bilateral and private sector initiatives as well as initiatives on a voluntary basis taken by groups of States, including those based on innovative financing mechanisms that contribute to the mobilization of resources for social development, including those that aim to provide further access to drugs at affordable prices to developing countries on a sustainable and predictable basis, and in this regard takes note of the International Drug Purchase Facility, UNITAID; 41. Calls upon all States to integrate food and nutritional support with the goal that children, especially girl children, have access at all times to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences, for an active and healthy life; 12/13 42. Calls upon States to ensure that social protection programmes, including HIV-sensitive programmes, are provided to orphans and other vulnerable children, with particular attention to addressing the needs and vulnerabilities of girl children and protecting their rights; 43. Urges States and the international community to increase resources at all levels, particularly in the education and health sectors, so as to enable young people, especially girls, to gain the knowledge, attitudes and life skills that they need to overcome their challenges, including the prevention of HIV infection and early pregnancy, and to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health; 44. Stresses the need to strengthen the commitment of States and the United Nations system in their responsibility to mainstream the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, in particular the girl child, into the development agenda at the national, regional and international levels, including in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; 45.

from which such assets are derived, and emphasizing the critical importance of effective domestic investigative efforts and international cooperation to overcome such difficulties, Recalling article 56 of the Convention encouraging each State party to endeavour to take measures to permit it to forward, without prejudice to its own investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings, information on proceeds of offences established in accordance with the Convention to another State party without prior request, when it considers that the disclosure of such information might assist the receiving

necessary legal framework and allocating the necessary resources, Concerned that some persons accused of crimes of corruption have managed to escape justice and thus have eluded the legal consequences of their actions, and have been successful in hiding their assets, Taking into account the need to hold corrupt officials accountable by depriving them of their stolen assets, Stressing the critical importance of mobilizing political will for effective implementation of chapter V of the Convention, Calling upon all States parties, acting as both requested and requesting States, to continue to commit the political will to act together to recover the proceeds of corruption and to work together to overcome obstacles to effective asset recovery, Determined to prevent, detect and deter in a
