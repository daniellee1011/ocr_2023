Considers it intolerable that there are around 852 million undernourished people in the world, that every five seconds a child under the age of five dies, directly or indirectly, of hunger or hunger-related disease somewhere in the world and that one person loses his/her eyesight every four minutes as a result of a lack of vitamin A when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to provide 2,100 kilocalories per person per day to 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality, that in many countries gitls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition and, in that sense, encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate; 5.

Reaffirming its commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming also the commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments relating to human rights, and international law, Stressing that all peoples have the right to self-determination, by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development, Recognizing that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, Recalling that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming the commitment made by Member States to strive for the full protection and promotion in all our States of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for all, Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for a democratic, participatory and fair international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including promoting and encouraging respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, rule of law, pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity, Recognizing that granting all people formal political equality does not create an equal capacity to participate in political processes, or an equal capacity to influence decision-making processes, taking into consideration the existence of threats and obstacles that impede effective popular participation, Welcoming the commitment of all Member States, expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to work collectively for more inclusive political processes allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all countries, Welcoming also the pledge of the international community at the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna in June 1993, to support the strengthening and promotion of democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world, Recalling the commitment of States, expressed in the Declaration of Principles adopted by the World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003, to ensure that everyone can benefit from the opportunities offered by

of all individuals and peoples in the formation of just, equitable, democratic and inclusive societies can contribute to a world free from racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Emphasizing the importance of the equitable participation of all, without any discrimination, in domestic as well as global decision-making, Considering that in the current context of globalization, whereby decisions affecting people’s lives are often taken outside the national context, the application of the principles of democracy to the international and regional levels has taken on added importance, Recognizing that development can only be sustainable on a long-term basis if development policies are responsive to people’s needs and ensure people’s participation both in their design and implementation, while stressing the fact that meeting the basic human needs essential for survival is a sine qua non condition for an effective democracy, Emphasizing that poverty, inequalities and discrimination constitute major threats to democracy and inhibit the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and the participation of all citizens in the democratic processes in every society, Emphasizing also that the full participation of everyone in democratic societies fosters and enhances the struggle against poverty, inequities and discrimination, Recognizing that the electoral regime is a basic and fundamental element of democracy, but that democracy involves more than the mere holding of elections, as it also depends on an effective response to people’s well-being, Reaffirming the need to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty, Recalling that accountable and transparent governance at the national and international levels is critical for the creation of an environment that facilitates the development of democratic, prosperous and peaceful societies, Reaffirming that democracy goes hand in hand with an effective, honest and transparent government, freely chosen and accountable for its management of public affairs, Noting that the conduct of public affairs covers all aspects of public administration and the formulation and implementation of policy at the international, regional, national and local levels, Recognizing and respecting the rich and diverse nature of the community of the world’s democracies, which arise out of all of the world’s social, cultural and religious beliefs and traditions, Bearing in mind that each society and every context has its own indigenous and relevant democratic institutional traditions, and that while no single institution can claim democratic perfection, the combination of domestic democratic structures with universal democratic norms is a formidable tool in strengthening both the roots and the reach of democracy and in advancing a universal understanding of democracy, Recognizing that while all democracies share common features, differences between democratic societies should be neither feared nor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity, Aware of the importance of fostering a diversity of social contributions in strengthening people’s participation, equity, social justice and non-discrimination, including the enhancement of non-governmental organizations, people’s organizations, voluntary social organizations, trade unions, the private sector and other actors of civil society, Aware also of the importance of ensuring the implementation of the rights to freedom of opinion and expression as well as to freedom of assembly and association, in accordance with articles 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Recalling the commitment undertaken by all States within the framework of the United Nations and other international organizations to work for the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, 1. Declares that popular participation, equity, social justice and non-discrimination are essential foundations of democracy; 2. Reaffirms that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives and that in that context the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international levels should be universal and conducted without conditions attached; 3. Also reaffirms that while all democracies share common features, there is no one model of democracy; therefore we must not seek to export any particular model of democracy; 4. Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone, both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development; 5.

Stresses that the consolidation of democracy requires that sustained economic growth and sustainable development of countries and communities foster the promotion and consolidation of democracies; 8. Declares that full popular participation is only feasible if societies have democratic political and electoral systems which guarantee to all their citizens the possibility both to take part in the government of their country, directly or through freely chosen representatives, and to have equal access to public service, without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status; 9. Reaffirms that the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government and that this shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections, which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures; 10.

Also urges all States to take measures to eliminate obstacles and threats to democracy and to ensure that barriers to participation, such as illiteracy, poverty and discrimination, are overcome; 15. 16. Requests all States and the international community further to endeavour to promote effective measures to eradicate poverty and promote just, equitable and inclusive societies; 16. 17.

A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 Annex Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice We, the States Members of the United Nations, Having assembled at the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held in Bangkok from 18 to 25 April 2005, to decide to take more effective concerted action, in a spirit of cooperation, to combat crime and seek justice, Convinced that the United Nations congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice, which constitute a major intergovernmental forum, have contributed to national policies and practices by facilitating the exchange of views and experience, mobilizing public opinion and recommending policy options at the national, regional and international levels, thus making a significant contribution to progress and the promotion of international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice, Recalling the work of the ten previous United Nations congresses, Reaffirming the responsibility vested in the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme to work, together with Member States and regional and international organizations, in the fields of crime prevention and criminal justice, Greatly concerned by the expansion and dimensions of transnational organized crime, including illicit drug trafficking, money-laundering, trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, illegal arms trafficking and terrorism, and any existing links between them, and by the increasing sophistication and diversification of the activities of organized criminal groups, Emphasizing that enhancing dialogue among civilizations, promoting tolerance, preventing the indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures and addressing development issues and unresolved conflicts will contribute to international cooperation, which is among the most important elements to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and reaffirming that no terrorist act can be justified in any circumstances, Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law and should adopt such measures in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Alarmed by the rapid growth, geographical extent and effects of new economic and financial crimes, which have emerged as significant threats to national economies and the international financial system, Highlighting the need for an integrated and systemic approach to combating corruption and money-laundering, within existing frameworks and instruments, in particular those under the aegis of the United Nations, since those crimes can be conducive to the perpetration of other criminal activities, A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 Noting with appreciation the work of the regional preparatory meetings for the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,3 Declare as follows: 1. We proclaim our political will and commitment to achieve the aspirations and objectives as set out in this Declaration. 2. We reaffirm our continued support for and commitment to the United Nations and to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, especially the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and the institutes of the Programme network, and resolve to strengthen the Programme further through sustained funding, as appropriate. 3. In a spirit of common and shared responsibility, we reaffirm our readiness to seek to improve international cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism, at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels, in areas including extradition and mutual legal assistance. We seek to ensure our national capacity and, where appropriate, the coherence of our international capacity, through the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations, to engage in international cooperation, in particular in the prevention, investigation, prosecution and adjudication of transnational organized crime and terrorism and in discovering any existing links between them. 4. We welcome the entry into force of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two of its Protocols.# We call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to ratify or accede to and implement the provisions of that Convention and its Protocols, as well as the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption> and the international instruments against terrorism. In implementing the provisions of those instruments, we commit ourselves to full compliance with our obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. We support every effort to facilitate the implementation of those instruments. 5. We call upon donor States and financial institutions to continue to make adequate voluntary contributions on a regular basis for the provision of technical assistance to developing countries and to countries with economies in transition, in order to help build their capacity to prevent and tackle crime in all its forms and apply the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice and, in particular, to facilitate their becoming parties to and implementing the international instruments against terrorism and the relevant international instruments against crime, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the international drug control conventions. 6. We support a more integrated approach within the United Nations in relation to the provision of assistance for building capacity in crime prevention and 3 A/CONF.203/RPM.1/1, A/CONF.203/RPM.2/1, A/CONF.203/RPM.3/1 and Corr.1 and A/CONF.203/RPM.4/1. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 criminal justice, and in cooperation in criminal matters of a transnational character, as a contribution to the establishment and strengthening of the rule of law. 7. We seek to improve our responses to crime and terrorism nationally and internationally, inter alia, by collecting and sharing information on crime and terrorism and on effective countermeasures, in accordance with national legislation. We welcome the important work done by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network in the area of trends in crime and justice. 8. We are convinced that upholding the rule of law and good governance and proper management of public affairs and public property at the local, national and international levels are prerequisites for creating and sustaining an environment for successfully preventing and combating crime. We are committed to the development and maintenance of fair and efficient criminal justice institutions, including the humane treatment of all those in pre-trial and correctional facilities, in accordance with applicable international standards. 9. We recognize the role of individuals and groups outside the public sector, such as civil society, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, in contributing to the prevention of and the fight against crime and terrorism. We encourage measures to strengthen this role within the rule of law. 10. We recognize that comprehensive and effective crime prevention strategies can significantly reduce crime and victimization. We urge that such strategies address the root causes and risk factors of crime and victimization and that they be further developed and implemented at the local, national and international levels, taking into account, inter alia, the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime.® 11. We note that countries emerging from conflicts are particularly vulnerable to crime, in particular organized crime and corruption, and therefore we recommend that Member States, regional organizations and international entities such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in coordination with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat and other relevant entities, provide more effective responses to these problems, in order to re-establish, strengthen or sustain the rule of law and deliver justice in post-conflict situations. 12. With regard to the increased involvement of organized criminal groups in the theft of and trafficking in cultural property and illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna, we recognize the importance of combating these forms of crime and, bearing in mind the relevant international legal instruments, such as the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property,” the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora® and the Convention on Biological Diversity,” we call upon Member States to take effective measures to strengthen international cooperation. 6 Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. 7 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 823, No. 11806. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 13. We note with concern the rise of kidnapping and trafficking in persons as serious, profitable and inhumane forms of organized crime, often committed with the objective of funding criminal organizations and, in some cases, terrorist activities, and hence recommend that measures be devised to combat these crimes and that attention be given to the creation of practical mechanisms for countering them. We recognize the need to implement measures intended to provide adequate assistance and protection to victims of kidnapping and trafficking in persons and their families. 14. Mindful of General Assembly resolution 59/156 of 20 December 2004 on preventing, combating and punishing trafficking in human organs, we note the serious concerns raised about the illicit removal of and trafficking in human organs and will examine with interest the report of the Secretary-General requested in that resolution. 15. We reaffirm the fundamental importance of implementation of existing instruments and the further development of national measures and international cooperation in criminal matters, such as consideration of strengthening and augmenting measures, in particular against cybercrime, money-laundering and trafficking in cultural property, as well as on extradition, mutual legal assistance and the confiscation, recovery and return of proceeds of crime. 16. We note that, in the current period of globalization, information technology and the rapid development of new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the abuse of those technologies for criminal purposes. We therefore welcome efforts to enhance and supplement existing cooperation to prevent, investigate and prosecute high-technology and computer-related crime, including by developing partnerships with the private sector. We recognize the important contribution of the United Nations to regional and other international forums in the fight against cybercrime and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking into account that experience, to examine the feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the United Nations in partnership with other similarly focused organizations. 17. We recognize the importance of giving special attention to the need to protect witnesses and victims of crime and terrorism, and we commit ourselves to strengthening, where needed, the legal and financial framework for providing support to such victims, taking into account, inter alia, the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power.10 18. We call upon Member States to take steps, in accordance with their domestic laws, to promote access to justice, to consider the provision of legal aid to those who need it and to enable the effective assertion of their rights in the criminal justice system. 19. We note with concern the problem of trafficking in illicit drugs and the serious socio-economic consequences it entails, and therefore we call for the strengthening of international cooperation in combating that form of organized crime. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 20. We will strengthen international cooperation in order to create an environment that is conducive to the fight against crime, including by promoting growth and sustainable development and eradicating poverty and unemployment through effective and balanced development strategies and crime prevention policies. 21. We call upon States that have not yet done so to become parties to and implement the universal instruments against terrorism. In order to enhance the capacity of States to become parties to and implement those instruments and to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism, we express our support for the continuing efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, within its mandate and in coordination with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate of the Security Council, to assist States in their efforts to ratify and implement those instruments, through the provision of technical assistance upon request. This might include assistance to criminal justice systems to facilitate the effective implementation of those instruments. 22. We express the hope that the ongoing negotiation of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism will be concluded as soon as possible. In this context, we recognize that arriving at a possible definition of terrorism is one of the key issues to be resolved. We call upon Member States to consider signing and ratifying the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.!! 23. We are convinced that the expeditious entry into force and subsequent implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption!2 are central to the efforts at the international level to fight corruption, and therefore we accord high priority to supporting efforts to that end, and we call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to sign, ratify or accede to it. 24. We are also convinced that the proper management of public affairs and public property and the rule of law are essential to the prevention and control of corruption, including, inter alia, through effective measures for its investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, we recognize that, in order to curb corruption, it is necessary to promote a culture of integrity and accountability in both the public and the private sector. 25. We are convinced that asset recovery is one of the essential components of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and, for that reason, we emphasize the need to adopt measures to facilitate asset recovery that are consistent with the principles of that convention. 26. We are conscious of the challenge of investigating and prosecuting complex cases involving economic and financial crimes, including money- laundering. We call upon Member States to strengthen policies, measures and institutions for national action and international cooperation in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic and financial crimes, including money- laundering, and such crimes conducted via, or facilitated by, information technologies, in particular in connection with the financing of terrorism and trafficking in illicit drugs. 11 General Assembly resolution 59/290, annex. 12 General Assembly resolution 58/4, annex. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 27. We are conscious of the crucial importance of tackling document and identity fraud in order to curb organized crime and terrorism. We seek to improve international cooperation, including through technical assistance, to combat document and identity fraud, in particular the fraudulent use of travel documents, through improved security measures, and encourage the adoption of appropriate national legislation. 28. We recommend that voluntary contributions and appropriate technical assistance be made available to developing countries, to strengthen their capacity in order to support their efforts to fight economic and financial crimes effectively. 29. As appropriate, we endeavour to use and apply the United Nations standards and norms in our national programmes for crime prevention and criminal justice reform and to undertake, as needed, efforts to ensure their wider dissemination. We endeavour to facilitate appropriate training for law enforcement officials, including prison officials, prosecutors, the judiciary and other relevant professional groups, taking into account those norms and standards and best practices at the international level. 30. We recommend that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice give consideration to reviewing the adequacy of standards and norms in relation to prison management and prisoners. 31. We note with concern that the physical and social conditions associated with imprisonment may facilitate the spread of HIV/AIDS in pre-trial and correctional facilities and thus in society, thereby presenting a critical prison management problem; we call upon States to develop and adopt measures and guidelines, where appropriate and in accordance with national legislation, to ensure that the particular problems of HIV/AIDS are adequately addressed in such facilities. 32. To promote the interests of victims and the rehabilitation of offenders, we recognize the importance of further developing restorative justice policies, procedures and programmes that include alternatives to prosecution, thereby avoiding possible adverse effects of imprisonment, helping to decrease the caseload of criminal courts and promoting the incorporation of restorative justice approaches into criminal justice systems, as appropriate. 33. We affirm our determination to pay particular attention to juvenile justice. We will consider ways to ensure the provision of services to children who are victims of crime and children in conflict with law, in particular those deprived of their liberty, and to ensure that those services take into account their gender, social circumstances and developmental needs and the relevant United Nations standards and norms, as appropriate. 34. We stress the need to consider measures to prevent the expansion of urban crime, including by improving international cooperation and capacity- building for law enforcement and the judiciary in that area and by promoting the involvement of local authorities and civil society. 35. We express our profound gratitude to the people and the Government of Thailand for their warm and generous hospitality towards the participants and for the excellent facilities provided for the Eleventh Congress.",10/18/2005,2005_558873,Madagascar,N/A,yes

Considers it intolerable that every five seconds a child under the age of 5 dies from hunger or hunger-related diseases somewhere in the world, that there are about 854 million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 5. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 6. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 7.

Stresses also the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands; and in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 10. Acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 11. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 12.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 17. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, A/C.3/61/L.27 while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 19. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently occurring across Africa; 20.

Recalls General Comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant),!! in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture in realization of the right to adequate food; 26.
