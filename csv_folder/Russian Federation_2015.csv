of international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming that terrorism in all forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to

implementation of relevant resolutions, in particular Security Council resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) as key instruments in the fight against terrorism, Recalling its Resolutions 1267 (1999),

strategies with national action by Member States, Reaffirming the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic of Iraq and the Syrian Arab Republic, and reaffirming further the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming also that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, or civilization, Stressing that terrorism can only be defeated by a sustained and comprehensive approach involving the active participation and collaboration of all States, and international and regional organizations to impede, impair, isolate and incapacitate the terrorist threat, Expressing, in this regard, its deep appreciation for Arab League Resolution 7804 (7 September 2014), the Paris Statement (15 September 2014), the FATF statement on countering the financing of ISIL (24 October 2014) and the Manama declaration on countering terrorist finance (9 November 2014), Reaffirming its resolution 1373 (2001) and in particular its decisions that all States shall prevent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts and refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts, including by suppressing recruitment of members of terrorist groups and eliminating the supply of weapons to terrorists, Recognizing the significant need to build capacities of Member States to counter terrorism and terrorist finance, Reiterating its deep concern that oilfields and their related infrastructure, as well as other infrastructure such as dams and power plants, controlled by ISIL, ANF and potentially other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, are generating a significant portion of the groups’ income, alongside extortion, private foreign donations, kidnap ransoms and stolen money from the territory they control, which support their recruitment efforts and strengthen their operational capability to organize and carry out terrorist attacks, Condemning in the strongest terms abductions of women and children, expressing outrage at their exploitation and abuse, including rape, sexual abuse, forced marriage, committed by ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and encouraging all state and non-state actors with evidence to bring it to the

refineries and related material, other natural resources including precious metals such as gold, silver, and copper, diamonds, and any other assets are made available to ISIL, ANF, and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, and noting that direct or indirect trade with ISIL and ANF in such materials could constitute a violation of the obligations imposed by resolution 2161 (2014), Reminding all States of their obligation to ensure that any person who participates in the financing, planning, preparation or perpetration of terrorist acts or in

It is at present the only intergovernmental organization that specializes in civil defence and protection of civilians at the international level. It operates on the basis of its Constitution, an international agreement adopted on 17 October 1966. Under the Constitution, the Organization’s core functions are: — To promote the development of governmental bodies and mechanisms for the protection of people, property and the environment in the event of natural and man-made disasters. — To bring together national civil defence services, including search and rescue units, and to develop cooperation, exchanges and coordination among them. The International Civil Defence Organization provides them with technical and advisory support and develops and implements relevant training programmes. Members Under article 3 of the Constitution, “Membership in the Organization shall be open to all States”. Any country that accepts the Constitution may join the Organization. States can also obtain observer status, which entitles them to take part in all activities of the Organization. The Organization currently has 54 member States. There are 19 countries with observer status. The Organization also has 30 associate members, including some international organizations. The member States, observers and associate members represent all regions of the world. Structure, management and financing The highest body of the Organization is its General Assembly, which is composed of delegates from member States. The Executive Council of the Organization is responsible for implementing the decisions of the General Assembly and guiding the work of the Organization. The Organization has a permanent secretariat that provides administrative and technical support. The secretariat is headed by a Secretary-General elected for a four-year term. In accordance with article 42 of the Constitution, the expenditures of the Organization are apportioned among the members in accordance with a scale fixed by the Assembly. 3. Aims and activities The main priorities and spheres of activity of the Organization are reflected in the strategic development programme. An important provision of that programme is improved engagement with the United Nations and other international organizations 2/4 A/70/191 on the basis of new forms of cooperation in the area of improving preparedness for the protection of people and the environment. The Organization has ongoing communication with international partners, including the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat, the Consultative Group on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets, the Civil-Military Coordination Section, the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team, the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group, the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the secretariat of the Partial Agreement of the Council of Europe, as well as other associate members, in particular the Council of Arab Ministers of the Interior. Observer status in the General Assembly of the United Nations The General Assembly of the United Nations, by its decision 49/426, decided that the granting of observer status should be confined to States and to those intergovernmental organizations whose activities cover matters of interest to the Assembly. The International Civil Defence Organization is an intergovernmental organization, having been established as such on the basis of its Constitution, a multilateral agreement adopted on 17 October 1966. The Organization is financed by its member States, which are States Members of the United Nations. The aims of the General Assembly of the United Nations and those of the International Civil Defence Organization with regard to the formulation and implementation of effective measures to protect and ensure human security in the face of today’s shifting challenges and threats are complementary.

Collaboration between the International Civil Defence Organization and relevant United Nations entities on a regular and systematic basis will foster a new image of civil defence. Granting observer status in the General Assembly to the International Civil Defence Organization would further strengthen mutually beneficial institutional dialogue between that Organization and the United Nations and would expand the capacity of both institutions to promote peace and security and develop effective cooperation in the field of humanitarian response. 3/4 A/70/191 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the International Civil Defence Organization in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Wishing to promote cooperation between the United Nations and the International Civil Defence Organization, 1.
