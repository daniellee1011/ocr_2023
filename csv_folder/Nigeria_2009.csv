Trafficking in persons, especially women and children","The Human Rights Council, Reaffirming all previous resolutions on the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in particular General Assembly resolutions 63/156 and 63/194 of 18 December 2008, and also its resolution 8/12 of 18 June 2008, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Reaffirming the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto, Recalling the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the Convention, and recalling the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as their origins, and that these forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Recognizing also that trafficking in persons violates human rights and impairs the enjoyment of them, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for it to be eradicated, Bearing in mind that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, Recognizing the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, Recognizing also the challenges to combating trafficking in persons, especially women and children, owing to the lack of adequate legislation and implementation of existing legislation, the lack of availability of reliable sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics and the lack of resources, Noting that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by trafficking in persons in some parts of the world, Recognizing that policies and programmes for prevention, rehabilitation, return and reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, transit and destination, Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, presented to the Council at its tenth session, Taking note with appreciation also of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the latest developments within the United Nations relating to combating trafficking in persons and on the relevant activities of the Office, and taking note of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, presented to the Council at its tenth session, Taking note of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime Open-ended Interim Working Group on Trafficking in Persons, held in Vienna on 14 and 15 April 2009, and the recommendations resulting therefrom, and the interactive dialogue on the theme “Taking collective action to end human trafficking” of the General Assembly, held on 13 May 2009, which included a discussion on the advisability of a global plan of action against human trafficking, Welcoming especially the efforts of Governments, United Nations bodies and agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Recognizing the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee against Torture at the persistence of trafficking and the vulnerability of victims to human rights violations, 1. Affirms that it is essential to place the protection of human rights at the centre of measures taken to prevent and end trafficking in persons, and to protect, assist and provide access to adequate redress to victims, including the possibility of obtaining compensation from the perpetrators; Reiterates its concern at: (a) The high number of people, especially women and children, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, who are being trafficked to developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States; (b) The increasing activities of transnational and national organized crime and others who profit from trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard for dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international law and contrary to international standards; (c) The use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for the purposes of exploitation of the prostitution of others and other forms of sexual exploitation, for trafficking in women as brides and for sex tourism, for child pornography, paedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation of children; (d) The high level of impunity enjoyed by traffickers and their accomplices and the denial of rights and justice to victims of trafficking; Urges Governments: (a) To take appropriate measures to address the root factors, including external factors, that encourage trafficking in persons for prostitution and other forms of commercialized sex, forced marriages and forced labour, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs, including by strengthening existing legislation or by considering the enactment of anti-trafficking legislation and the adoption of national plans of action; (b) To criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms and to condemn and penalize traffickers, facilitators and intermediaries, including, where applicable, by imposing sanctions against legal entities involved in the process of trafficking, without making accusations by, or the participation of, the victims of trafficking a precondition to the prosecution of trafficking; (c) To ensure protection and assistance to the victims of trafficking with full respect for their human rights, including, where appropriate, through legislation; (d) To provide resources, as appropriate, for the comprehensive protection and assistance to victims of trafficking, including access to adequate social, necessary medical and psychological care and services, including those related to HIV/AIDS, as well as shelter, legal assistance in a language that they can understand and helplines, and to cooperate in this regard, as appropriate, with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations; (e) To take all appropriate measures to ensure that victims of trafficking are not penalized for being trafficked and that they do not suffer from revictimization as a result of actions taken by Government authorities, bearing in mind that they are victims of exploitation, and encourages Governments to provide trafficked persons with access to specialized support and assistance, regardless of their immigration status; (f) To devise, enforce and strengthen effective gender- and age-sensitive measures to combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking, especially in women and children, including for sexual and labour exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy that integrates a human rights perspective, and to draw up, as appropriate, national plans of action in this regard; (g) To adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures to discourage the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons and leads to trafficking in persons, including the demand created by sex tourism, especially in children, and forced labour, and to enhance, in this regard, preventive measures, including legislative measures, to deter exploiters of trafficked persons and to ensure their accountability; (h) To establish mechanisms, where appropriate, in cooperation with the international community, to combat the use of the Internet to facilitate trafficking in persons and crimes related to sexual or other forms of exploitation, and to strengthen international cooperation to investigate and prosecute trafficking facilitated by the use of the Internet; (i) To provide or strengthen training for law enforcement, immigration, criminal justice and other relevant officials, including personnel participating in peacekeeping operations, in preventing and responding effectively to trafficking in persons, including the identification and treatment of victims with full respect for their human rights; (¥j) To conduct information campaigns for the general public, including children, aimed at promoting awareness of the dangers associated with all forms of trafficking and at encouraging the public, including the victims of trafficking themselves, to report on instances of trafficking; (k) To support allocation of the necessary resources, as appropriate, in cooperation with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to strengthen preventive action, in particular education for women and men, as well as for girls and boys, on the human rights of women and children, gender equality, self-respect and mutual respect; (2) To consider setting up or strengthening a national coordinating mechanism, for example, a national rapporteur or an inter-agency body, with the participation of civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to encourage the exchange of information and to report on data, root causes, factors and trends in trafficking; (m) To enhance information-sharing and data-collection capacities as a way of promoting cooperation to combat trafficking in persons, including through the systematic collection of sex- and age-disagegregated data; (n) To enhance cooperation with each other and with relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to ensure effective prevention and countering of trafficking in people, and to consider strengthening existing regional cooperation and mechanisms aimed at combating trafficking in persons or to establish such mechanisms where they do not exist; (0) Toconsider signing and ratifying, as a matter of priority, in the case of Governments that have not yet done so, and for States parties to implement relevant United Nations legal instruments, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children supplementing the Convention, and to take immediate steps to incorporate provisions of the Protocol into domestic legal systems; 4. Calls upon all Governments to continue to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and to consider responding favourably to requests to visit their countries, and to provide all necessary information related to the mandate to enable the mandate holder to fulfil the duties of the mandate effectively and, in this regard, expresses its appreciation to the large number of Governments that provided responses to the initial questionnaire on trafficking developed by the Special Rapporteur; 5. Invites Governments to include information on measures and best practices to combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children, in their national reports submitted for the universal periodic review; 6. Encourages Governments to take into account, as a useful tool to integrate a human rights-based approach, the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking (E/2002/68/Add.1) developed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, including, as appropriate, in the formulation, review and implementation of legislation, policies and programmes aimed at preventing and eradicating trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and providing assistance to victims; 7. Encourages the Office of the High Commissioner to provide or to support, within existing resources, training at the national level for all stakeholders on the integration of a human rights approach into the prevention and response to trafficking in persons, including the identification and treatment of victims with full respect for their human rights; 8. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to enhance its efforts within the Inter-Agency Coordination Group against Trafficking to promote and integrate a human rights-based approach into efforts to combat human trafficking; 9. Also requests the Office of the High Commissioner to organize, within existing resources, and in close coordination with the Special Rapporteur, a two-day seminar aimed at identifying opportunities and challenges in the development of rights-based responses to trafficking in persons with a view to acknowledging emerging good practices and further promoting the practical application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, with the participation of Governments, the Special Rapporteur and other relevant special procedures, treaty bodies, United Nations specialized agencies and programmes, regional, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions, academics, medical experts and representatives of victims, and to submit a report on the proceedings of the seminar to the Council; 10.

deeply concerned over the lack of progress on the issue of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict in particular against women and children, notably against girls, and noting as documented in the Secretary-General’s report that sexual violence occurs in armed conflicts throughout the world, Reiterating deep concern that, despite its repeated condemnation of violence against women and children including all forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, and despite its calls addressed to all parties to armed conflict for the cessation of such acts with immediate effect, such acts continue to occur, and in some situations have become systematic or widespread, Recalling the commitments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (A/52/231) as well as those contained in the outcome document of the twenty-third Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly entitled “Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty-First Century”

and special protection due to the fact that they can be placed particularly at risk, Recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious crimes perpetrated against civilians, and in this regard, noting with concern that only limited numbers of perpetrators of sexual violence have been brought to justice, while recognizing that in conflict and in post conflict situations national justice systems may be significantly weakened, Reaffirming that ending impunity is essential if a society in conflict or recovering from conflict is to come to terms with past abuses committed against civilians affected by armed conflict and to prevent future such abuses, drawing attention to the full range of justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be considered, including national, international and “mixed” criminal courts and tribunals and truth and reconciliation commissions, and noting that such mechanisms can promote not only individual responsibility for serious crimes, but also peace, truth, reconciliation and the rights of the victims, Recalling the inclusion of a range of sexual violence offences in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the statutes of the ad hoc international criminal tribunals, Stressing the necessity for all States and non-State parties to conflicts to comply fully with their obligations under applicable international law, including the prohibition on all forms of sexual violence, Recognizing the need for civilian and military leaders, consistent with the principle of command responsibility, to demonstrate commitment and political will to prevent sexual violence and to combat impunity and enforce accountability, and that inaction can send a message that the incidence of sexual violence in conflicts is tolerated, Emphasizing the importance of addressing sexual violence issues from the outset of peace processes and mediation efforts, in order to protect populations at risk and promote full stability, in particular in the areas of pre-ceasefire humanitarian access and human rights agreements, ceasefires and ceasefire monitoring, Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR), Security Sector Reform (SSR) arrangements, justice and reparations, post-conflict recovery and development, Noting with concern the underrepresentation of women in formal peace processes, the lack of mediators and ceasefire monitors with proper training in dealing with sexual violence, and the lack of women as Chief or Lead peace mediators in United Nations-sponsored peace talks, Recognizing that the promotion and empowerment of women and that support for women’s organizations and networks are essential in the consolidation of peace to promote the equal and full participation of women and encouraging Member States, donors, and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to provide support in this respect, Welcoming the inclusion of women in peacekeeping missions in civil, military and police functions, and recognizing that women and children affected by armed S/2009/489 conflict may feel more secure working with and reporting abuse to women in peacekeeping missions, and that the presence of women peacekeepers may encourage local women to participate in the national armed and security forces, thereby helping to build a security sector that is accessible and responsive to all, especially women, Welcoming the efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop gender guidelines for military personnel in peacekeeping operations to facilitate the implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), and operational guidance to assist civilian, military and police components of peacekeeping missions to effectively implement resolution 1820 (2008), Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 16 July 2009 (S/2009/362) and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to make any legal determination as to whether situations that are referred to in the Secretary- General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of

Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 18.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 24. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 25. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance, both as an effective contribution to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs, as well as to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 26.

Urges States to ensure that the applicable requirements of the International Labour Organization for the employment of girls and boys are respected and effectively enforced and that girls who are employed have equal access to decent work, and equal payment and remuneration, are protected from economic exploitation, discrimination, sexual harassment, violence and abuse in the workplace, are aware of their rights and have access to formal and non-formal education, skills development and vocational training, and further urges States to develop gender-sensitive measures, including national action plans, where appropriate, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, including commercial sexual exploitation, slavery-like practices, forced and bonded labour, trafficking and hazardous forms of child labour; 13.
