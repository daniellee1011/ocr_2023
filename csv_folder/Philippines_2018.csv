Invites Member States, their relevant government bodies, the United Nations system, international organizations, donors, the private sector, academia and non-governmental organizations with responsibility for disaster risk reduction and management, in accordance with their mandates, to adopt the Strategic Framework on Geospatial Information and Services for Disasters, recognizing that disaster risk reduction and management requires the commitment and cooperation of all stakeholders. ' See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2015, Supplement No. 26 (E/2015/46), chap. I, sect. B. ? Tbid., 2017, Supplement No. 46 (E/2017/46), chap. I, sect. B. 2/14 Annex Strategic Framework on Geospatial Information and Services for Disasters I. Preamble 1. Member States have the primary responsibility to protect their citizens from the social, economic and environmental impacts of disasters. During the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, Member States reiterated their commitment to address disaster risk reduction and the building of resilience to disasters with a renewed sense of urgency within the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and to integrate, as appropriate, both disaster risk reduction and the building of resilience into policies, plans, programmes and budgets at all levels and to consider both within relevant frameworks. ° 2. Geospatial information has been widely recognized as an important aspect of disaster risk management. The availability and accessibility of quality geospatial data and information from authoritative sources ensure that decision makers and other stakeholders have an accurate common operational picture of critical scenarios before, during and after disasters. 3. During disaster situations, data-sharing mechanisms in support of decision- making are generally not in place. As a result, the many actors and stakeholders simultaneously engaged in response are not only gathering volumes of concurrent and inconsistent geospatial datasets but are also concerned with issues of coordination and communication. This is aggravated further by a situation in which local institutions that see a need to pursue geospatial data development have to compete for government resources and priorities. 4. Recent large-scale disasters caused by natural and human-made hazards have demonstrated the gap between the state of geospatial information and informed decision-making. This situation highlighted the need to find solutions aimed at improving not only the availability and accessibility of quality geospatial information and services, but also coordination and communication among stakeholders at all levels of decision-making across all phases of disaster risk management. It underscores the strong relevance of a strategic framework not only to address the challenges relating to geospatial information management, but also to benchmark best practices implemented worldwide across all phases of disaster risk management. 5. Building on the results of a fact-finding analysis‘ and a review of existing frameworks, rules, legislation and policies,” the Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management prepared a strategic framework that will optimize the benefits of the use of geospatial information and services by Member States and other entities concerned across all phases of disaster risk management. 6. This framework is not only timely in view of the increasing number and impact of disasters but also contributes to the implementation by Member States of the Sendai > Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management, “Draft review of frameworks, rules, legislation, and policies on geospatial information and services for disasters” May 2016. ’ 3/14 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted during the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in March 2015 and subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in June 2015.° It also builds on General Assembly resolution 59/212 of 20 December 2004,’ in which the Assembly called upon Member States, the United Nations and other key stakeholders to assist in addressing knowledge gaps in disaster risk management by improving systems and networks for the collection and analysis of information on disasters, vulnerabilities and disaster risks to facilitate informed decision-making. 7. Furthermore, disaster risk management is central to sustainable development. As such, the framework contributes to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.® II. Expected outcome and goal 8. Building on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the strategic framework aims to achieve the following outcome: The human, socioeconomic and environmental risks and impacts of disasters are prevented or reduced through the use of geospatial information and services. The use of geospatial and relevant statistical information will help Member States to better understand, formulate policies on and manage the risks and impacts of disasters. The realization of this outcome will require the strong commitment and cooperation of all stakeholders and key partners involved in disaster risk management. These include but are not limited to Governments and government agencies, the Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management and United Nations entities, as well as non-governmental organizations, international partners and donors, the private sector, academia and volunteers. 9. The following goal must be pursued by Member States in order to attain the expected outcome: Quality geospatial information and services are available and accessible in a timely and coordinated way to support decision-making and operations within and across all sectors and phases of disaster risk management. Reaching this goal requires Member States to be in the position to develop, maintain and provide the necessary geospatial information and services. 10. The following targets are proposed in order to guide Member States in the assessment of their progress in achieving the outcome and goal of the strategic framework: (a) Awareness is raised among policymakers and concerned entities on the importance of geospatial information and services to the disaster risk management process; regular assessment, monitoring and evaluation of risks and disaster situations are conducted; and a comprehensive plan is developed to implement the five priorities for action identified in this framework; (b) Policies on collaboration, coordination and sharing are established, issued and implemented; ® General Assembly resolution 69/283, annex II. 7 See also General Assembly resolution 69/243. 8 General Assembly resolution 70/1. 4/14 (c) Geospatial databases and information products are developed, maintained and updated based on common standards,” protocols and processes as important tools in every decision-making process across all phases of disaster risk management; (d) Common geospatial information facilities and services are established for all key stakeholders to have a common operational picture of disaster events; (e) Information, education and communications capacities and mechanisms are built and strengthened; (f) Resources are made available to sustain all activities for the enhancement of the use of geospatial information in disaster risk management. Ill. Guiding principles 11. The strategic framework draws from the principles included in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030; General Assembly resolutions 59/212 and 69/243 on international cooperation on humanitarian assistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief to development; the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; the Global Statistical Geospatial Framework of the Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management; and other relevant instruments pertaining, but not limited to, the concepts of open data, communities and sources, as well as the concept of spatial data infrastructure. The implementation of the framework will emphasize the fundamentals of sustainability, accessibility, complementarity and interoperability, while taking into account national circumstances and consistency with domestic laws as well as international obligations and commitments: (a) Each Member State shall be in the position to generate, maintain and provide quality geospatial information and services across all phases of disaster risk management; (b) Geospatial data and information generated and maintained by Member States and the international community shall be openly accessible to the disaster risk management community, as appropriate; (c) The implementation of the framework shall encourage data sharing, interoperability and harmonization among neighbour countries in order to respond efficiently to cross-border disasters; (d) The implementation of the framework shall comply with the standards and requirements of the national spatial data infrastructure or contribute to the establishment of such infrastructure if it is not yet in place; (e) The international organizations and developed countries shall extend and coordinate their support to developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, small island developing States, landlocked developing countries and African countries, as well as middle-income and other countries facing specific disaster risk challenges. ° Open Geospatial Consortium, International Organization for Standardization/Technical Committee 211 on geographic information/geomatics and International Hydrographic Organization, “A guide to the role of standards in geospatial information management, August 2015. Available at http://ggim.un.org/documents/Standards%20Guide%20for%20UNGGIM%20- %20Final.pdf. 5/14 IV. Priorities for action 12. Taking into account the result of the fact-finding analysis and the review of existing frameworks, laws, policies and regulations, and pursuant to the expected outcome and goal, there is a need for a collaborative and coordinated approach within and across sectors in Member States in implementing the following five priorities for action: ¢ Priority 1: governance and policies ¢ Priority 2: awareness-raising and capacity-building ¢ Priority 3: data management ¢ Priority 4: common infrastructure and services ¢ Priority 5: resource mobilization 13. Member States shall take into consideration their respective capacities, resources and priorities, as well as laws and regulations, when implementing the major activities identified for each priority. These activities serve as a guide and can be further enhanced by Member States and other key stakeholders based on their political and socioeconomic situations. Priority 1: governance and policies 14. The management of geospatial information and services for disasters shall be based on good governance and science-based policies. Such policies should collectively form part of other equally important policies on awareness-raising and capacity-building, data management, infrastructure and services, and resource mobilization. Specific activities shall include assessment and planning, institutional arrangements, collaboration and coordination and monitoring and evaluation. National and local levels 15. To achieve this, it is important: (a) For Member States to ensure political and financial support at the highest level for the successful implementation of the five priorities for action; (b) To identify the champion and/or national entity that will oversee the implementation of the five priorities for action and ensure the inclusive participation of all stakeholders and key partners; (c) To establish and maintain open channels of communication with the objective of improving coordination, collaboration and exchange of information and relevant resources; (d) To regularly conduct situational assessment and analysis of the availability, accessibility and usage of quality geospatial information and services. In order to be comprehensive, such assessment shall cover the five priorities for action and be based on established key performance indicators; (ec) On the basis of the results of the assessment, to develop and implement plans and programmes aimed at establishing or strengthening the availability, accessibility and usage of quality geospatial information and services across all phases of disaster risk management; (f) To develop and implement laws and policies to bind all efforts in a systematic and consensus-based road map; 6/14 (g) To establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation scheme supported by a set of metrics to continuously support and further improve both the national and institutional plans and programmes as well as to ensure that geospatial information and services are aligned with changing needs and priorities. Global and regional levels 16. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To encourage collaboration, coordination and partnership between government and non-government actors, between and among geospatial information and emergency response communities, and between Governments and international organizations; (b) To promote mutual learning and exchange of good governance practices and policies among Member States; (c) To provide effective channels where Member States and other stakeholders can share technical knowledge, lessons learned, best practices and case studies; (d) Toregularly conduct assessment of the availability, accessibility and usage of quality geospatial information and services for disaster risk management and related purposes. Priority 2: awareness-raising and capacity-building 17. Risks and impacts of disasters will be properly managed if Member States and other stakeholders are fully aware of their respective geospatial data and information holdings. This requires all entities to bring the necessary changes towards making available and accessible quality geospatial information and services across all phases of disaster risk management. National and local levels 18. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To translate geospatial information and services into components that can easily be understood by a wider audience. Specific strategies may include using local languages, area- and issue-based scenarios, and social media and other platforms in collecting and disseminating information; (b) To promote the inclusion of geospatial information management as applied to disaster risk management in academic programmes; (c) To take on technical responsibilities by leading research endeavours in disaster risk management using up-to-date geospatial information; (d) To examine the capacities of entities to provide training and match them with inventories of existing skills among stakeholders and other key partners and urge Member States to respond to identified gaps and areas for further improvement; (e) To design and implement information, education and communication campaigns and disaster simulation exercises based on the results of training needs assessment initiatives; (f) To design and implement multilevel geospatial information management training programmes as applied to disaster risk management among the data custodians and users within Member States; (g) To strengthen the competencies of Member States and other stakeholders in establishing spatial data infrastructures and open data platforms for geospatial information and services; 7/14 (h) To identify and assess laws, policies and institutional gaps for all awareness-raising and capacity-building initiatives. Global and regional levels 19. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To develop and publish a long-term plan on multisectoral and multilevel capacity-building, including scenario-based modelling and experiments; (b) To conduct data and information management training, especially among humanitarian/responders’ communities; (c) To harness the technical expertise within international partners and donor institutions through the conduct of studies, research and modelling, publish and make available the results of such initiatives to recipient Governments, government agencies and other stakeholders; (d) To benchmark best practices from other Member States and institutions and cascade them to the local context. These practices may come in the form of human resource and system improvements, as well as technology exchange programmes. Benchmarking will also ensure that Governments and government agencies are on par with current global undertakings. Priority 3: data management 20. Acomprehensive method of managing geospatial data and information for their optimal utility by the Member States and other stakeholders is crucial in implementing the strategic framework. That method should include specific activities on data development, including collection; data standards and protocols; and data use guidelines. Modern, cost-effective and open-source technologies may be used to improve data and information management. National and local levels 21. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To develop a common and accessible database system of minimum/ baseline geospatial information and services requirements, including an initial list of essential elements of information addressing all phases of disaster risk management. These include, but are not limited to, comprehensive common operational datasets and fundamental operational datasets, such as administrative boundaries; population; critical infrastructures and other exposure datasets; and earth observation data holdings. Crowdsourced or volunteered geospatial information may be included, but attention should be given to issues of the accuracy, resolution, authoritativeness, integrity, openness and interoperability of such datasets; (b) To develop hazard, vulnerability and disaster risk assessment maps and other information products as crucial inputs to national and local disaster risk management plans and in framing relevant projects, programmes and activities; (c) To maintain a national and local emergency responders common contact database; (d) To develop a registry of all international humanitarian response/assistance organizations to ensure coordination of the deployment of humanitarian aid; (e) To conduct humanitarian profiling and event or incident scenario-building across all phases of disaster risk management; 8/14 (f) To develop business use cases and data/information product templates to respond to mission-critical requests for geospatial information in disaster risk management; (g) To optimize the use of geospatial information products for the development of common operational pictures of disaster events. In turn, this information will be translated by Member States and other stakeholders to reflect existing conditions at the local level; (h) To develop data management policies including, but not limited to, data collection; data sharing; data classification; data custodianship; data stewardship; metadata; data security and control; and data backup and recovery at the local and national levels; (i) To promote the importance of integrating geospatial data and statistics in disaster risk management plans and programmes; (j) To identify and assess laws, policies and institutional gaps for all data management initiatives; (k) To encourage the open data community and government institutions to engage more actively with each other for the complementation and alignment of their respective datasets; (1) To use geospatial information as a major driver for the establishment of the national spatial data infrastructure. Global and regional levels 22. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To encourage Governments and the international community to openly share their data and establish sharing mechanisms that include the identification of mission-specific essential elements of information; (b) To encourage the convergence of existing projects aimed at developing global datasets and collaboration among relevant government agencies in countries, starting with national mapping agencies, to get these datasets completed, updated and validated; (c) To optimize the use of geospatial information products for the development of common operational pictures of disaster events within and across affected regions; (d) To adhere to data management guidelines including, but not limited to, data collection; data sharing; data classification; data custodianship; data stewardship; metadata; data security and control; and data backup and recovery at the global and regional levels; (e) To cascade best practices, particularly established standards, protocols and processes within and among Member States. Priority 4: common infrastructure and services 23. Institutionalizing geospatial information and services requires infrastructure support, such as a common operations centre, facilitated by a dedicated team of experts and support staff. This should be complemented by hardware and software acquisitions, as well as application systems that will serve as data distribution platforms. Interoperability of information will likewise require facilities and systems duly recognized and supported by Member States and other key stakeholders. 9/14 National and local levels 24. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To build on existing systems to develop a common infrastructure and facility, particularly an operations centre supported by a maintenance programme; (b) To implement business use cases, where operations centres will provide common support services in addressing mission-critical requests in all phases of disaster risk management. A mirror system for online and offline processing of data can also be established to sustain operations during disasters; (c) To ensure the interoperability of all systems, processes and skills among and within Member States by adhering to data management guidelines and other geospatial information management standards; (d) To maintain the integrity of established common infrastructure and services by regularly conducting disaster simulation exercises; (ec) To identify and assess laws, policies and institutional gaps for all common infrastructure and services initiatives; (f) To pursue the application of new geospatial information management technologies. Global and regional levels 25. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To assist Member States and other stakeholders in establishing their respective common infrastructure and services; (b) To promote interoperability of systems and processes and share best practices with Member States; (c) To encourage the establishment of regional geoportals for disaster risk management. Priority 5: resource mobilization 26. In order to support the activities identified in this framework, an array of human resources, as well as technical, financial and other forms of logistical and administrative support, is required by Member States and other stakeholders. National and local levels 27. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To sensitize the authorities on the necessity of funding the acquisition, maintenance and updating of geospatial information. In particular, national mapping agencies should be supported to play a key role in the implementation of national spatial data infrastructure that supports the availability and accessibility of quality geospatial information and services across all phases of disaster risk management; (b) To encourage the academic community to prioritize funding for the conduct of related research, development and extension activities, particularly in the implementation of the strategic framework; (c) To encourage the private sectors to invest in the provision of geospatial information and related services for disaster risk management; (d) To identify and assess laws, policies and institutional gaps for all resource mobilization initiatives. 10/14 Global and regional levels 28. To achieve this, it is important: (a) To improve access to funding support for the activities in the implementation of the strategic framework, including provisions for grants, loans and other forms of financial support; (b) To promote resource-sharing mechanisms among Member States and regions with common interests and in similar situations. V. Role of stakeholders 29. Member States should be in the position to generate, maintain and provide quality geospatial information and services. This will require the involvement of national mapping agencies, national disaster management agencies, national statistical institutions, national hydrographic agencies and other relevant government organizations. 30. Itis also recognized that the commitment, goodwill, knowledge, experience and resources of other stakeholders are key to the implementation of the strategic framework. Member States should encourage the following actions on the part of all public and private stakeholders and other key partners: (a) Civil society groups, volunteers’ organizations and other community- based organizations to fully participate in the initiatives of the Government, including technical and administrative provisions relating to geospatial information and services; (b) Private sector institutions, including financial regulators and accounting bodies, as well as philanthropic foundations, to integrate geospatial information and services as a key component to support informed decision-making across all phases of disaster risk management. They should also encourage projects at the national and local levels to adhere to established standards, protocols, guidelines and policies as well as contribute to their strengthening, if necessary; (c) Academic, scientific and research entities and networks to focus their studies on the potential contributions of geospatial information and services across all phases of disaster risk management. The results of this research shall be made available and accessible to the public; (d) Media to take an active and inclusive role at the local, national, regional and global levels in raising public awareness on the importance of geospatial information and services in disaster risk management. 31. The Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management shall play a leading role in setting the agenda for the development of global geospatial information and services, and to promote their use to address key global challenges. As such, it will be well placed to contribute to several of the priorities mentioned in the framework, starting with: (a) Raising the awareness of Member States and other stakeholders on the importance of geospatial information and services before, during and after disasters; (b) Encouraging Member States to develop and promote geospatial databases, standards, protocols and processes aimed at improving data quality and interoperability at the national and global levels; 11/14 (c) Encouraging Member States to develop and implement policies aimed at improving the availability and accessibility of quality geospatial information and services in support of disaster risk management. 32. The United Nations entities concerned shall contribute to the overarching principles reflected in the strategic framework. They should provide a monitoring and evaluation scheme to ensure the relevance of implemented projects, programmes and activities within Governments and government agencies to international agreements. 33. The international funding institutions shall consider prioritizing funding programmes leading to the optimal utilization of geospatial information and services, particularly during disaster events. Similarly, expertise from these organizations can also be harnessed by Member States in implementing the technical and administrative provisions of the framework. VI. Implementation 34. Geospatial information and services contribute vastly to the overarching effort of preventing or reducing the social, economic and environmental impacts of disasters. Thus, Member States and other stakeholders should prioritize a geospatially oriented agenda in their respective development plans and programmes. 35. Member States and other stakeholders should commit themselves to the full implementation of the priorities for action by improving their current capacities in providing geospatial information and services across all phases of disaster risk management and actively promoting the goals of the five priorities for action and translate the same into national implementation plans. 36. A participatory and inclusive approach in generating, improving and managing geospatial information should be employed by all entities involved in disaster risk management efforts. 37. Managing geospatial information and services before, during and after disasters will require all Member States and other stakeholders to institutionalize good governance practices and science-based policies, supported by improved capacities, including in relation to human resources, infrastructure and geospatial data management. 38. In support of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, international cooperation should be recognized as a critical element in managing geospatial information and services before, during and after disasters, and thus implementing the provisions of the strategic framework. Adopting best practices and identifying champions among Member States will augment their existing capacities in using geospatial information and services across all phases of disaster risk management.

disability across its operations and to use the outcome to inform the preparation of an internal policy and action plan to strengthen the ability to mainstream disabilities, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, in particular women, children, youth, persons with

often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they require specific protection and safety measures, and recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, Recognizing also the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level, and in

recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities in development policies and 3/9 programmes, in particular in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other

principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels

I, sect. A. 3/12 Bearing in mind the obligations of States to prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators of trafficking in persons and to protect and empower victims, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims, Seriously concerned that an increasing number of women and girls are being trafficked, including to developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States, and recognizing that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects women and girls and that men and boys are also victims of trafficking, including for sexual exploitation, Highlighting the need to incorporate a gender- and age-sensitive approach into all anti-trafficking efforts, recognizing that women and girls are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced marriage, forced labour and other forms of exploitation, Recognizing the need to address the impact of globalization and the use of technology on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, in particular girls, Recognizing also that pervasive gender inequality, poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination and marginalization and persistent demand for trafficked women and girls are among the underlying causes that make women and girls vulnerable to trafficking, Recognizing further the need to adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand, which fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to trafficking, Recognizing the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations, including in conflict and post-conflict environments, natural disasters and other emergency environments, as well as the devastating consequences for women and girls in such circumstances, and noting in this regard the Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiative and the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change resulting from the Nansen Initiative, while recognizing that not all States are participating in them, Recognizing also the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of being trafficked and to help to identify victims of trafficking in persons, Recognizing further that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls and to protecting and assisting the victims of human trafficking remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt and implement adequate legislation and other measures and to continue improving the collection of reliable data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant factors and of statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls, Recognizing that further work is required both to better understand the link between migration and trafficking in persons and to develop more effective responses to eliminate the risk of trafficking in the migration process in order to, inter alia, further efforts to protect women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse, Concerned about the use of information and communications technologies, including the Internet, for purposes of recruiting for the exploitation of the prostitution of others, including for exploiting women and children and for child 4/12 pornography, including sexual abuse material, paedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse of children, as well as for forced marriage and forced labour, while acknowledging the role that information and communications technologies play in reducing the risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, including by empowering women and children to report such abuses, Concerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of national laws and international standards, Noting with concern that women and girls are also vulnerable to the risk of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal,

persons for the purpose of organ removal”, adopted by the Commission at its twenty-fifth session, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Noting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, exploitative labour and the illegal removal of organs is met by trafficking in persons, and recognizing that human trafficking is fuelled by high profits for traffickers and demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, owing to pervasive and persistent gender inequality, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of the violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness, Taking note of the Doha Declaration on Integrating Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice into the Wider United Nations Agenda to Address Social and Economic Challenges and to Promote the Rule of Law at the National and International Levels, and Public Participation, adopted in April 2015, '© which expresses the importance of implementing a victim-oriented approach to prevent and

also the fact that, according to a report by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation in 2015, an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 844 million people lack a basic water service, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.5 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation and 892 million people still practise open defecation, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow- onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, A/HRC/39/L.11 Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres, and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions, and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes, or practising open defecation, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the respect, promotion and protection of all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Recalling that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to the right to life and human dignity, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds, and with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, income levels or other relevant considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation A/HRC/39/L.11 entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note with appreciation of his report on the theme of the human rights to water and sanitation of forcibly displaced persons;! 3.

Stresses the important role of international cooperation and _ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 5.

anti-trafficking efforts, and recognizing that women and girls are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced marriage, forced labour and other forms of exploitation, Recognizing that pervasive gender inequality, poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination, including multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, marginalization and persistent demand are among the underlying causes that make women and girls vulnerable to human trafficking, Recognizing also the need to adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand, which fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to human trafficking, Recognizing further the role that men and boys can play as agents of change in addressing the harmful impact of gender stereotypes and negative social norms and in preventing violence against women and human trafficking, and underlining the need to educate and engage men and boys for this purpose, Recognizing the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations, including in conflict and post-conflict environments, natural disasters and other emergency environments, as well as the devastating consequences for women and girls in such circumstances, and noting in this regard the Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiative and the Agenda for

Recognizing also that in armed conflict, human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, forced marriage and labour exploitation can be prevalent, and expressing deep concern over its negative impacts on victims of human trafficking, Recognizing further the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of women and girls of being subjected to human trafficking and to help to identify victims of human trafficking, Recognizing that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls and to protecting and assisting the victims of human trafficking remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt and implement adequate legislation and other measures and to continue improving the collection of reliable data disaggregated by sex, age, nationality, disability, geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts and other relevant factors and of statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls, Recognizing also that further work is

persons for the purpose of organ removal”, adopted by the Commission at its twenty-fifth session, * Recognizing that victims of human trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel human trafficking, Noting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and the illegal removal of organs is met by human trafficking, and recognizing that human trafficking is fuelled by high profits for traffickers and demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, Acknowledging that women and girl victims of human trafficking, owing to pervasive and persistent gender inequality, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with human trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of the violations and abuses of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness, Taking note of the Doha Declaration on Integrating Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice into the Wider United Nations Agenda to Address Social and Economic

with Disabilities, Taking note of the preparation of the United Nations 2018 flagship report on disability and development: realization of Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities, and of the note by the Secretariat which provides an overview of the flagship report, !® Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Acknowledging the Secretary-General’s decision to conduct an institutional review of the current United Nations approach to mainstreaming disability across its operations, which would inform the preparation of an internal policy and action plan to strengthen the ability of the United Nations system to mainstream disabilities, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters, Recognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, and that persons with disabilities and their families should receive social protection and assistance to enable the family and its members to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with disabilities, Recognizing further the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality, non-discrimination and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full 3/10 application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Concerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, a lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, Recognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities in development policies and programmes, and, in particular, in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, meaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive society and development, 4/10 Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,'’ and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high - quality, accessible, timely and reliable data to measure progress in the implementation of the Goals for persons with disabilities, 1.
