Recognizes that middle-income countries still face significant challenges in achieving sustainable development and that, in order to ensure that achievements made to date are sustained, efforts to address ongoing challenges should be strengthened through the exchange of experiences, improved coordination and better and focused support of the United Nations development system, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders, and therefore requests those stakeholders to ensure that the diverse and specific development needs of middle-income countries are appropriately considered and addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a view to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual countries, while also acknowledging that official development assistance and other concessional finance is still important for a number of these countries and has a role to play for targeted results, taking into account the specific needs of these countries; 35. Also recognizes that, while social development is primarily the responsibility of Governments, international cooperation and assistance are essential for the full achievement of that goal, and calls upon the international community to continue to support the resolution of challenges faced by developing countries, especially the least developed countries, including in Africa, to independently achieving sustainable development; 10/14 36.

Urges African Governments, within the framework of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, to expand investment financing to agriculture to at least 10 per cent of the annual budget of the national public sector while at the same time ensuring necessary action in policy and institutional reforms for enhanced performance of the agriculture industry and systems; 42. Recognizes the need for Africa’s development partners that are supporting agriculture, food security and nutrition in Africa to align their efforts more specifically towards supporting the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, using the Programme’s investment plans for the alignment of external funding; 43.

Urges African countries to pay close attention to inclusive, equitable and sustainable growth capable of being employment-intensive, including through employment-intensive investment programmes, aimed at reducing inequalities, increasing productive employment, generating decent work for all, particularly those who are vulnerable, including women and young people, and improving real per capita incomes in both rural and urban areas; 46. Emphasizes the need, in particular for African countries, to enhance capacity-building for sustainable development, and in this regard calls for the strengthening of technical and scientific cooperation, including North-South, South- South and triangular cooperation, and reiterates the importance of adequate human resources development, including through training, the exchange of experience and expertise, knowledge transfer and technical assistance for capacity-building, which involves strengthening institutional capacity, including policy coherence, coordination and implementation, as well as planning, management and monitoring capacities; 47. Also emphasizes the importance of increasing international cooperation to improve the quality of and access to education, including efforts to realize girls’ right to education, in particular for African countries, including through building and strengthening education-related infrastructure and increasing investment in education, and takes note of continental initiatives such as the African Union International Centre for Girls’ and Women’s Education in Africa, which implemented activities in line with its strategic plan for the period 2018-2020 and officially launched the Africa Educates Her campaign on 11 September 2020, a rallying call to get girls back to school; 48. Urges African countries and development partners to meet the needs of young people and empower them, in particular by tackling the high levels of youth unemployment through the development of quality education, skills training and entrepreneurship programmes that address illiteracy, enhance the employability and capabilities of young people, facilitate school-to-work transitions and expand guaranteed employment schemes, where appropriate, with particular attention to disadvantaged young people in both rural and urban areas, and in this regard takes note of the launch at the Pan African Youth Forum on the theme “Africa unite for youth: bridging the gap and reaching African youth”, held in Addis Ababa from 24 to 27 April 2019, of the African Union 1 million by 2021 initiative, which targets direct investments in millions of African youth on four key elements, namely employment, entrepreneurship, education and engagement, through leveraging partnerships and private sector opportunities; 49. Reaffirms the commitment of the General Assembly to bridging digital and knowledge divides, recognizes that its approach must be multidimensional and include an evolving understanding of what constitutes access, emphasizing the quality of that access, and acknowledges that speed, stability, affordability, language, local content and accessibility for persons with disabilities are now core elements of the quality of such access and that high-speed broadband is already an essential enabler of sustainable development; 50. Recognizes that improving access to school for all girls and boys, especially the poorest and most vulnerable and marginalized, and their ability to receive a quality education, and improving the quality of education beyond primary school can have a positive impact in terms of empowerment and on social, economic 12/14 and political participation and thus on the fight against poverty and hunger and can contribute directly to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals; 51. Also recognizes that Africa’s youthful population creates significant opportunities for the continent’s development, and underlines in this regard the importance of African countries creating appropriate policy environments, in collaboration with the United Nations system, in order to realize a demographic dividend, while adopting an inclusive results-based approach to development planning and implementation in accordance with national priorities and legislation; 52. Encourages Governments, international organizations, other relevant institutions and stakeholders, as appropriate, to provide relevant skills training for youth, high-quality health-care services and dynamic labour markets to employ a growing population; 53.

The International Solar Alliance, an initiative of India and France, was founded in 2015 at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris. In the Paris declaration regarding the launch of the Alliance, the shared vision of bringing clean, affordable and renewable energy within the reach of all was expounded. It set for the members the mission to mobilize more than $1 trillion in investments for the mass deployment of affordable solar energy by 2030. The then Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, attended the ceremony in Paris, on 30 November 2015, at which the Alliance was launched. Establishment of the International Solar Alliance 2. The international steering committee of the International Solar Alliance, established at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, deliberated on and finalized the framework agreement on the establishment of the Alliance and the institutional framework of the Alliance and its secretariat. The agreement was opened for signature at the twenty-second Conference of the Parties, in 2016, and entered into force on 6 December 2017 in accordance with article XIII of the agreement, with the Alliance acquiring the status of a treaty-based international organization. Subsequently, the framework agreement was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. The founding conference of the International Solar Alliance, held on 11 March 2018, saw the adoption of the “Delhi Solar Agenda”, in which the parties to the framework agreement reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 4. The framework agreement provides that the seat of the International Solar Alliance shall be in India. The Alliance signed a headquarters agreement with the Government of India on 26 March 2018 in which the international legal personality of the Alliance was recognized, consistent with article X of the framework agreement. Article X also provides that, in the territory of each member State and subject to its national laws and the conclusion of a separate agreement, if necessary, the Alliance may enjoy the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent discharge of its functions and programmes. Subsequently, after transferring all assets and liabilities to the first Assembly of the Alliance in October 2018, the international steering committee of the Alliance ceased to exist pursuant to article XIII of the framework agreement. Institutional and organizational structure Assembly 5. The Assembly of the International Solar Alliance, which was established under article IV of the framework agreement and includes representatives from each member State, is the chief decision-making body of the Alliance. The Assembly takes all necessary decisions on the implementation of the agreement and on coordinated action to be taken to achieve its objectives. It is chaired by the President and co-chaired by the Co-President, both elected by the Assembly for a term of two years. The President and the Co-President are supported by eight Vice-Presidents, two each from the four geographical regions of the Alliance — Africa, Asia and the Pacific, 5/20 A/76/192 Europe and others, and Latin America and the Caribbean — selected on the basis of seniority in terms of the submission of the instrument of ratifications to the depositary of the Alliance, that is, the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India. 6. The first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held on 3 October 2018. The Assembly adopted a number of significant decisions, including on the programme of work and budget, the approval of the provisional rules of procedure of the Assembly, the appointment of the Director General, a model agreement on privileges and immunities between the Alliance and individual member States, and the approval of the manual of regulations for the Alliance. Subsequent meetings of the Assembly were held in 2019 and 2020, with a special assembly convened in February 2021 to appoint the successor to the then Director General of the Alliance. Currently, India and France are the Co-Presidents of the Assembly. Standing committee 7. The standing committee, established by the Assembly, comprises the President, the Co-President, eight Vice-Presidents, and up to nine additional members who may be appointed in accordance with rule 79 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The standing committee is responsible and accountable to the Assembly and carries out the powers and functions entrusted to it under the rules of procedure, as well as those functions delegated to it by the Assembly. The committee is mandated, inter alia, to consider the programme of work and budget of the International Solar Alliance, to substantiate the approved programme of work, to take stock of Alliance programmes, to consider and recommend to the Assembly proposals with substantial financial implications for the Alliance, and to advise the secretariat on any emergent issues, upon request. Regional committees 8. To enhance regional cooperation and collaboration, a regional committee is established by the Assembly, under its rules of procedure, for each of the four regions of the International Solar Alliance. Each regional committee comprises the two Vice- Presidents selected from the region and all other Alliance members from the region. The regional committees are responsible and accountable to the Assembly. The regional committees serve as the forum for the regional coordination of views on matters related to the Assembly. The regional committees are mandated, inter alia, to support the harmonization and aggregation of demand, to review the scope of solar applications for members and to assess the aggregate effect of the Alliance programmes in the region. Secretariat 9. The secretariat is established pursuant to article V of the framework agreement. The members, Assembly and committees of the International Solar Alliance are supported by the secretariat to assist them in their collective work under the agreement and the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The secretariat comprises the Director General, who is the Chief Executive Officer, and other staff, as required. The standing committee of the Alliance has approved the provision of 12 international posts and 20 national posts at the Alliance secretariat, for which recruitment is in process. 10. The secretariat coordinates all programmes, activities and initiatives entrusted to it by the Assembly through the national focal points, appointed by each member State in accordance with article II of the framework agreement. 11. Article VIII of the framework agreement provides that partner organization status may be granted to organizations that have the potential to help the International 6/20 A/76/192 Solar Alliance to achieve its objectives. It is specifically stated therein that the United Nations, including its organs, will be the strategic partner of the Alliance. At its first meeting on 3 October 2018, the Assembly requested the secretariat to establish institutional links between the Alliance and the United Nations and authorized the secretariat to apply for observer status for the Alliance in the General Assembly of the United Nations. Membership 12. The International Solar Alliance was established as an alliance of solar-resource rich countries, with its membership open to the 121 States Members of the United Nations that lie fully or partially between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. However, on 3 October 2018, the first Assembly of the Alliance adopted a resolution proposed by India to amend the framework agreement of the Alliance to expand the scope of its membership to all Member States. The amendment entered into force on 8 January 2021 and was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. As of July 2021, 79 States members of the Alliance and 19 other States are expected to ratify the agreement. 13. The current membership of the International Solar Alliance covers a significant proportion of the global population. Moreover, a large proportion of the membership is comprised of the least developed countries and small island developing States that stand to benefit significantly from the programmes and activities of the Alliance. As of July 2021, the following States from the four regions of the Alliance are members: Africa 1. Algeria 2. Benin 18. Guinea 19. Madagascar 20. Malawi 3. Botswana 21. Mali 4. Burkina Faso 22.

Under the Paris declaration of the International Solar Alliance, the Alliance is mandated to promote collaboration and cooperation among its member States in order to lower the cost of solar energy and facilitate the massive and needs-based deployment of solar energy through innovative policies, projects, programmes, capacity-building measures and financial instruments. As an action-oriented organization, the Alliance was established to support and enhance the efforts of the global community aimed at meeting the collective ambition of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on Goals 7 and 13. 15. The International Solar Alliance lends its support to its member States across the three critical areas of energy access, energy security and energy transition. The strategic interventions of the Alliance are aimed at reducing the cost of technology and finance and at facilitating the mobilization of low-cost investment in the solar energy sector. 16. The International Solar Alliance plays the crucial roles of accelerator, enabler, incubator and facilitator of the deployment of clean and affordable solar energy at scale to address those key critical issues. As an accelerator, the Alliance supports the creation of economies of scale in the solar energy sector across its membership and the reduction of transaction costs to lower the cost of deploying solar energy in member States. As an enabler, it supports capacity-building interventions to create a well-qualified pool of human resources talent to drive solar energy programmes in member States. 17. In addition, the International Solar Alliance supports the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory ecosystem across its membership through knowledge creation and exchange. As an incubator, the Alliance supports, through its network of partnerships, the development and adoption of innovative financing and risk mitigation modalities across its membership to attract low-cost private and institutional finance. As a facilitator, it supports member States with developing viable solar energy road maps and integrating these with their overarching energy and climate objectives. Further, the Alliance facilitates the mobilization of finance for solar energy projects. 18. To achieve the vision and mission of the International Solar Alliance, the following guiding principles for members of the Alliance are set down in article II of its framework agreement: (a) Members take coordinated actions through programmes and activities launched on a voluntary basis, aimed at better harmonizing and aggregating demand 9/20 A/76/192 for, inter alia, solar finance, solar technologies, innovation, research and development, and capacity-building; (b) In this endeavour, members cooperate closely and strive to establish mutually beneficial relationships with relevant organizations, public and private stakeholders, and non-member States; (c) For those solar applications for which it seeks the benefits of collective action under the Alliance and on the basis of a common analytical mapping of solar applications, each member shares and updates relevant information regarding its needs and objectives, domestic measures and initiatives taken or intended to be taken in order to achieve these objectives, and obstacles along the value chain and dissemination process. The secretariat maintains a database of these assessments in order to highlight the potential for cooperation. VI. Funding 19. The International Solar Alliance was conceived as a voluntary alliance of sovereign countries with no membership fee. Article VI of its framework agreement outlines the sources of funding, which include voluntary contributions from member States, partner organizations including regional economic integration organizations and the United Nations and its agencies, and the private sector as potential sources of funding for the Alliance. The revenue generated from specific activities, approved by the Assembly, are additional sources of finance for the Alliance. 20. India, the host country of the International Solar Alliance, made an initial contribution of $16 million to the Alliance corpus fund, in addition to its contribution to the recurring expenditure of the Alliance for five years from 2016 to 2021. 21. Myanmar and the Comoros have made voluntary contributions to the corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance. France, the co-founder of the Alliance, has provided initial support through the provision of two experts to the Alliance secretariat, as well as initial support of €50,000 for the programme to enable solar technical centres in member States. In addition, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Australia have made financial and/or in- kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 22. The partner organizations of the International Solar Alliance, such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Union, the French Development Agency, the Climate Investment Funds and the World Resources Institute, have also made financial and in-kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 23. Asof March 2021, the total corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance stood at $33.5 million, with contributions amounting to $17.5 million from the corporate sector. VII. Programme and projects 24. The International Solar Alliance has launched seven thematic programmes since its inception that are dedicated to the deployment of cross-cutting solar energy applications across multiple sectors, including agriculture, health and electricity. The programmes of the Alliance are intended to provide a holistic solution to the triple challenge of energy access, energy security and energy transition through a blend of small-scale off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications and large 10/20 A/76/192 utility-scale projects. The following are the seven thematic programmes of the Alliance: (a) Scaling solar applications for agricultural use. This programme is focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications, including solar water pumping systems, solar energy-based drinking water applications and water, sanitation and hygiene interventions; solar home lighting and other off-grid lighting solutions; and solar energy-based cold storage; (b) Affordable finance at scale. This is an overarching programme dedicated to identifying and promoting innovative financing modalities and risk mitigation instruments to lower the cost of finance in the solar energy sector; (c) Scaling solar mini-grids. This programme is dedicated to promoting the electrification of regions that have yet to establish grid connectivity; (d) Scaling solar rooftop. This programme is dedicated to the promotion of solar rooftop applications for industrial, commercial and government consumers; (e) Scaling solar e-mobility and storage. This programme is dedicated to promoting e-mobility solutions based on solar energy, solar-powered charging infrastructure and energy storage solutions at scale; (f) Solar park. This programme complements other programmes that are focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications to meet the challenge of energy access. It focuses on deploying large utility-scale ground- mounted solar projects to support member States in integrating solar energy into their energy mix at the speed and scale necessary to meet the challenges of energy security and energy transition; (g) Solar heating and cooling. This programme is dedicated to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the rapidly increasing heating and cooling requirements across the membership of the Alliance. The programme encompasses the industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential sectors. 25. In addition to the thematic programmes, the International Solar Alliance has launched specific sectoral interventions, such as the “ISA CARES” initiative, which is aimed at solarizing the health sector to address the challenge of energy access, with a particular focus on developing and least developed countries. The aim of the initiative is to provide not only solar energy-based electricity but additional infrastructure such as solar-powered vaccine cold chains and mobile health clinics. VIII. Capacity-building programmes 26. The International Solar Alliance has been equally receptive to the capacity- building needs of its member States to develop and manage solar assets, including those to be deployed under its thematic programmes and other initiatives. The Alliance is working to support its members in developing capacity to deploy scaled- up solar applications through the development of a network of technical training, entrepreneurship, research and innovation centres in order to harmonize and deliver training programmes using a network of training facilities that would be recognized across the member States. 27. The Solar Technology Applications and Resources Centre network will facilitate the exchange of best practices and promote knowledge dissemination and capacity - building with regard to solar energy, supporting stakeholders across the full deployment process (including technicians, master trainers, project developers, engineers and policymakers). In addition, the network is aimed at supporting the 11/20 A/76/192 standardization of solar technology applications and supporting collaborative research and development, including with the private sector. IX. Projects in individual countries 28. The International Solar Alliance has launched an initiative, approved at its third Assembly, to facilitate, through technical and financial support, solar energy demonstration projects across 47 least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States of the Alliance — 26 countries from the African region, 12 from the Asia and the Pacific region and 9 from the Latin American and the Caribbean region. 29. The initiative is aimed at deploying projects for developing resilience in the agriculture and health sectors. The selection of projects would be member-driven. As of February 2021, project proposals have been received from 16 member States among the least developed countries and small island developing States, while discussions with the remaining least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States are under way. 30. The goal of the International Solar Alliance is to facilitate affordable access for member States to funding for solar projects. To this end, through a partnership between the Alliance, the World Bank and the French Development Agency, the solar risk mitigation initiative was launched at the twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Although the cost of solar energy is constantly falling, its deployment remains slow in certain emerging markets, notably in Africa, where a belief is held in the private sector that the funding of solar projects entails too many risks. The solar risk mitigation initiative is aimed at reversing this trend. It involves the creation of the following: (a) A technical assistance programme for developing sustainable solar projects (support for planning, resource mapping and electrical sector reform) and the solar deployment guidelines, which help countries to identify clear and stable solar goals; (b) A new procurement platform, which will be launched online and will be used to facilitate and collect solar project bids; (c) Hedging instruments to protect against the financial risks inherent in renewable energy production projects, in order to guarantee the solvency of the suppliers. 31. The International Solar Alliance, in partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, is also facilitating a pilot project for solar-powered food and vaccine cold chain technologies in Nigeria. The project is aimed at demonstrating innovative and low-cost technologies that are run on self-sustaining financial models. 32. The International Solar Alliance has signed an agreement with the African Development Bank to harness solar energy. The basic objective of the joint declaration, as mentioned in the agreement, was to develop a road map to mobilize financing for the promotion of solar energy in prospective African International Solar Alliance member States. 12/20 A/76/192 X. Observer status for the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly 33. The primary objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Accelerating the transition towards a low-carbon economy and boosting investments in infrastructure for renewable energy, notably solar power, is therefore critical to realizing the goals of the Agreement. 34. Accordingly, solar energy is an important constituent of renewable energy as an alternative source owing to its wider availability as well as its affordability. The International Solar Alliance is being established at a time when there is a growing need for renewable energy as an alternative source of energy at both the global and regional levels. 35. The International Solar Alliance is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations sustainable development process and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. The primary goal of the Alliance is to lower the cost of finance and spur investments across the solar supply chain, including in manufacturing, project development and storage. 36. The aims, objectives and activities of the International Solar Alliance as set out in the framework agreement and its activities as reflected in the programmes are relevant to the work of the General Assembly in the area of renewable energy. The Alliance is striving to promote the massive deployment of solar energy globally and thereby provide energy security and promote sustainable development in its member States. 37. The promotion of solar energy in the context of the health infrastructure in developing countries supports the achievement of Goal 3, aimed at ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. 38. The various activities of the International Solar Alliance advance many of the objectives of the Paris Agreement and thus contribute to addressing the challenges posed by global warming. 39. The International Solar Alliance plays an important role internationally in supporting the implementation of several United Nations conventions on climate change and the global climate change agenda in general. The participation of the Alliance in major international meetings involving these issues is often critical for the Alliance to carry out its work and mandate. In addition, the Alliance has the wide- ranging resources and expertise needed to make a significant contribution to all such meetings, dialogues and decisions by helping to shape the global policy dialogue and supporting its implementation on solar energy. 40. Since the entry into force of the amendment to the framework agreement on 8 January 2021, the membership of the International Solar Alliance has been universalized and is open to all States Members of the United Nations. It is expected to expand quickly, giving a boost to the efforts of the Alliance to promote the use of solar energy globally. 41. The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance explicitly designates the United Nations, including its organs, as a strategic partner of the Alliance. Observer status will greatly enhance the ability of the Alliance to achieve its goals. The Alliance will be able to follow the deliberations in the General Assembly closely, to cooperate with United Nations organs, agencies and programmes in the implementation of its programmes and activities and to benefit 13/20 A/76/192 from the United Nations through its network of field offices, experience in programme cooperation with Governments, and extensive resources in the development process. 42. We believe that the International Solar Alliance can contribute positively to the fields of sustainable development, renewable energy and climate change and can enhance the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. 43. Granting observer status to the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly would enable the Alliance to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes on the basis of grass-root level experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. The Alliance is also taking a big step towards addressing issues such as technology transfer, the storage of solar energy, and even financial assistance to member States, along with project layout and project planning measures. 44. Cooperation between the United Nations and the International Solar Alliance has the potential to support progress towards building national capacities to reduce poverty and exclusion, enhancing sustainable human development and achieving nationally and internationally agreed development goals. The initiatives of the United Nations and the Alliance can serve as a powerful tool for addressing the challenges faced by developing countries and accelerating progress towards the Goals, and specifically Goal 7: to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. 45. The International Solar Alliance, through its efforts to bring about just and equitable energy solutions through the deployment of solar energy, is expected to usher in a new era of green energy diplomacy. The granting of observer status to the Alliance in the General Assembly would help to provide for regular and well-defined cooperation between the Alliance and the United Nations that would benefit global clean energy growth and sustainable development. 14/20 A/76/192 Annex I1 Framework Agreement on the establishment of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) We, the Parties to this Agreement, Recalling the Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance of 30"" November 2015 and the shared ambition to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than US $ 1000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy, and pave the way for future technologies adapted to the needs, Recognizing that solar energy provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to their peoples, Acknowledging the specific and common obstacles that still stand in the way of rapid and massive scale-up of solar energy in these countries, Affirming that these obstacles can be addressed if solar resource rich countries act in a coordinated manner, with strong political impulse and resolve, and that better harmonizing and aggregating the demand for inter alia solar finance, technologies, innovation or capacity building, across countries, will provide a strong lever to lower costs, increase quality, and bring reliable and affordable solar energy within the reach of all, United in their desire to establish an effective mechanism of coordination and decision-making among them, Have agreed as follows: Article I Objective Parties hereby establish an International Solar Alliance (hereinafter referred to as the ISA), through which they will collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in line with their needs.

prioritisation as the mission focussing on those specific mandated tasks which are based on up-to-date conflict analysis and planning and are assessed as responding to the evolving needs on the ground, and further understanding sequencing as a logical, flexible implementation of the mandate over time, in line with the strategic vision as set out 2/6 S/2021/771 in the mandate, aligned with the peace and security needs within the host State, building towards a consolidation of peace, Recognising that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is the responsibility of all stakeholders and is contingent upon several critical factors, including well-defined, realistic and achievable mandates, political will, leadership, performance and accountability at all levels,

population are taken into account, which encompasses activities, including promotion of justice and accountability, aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, addressing root causes, assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction and development, and emphasising that sustaining peace is a shared task and responsibility that needs to be fulfilled by the government and all other national stakeholders and should flow through all three pillars of the United Nations’ engagement at all stages of conflict, and in all its dimensions, and needs sustained international attention and assistance, 1. Stresses the crucial role peace operations play in the pursuit of sustainable political solutions and building peace, and, in this regard, emphasises the need for peace operations to engage at the earliest possible stage in integrated planning and coordination on transitions with the Resident Coordinators, United Nations Country Team, other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, the host State and other national stakeholders including civil society and further emphasises that in order to be sustainable, the transition planning process should take into account broad challenges, including risks to stability, governance, and the rule of law, as well as the political, economic, development, humanitarian, and human rights context; 2.

outcomes of the international conferences on development cooperation with middle- income countries, Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global

complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, Reaffirming further the Paris Agreement' and its early entry into force, encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement, and parties to the United Please rccyclc@ - ﬁ- 21-14506 iEi 141021 DN O A Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change? that have not

building resilience to economic and environmental shocks remain a challenge in many middle-income countries, Welcoming the New Urban Agenda, adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito, Ecuador, from 17 to 20 October 2016,* Recalling its resolutions 70/215 of 22 December 2015, 72/230 of 20 December 2017 and 74/231 of 19 December 2019, Recalling also that the 2030 Agenda recognizes, inter alia, that middle-income countries still face significant challenges to achieve sustainable development and that, in order to ensure that achievements made to date are sustained, efforts to address ongoing challenges should be strengthened through the exchange of experiences, improved coordination and better and focused support of the United Nations development system, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders, Reaffirming its resolutions 71/243 of 21 December 2016 and 75/233 of 21 December 2020 on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system, in which it recognized that middle-income countries

middle-income countries in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, held on 17 June and 2 July 2021 at United Nations Headquarters, Taking note of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization Strategic Framework for Partnering with Middle-Income Countries, adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization at its eighteenth session, held in Abu Dhabi from 3 to 7 November 2019, in its resolution GC.18/Res.9 of 7 November 2019, Emphasizing that cohesive, nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of efforts by Member States, reiterating that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and 2 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 3 Resolution 69/283, annex II. 2/8 development strategies cannot be overemphasized, highlighting the need to respect each country’s policy space and leadership in the implementation of policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development while remaining consistent with relevant international rules and commitments, recognizing that national development efforts need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually supporting world trade, monetary and financial systems and strengthened and enhanced global economic governance, and highlighting the fact that processes to develop and facilitate the availability of appropriate knowledge and technologies globally, on mutually agreed terms, as well as capacity - building, are also critical, including pursuing policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors and reinvigorating the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development and for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, Recognizing that, as per capita income increases above low-income thresholds, access to external public finance often decreases faster than can be offset by commensurate increases in tax revenues in per capita terms, Recognizing also that the enhanced and revitalized Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, led by Governments, will be a vehicle for strengthening international cooperation and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while noting that multi-stakeholder partnerships and the resources, knowledge and ingenuity of the private sector, civil society, the scientific community, academia, philanthropy and foundations, parliaments, local authorities, volunteers and other stakeholders will be important in mobilizing and sharing knowledge, expertise, technology and financial resources, complementing the efforts of Governments and supporting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular in developing countries, Recalling that the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States deserve special attention, as do countries in situations of conflict and post-conflict countries, and that there are also serious challenges within many middle-income countries, Recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to development and that development cooperation by the United Nations development system should respond to the varying development needs of programme countries, including those of middle- income countries, in a manner that addresses their specific challenges while mindful of their diversity, and recognizing also that revitalized, strategic, flexible and results- and action-oriented United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks should be prepared and finalized in full consultation and agreement with national Governments and aligned with national development plans, strategies and circumstances in support of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Noting that, over the past 15 years, 29 low-income countries have transitioned to middle-income country status, reflecting the sustained economic growth achieved in most parts of the developing world, Noting also that national averages based on criteria such as per capita income do not always reflect the actual particularities and development needs of middle- income countries and that, despite notable progress in reducing poverty levels in both absolute and relative terms, poverty remains a problem in many middle-income countries, as they are still home to 62 per cent of the world’s people living in poverty, Noting further the willingness to develop a wider analysis of new measures, building on existing experiences with eligibility exception, for concessional finance 3/8 and multidimensional assessments to address the limitations of an income-only assessment of development and graduation readiness, Recognizing with concern that the prevalence of undernourishment has been increasing in many countries, exacerbated by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, with most of those (49 out of 69) being middle-income countries and countries that rely heavily on international trade in primary commodities, Recognizing that inequality, or even a rise in inequality, remains pervasive in middle-income countries, even in those with high levels of economic growth, that further investments in social services and economic opportunities are needed in order to reduce inequalities and that economic growth needs to be sustained, inclusive and equitable, Stressing that middle-income countries continue to face challenges related to, inter alia, job creation, natural resource management, reliance on primary commodity exports, the adverse effects of disaster risks and climate change, high levels of external debt and the volatility of exchange rates and capital flows and, in this regard, that efforts to create a national enabling environment for development should be complemented by a global enabling environment, Stressing also the importance that middle-income countries need access to and development of better technologies, research and innovation and better management practices, which can foster skills development, boost productivity and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, Recognizing that connectivity through quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all, contributes to the sustainable development of middle-income countries, Recalling that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and effective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national ownership, are central to our common pursuit of sustainable development, including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, Recalling also the resolve of Member States to enhance and strengthen domestic resource mobilization and fiscal space, including, where appropriate, through modernized tax systems, more efficient tax collection, the broadening of the tax base and the effective combating of tax evasion and capital flight, and reiterating that, while each country is responsible for its tax system, it is important to support national efforts in these areas by strengthening technical assistance and enhancing international cooperation and participation in addressing international tax matters, Recalling further the importance of international support, in various forms, including North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, that is well aligned with national priorities to contribute to addressing the development needs of middle- income countries, including through capacity-building, Recognizing the need to better understand the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, and acknowledging the significant role that the United Nations system has played and should continue to play in this regard, Expressing concern that climate change is adversely affecting productivity in every country, in particular developing countries, including middle-income countries, as extreme weather shocks directly affect productivity through the destruction of infrastructure and labour force displacement, and that a number of middle-income countries have sizeable sectors that are exposed to climate change, such as agriculture, construction, mining, tourism and transport, 4/8 Reaffirming that achieving gender equality, empowering all women and girls, and the full realization of their human rights are essential to achieving sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, and in that regard reiterating the need for gender mainstreaming, including targeted actions and investments in the formulation and implementation of all financial, economic, environmental and social policies, Noting with concern that the debt service of middle-income countries has increased since 2011, reaching almost 18 per cent of total exports, Recognizing with concern that total external debt stocks in middle-income countries, excluding small island developing States, grew by 8 per cent per annum over the period from 2009 to 2018, total external debt has grown by over 20 per cent since 2016 and the current debt represents 26.8 per cent of their combined gross domestic product, and that the debt of middle-income countries is not only growing at a faster pace than anticipated, but is a more costly debt with a shorter maturity, Reiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the recognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, and recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first, [Placeholder cross-cutting paragraph on COVID-19] Noting with concern that the COVID-19 pandemic, apart from creating an unprecedented global public health crisis and affecting the most vulnerable populations, has had a devastating effect on the economies of middle-income countries, through the introduction of lockdowns and suspensions of economic activity leading to rising extreme poverty and food insecurity, unprecedented job losses, disruptions in regional and global production chains and stagnating international trade, collapsing commodities prices, shrinking remittances and numerous other channels, a decline in global foreign direct investment, the sharp contraction in the already limited fiscal space and the bleak economic outlook that has suppressed investment, undermining future growth prospects and long-term productivity trends, 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General; 2.

Welcomes the solidarity of middle-income countries with other developing countries, in particular the financial, technical, technology transfer on mutually agreed terms and capacity-building support being provided by middle-income countries, particularly to the least developed countries, through South-South and triangular cooperation, while stressing that South-South cooperation is a complement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, and in this regard calls upon the United Nations development system to continue its ongoing efforts to mainstream support to South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation; 9. Also welcomes the outcome document of the second High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation held in Buenos Aires from 20 to 22 March 2019,° and notes the report of the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation at its twentieth session, held from 1 to 4 June 2021;’ 10.

population living in extreme poverty forecast to have increased from 8.4 per cent in 2019 to 9.5 per cent in 2020, representing an additional 97 million pushed into extreme poverty, acknowledging that the world gross domestic product contracted by 3.6 per cent in 2020 and that the expected rebound of 5.4 per cent in 2021 will be unevenly distributed among countries, with an especially slow recovery projected in developing countries and with the drop in per capita incomes having a particularly adverse impact on low-income households, jeopardizing decades of progress in reducing extreme poverty and exacerbating already high levels of inequality, recognizing that, despite massive policy support, the estimated 8.5 trillion United States dollars in cumulative output losses during 2020 and 2021 may erase nearly all output gains of the previous four years,® and that COVID-19 has laid bare the immense challenges facing the world, ranging from inadequate health infrastructure to the lack of universal basic social protection, making the implementation of the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2018—-2027) especially challenging, Underlining that the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2018-2027), on the theme “Accelerating global actions for a world without poverty”, will be important for maintaining the momentum generated by the implementation of 3/12 the Second Decade towards poverty eradication and ensuring that markets work better for people living in poverty, Reaffirming that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, that its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development, that increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification and other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and low-lying coastal countries, including many least developed countries and small island developing States, and that the survival of many societies and of the biological support systems of the planet is at risk, which further threatens food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and thus requires urgent action to maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains achieved in the past decades, Urging all countries that have not yet done so to ratify and accede to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, ° encouraging parties to review its implementation, committing to making the Convention an effective instrument to deter, detect, prevent and counter corruption and bribery, prosecute those involved in corrupt activities and recover and return stolen assets to their country of origin, as appropriate, encouraging the international community to develop good practices on asset return, expressing support for the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative of the United Nations and the World Bank and other international initiatives that support the recovery of stolen assets, urging that regional conventions against corruption be updated and ratified, and striving to eliminate safe havens that create incentives for the transfer abroad of stolen assets and illicit financial flows, Committed to working to strengthen regulatory frameworks at all levels to further increase the transparency and accountability of financial institutions and the corporate sector, as well as public administrations, and to strengthening international cooperation and national institutions to combat money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, Reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda, of which the Addis Ababa Action Agenda is an integral part, as well as an ethical, social, political, environmental and economic imperative for all humankind and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in least developed countries, in landlocked developing countries, in small island developing States and in some middle-income countries, as well as countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, and underlining the importance of addressing the multidimensional nature of development and poverty and accelerating sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, including full, productive employment and decent work for all, with a view to reducing inequalities within and among countries, Recognizing the importance of supporting countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, and to promote the empowerment of the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including women, children and youth, indigenous peoples and local communities, older persons, persons with disabilities, migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons, Reaffirming the political declaration of the high-level meeting on universal health coverage, held in New York on 23 September 2019, entitled “Universal health coverage: moving together to build a healthier world”, !

Also reaffirms that each country must take primary responsibility for its own sustainable development and that the role of national policies and development strategies for the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication cannot be overemphasized, and recognizes that increased effective national efforts should be complemented by concrete, effective and supportive international programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership strategies and sovereignty; 5. Notes that the world as a whole is not on track to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030, and stresses the resolve to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere as well as the efforts to reduce, at least by half, the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its forms and dimensions, according to national definitions; 6. Expresses its deep concern that, while there has been progress in reducing poverty, such progress remains uneven, with 1.3 billion people in 107 developing countries still living in multidimensional poverty, this number continues to be significant and unacceptably high, the levels of inequality in income, wealth and opportunities remain high or are increasing within and between many countries, and the non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major concerns; 7. Recognizes that, despite its devastating impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to put forward policies for a better and sustainable recovery, including by reallocating public resources to protect people living in poverty and in vulnerable situations through the provision of adequate social protection, high-quality health care and education and decent jobs, in this context welcomes the convening of the high-level event on jobs and social protection for poverty eradication by the Secretary - General on 28 September 2021, takes note of the United Nations Food Systems Summit, held on 23 September 2021, and recalls the Secretary-General’s call'’ for a coordinated and comprehensive multilateral solidarity response amounting to at least 10 per cent of global gross domestic product, which can help developing countries to respond to the immediate health threat posed by the pandemic and its multifaceted effects; 8.

Also calls upon the international community, including Member States, to continue their ambitious efforts to strive for more inclusive, equitable, balanced, stable and development-oriented sustainable socioeconomic approaches to overcoming poverty, and, in view of the negative impact of all forms of inequality, including gender inequality and inequality within and between countries, on poverty, emphasizes the importance of structural transformation that leads to inclusive and sustainable industrialization for employment creation and poverty reduction, investing in sustainable agriculture and develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all, enhancing interconnectivity and achieving access to energy, and improving access to financial services, as well as promoting decent work in the rural economy, improving access to quality education, promoting quality health-care services, including through the acceleration of the transition towards equitable access to universal health coverage, providing affordable and secure housing for people in vulnerable situations, advancing gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, expanding social protection coverage, climate change mitigation and adaptation and combating inequality within and between countries and social exclusion, especially of the furthest behind; 10. Recognizes that poverty reduction requires increasing productive capacity in developing countries, and in this regard commits to strengthening cooperation, including by increasing the allocation of the necessary means of implementation such as financing, technology transfers and capacity-building, so as to, inter alia, accelerate industrialization and modernization, expand the production of vaccines, medical equipment and agricultural and industrial goods and strengthen the services sector, with a view to achieving greater economic diversification and technological development and innovation, while promoting job and wealth creation, and generating fiscal resources for the promotion of public policies to combat inequality and eradicate poverty, in particular extreme poverty; 11. Also recognizes the urgent need to address poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, which will lead to rich payoffs across the Sustainable Development Goals, and encourages the international community to enhance international cooperation and to devote resources to developing rural and urban areas and sustainable agriculture and fisheries and to supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, herders and fishers in developing countries, particularly in the least developed countries; 12. Invites all relevant stakeholders, including organizations of the United Nations system and civil society organizations, to share good practices relating to programmes and policies that address inequalities for the benefit of those living in extreme poverty and promote the active participation of those living in extreme poverty in the design and implementation of such programmes and policies, with the aim of achieving the 2030 Agenda; 7/12 13.

Stresses the importance of using multidimensional indicators and developing transparent measurements of progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product in order to effectively reflect the reality of the populations of all developing countries, eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, and reduce inequality everywhere, in accordance with the 2030 Agenda, and encourages the United Nations system to continue to support developing countries in capacity development in such areas as building national statistical systems, data analysis and disaggregation, policy formulation and the mainstreaming of the Sustainable Development Goals into national development plans and strategies; 23. Recognizes that social and economic development depends on the sustainable management of the natural resources of the planet, and stresses the importance of conserving and sustainably using oceans and seas, freshwater resources, forests, mountains and drylands and protecting biodiversity, ecosystems and wildlife, as well as promoting sustainable tourism, tackling water scarcity and water pollution, strengthening cooperation on desertification, dust storms, degraded land and soil and drought, promoting resilience and disaster risk reduction, addressing decisively the threat posed by climate change and environmental degradation and implementing the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns; '3 9/12 24. Also recognizes that sustainable, inclusive, sustained and equitable economic growth is essential for eradicating poverty and hunger, in particular in developing countries, and stresses that national efforts in this regard should be complemented by an enabling international environment and by ensuring greater coherence among macroeconomic and social policies at all levels; 25. Stresses the importance of policies and actions that are not just gender- responsive but that actively seek to advance the goal of gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment as well as to address longer-term structural issues, including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, and to remove any barriers that prevent women from being full participants in the economy, by, inter alia, undertaking legislation and administrative reforms, as appropriate, to give women equal rights with men in political and economic decision-making and access to economic resources and to promote the reconciliation of work and family responsibilities, including through paid maternity and parental leave and the redistribution of the disproportionate work burden of women engaged in unpaid work, including domestic and care work, encourages the private sector, in accordance with national legislation, to contribute to advancing gender equality by striving to ensure women’s full and productive employment and decent work, equal pay for equal work or work of equal value and equal opportunities, as well as by protecting them against discrimination and abuse in the workplace, and underlines that globally, gross domestic product could increase significantly if every country achieved gender equality and increased participation of women in the formal labour force; 26. Emphasizes the reference in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to the need to ensure the significant mobilization of financial and non-financial resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, as well as regional, subregional and interregional cooperation, in order to provide predictable means for all developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions; 27. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the eradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to effectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil official development assistance (ODA) commitments and use ODA effectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology, on mutually agreed terms, to developing countries, also stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt situations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances, the transaction costs for which should be reduced, have become a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development; 28. Welcomes the increasing efforts to improve the quality of ODA and to increase its development impact, recognizes the Development Cooperation Forum of the Economic and Social Council, notes other initiatives, such as the high-level forums on aid effectiveness, which produced, inter alia, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Accra Agenda for Action'® and the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, which make important contributions to the efforts of the countries that have made commitments to them, including through the adoption of their fundamental principles, and bears in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all formula that will guarantee effective assistance and that the specific situation of each country needs to be fully considered; 29. Recognizes that domestic resource mobilization, underscored by the principle of national ownership and supplemented by international assistance, as 10/12 appropriate, will be critical to realizing sustainable development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals; 30. Emphasizes that international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources; 31. Recognizes that private business activity, entrepreneurship, investment and innovation are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation and that private international capital flows, particularly foreign direct investment, along with a stable international financial system, are vital complements to national development efforts, also recognizes that more can be done to create competitive business and investment climates in support of sustainable development that are well placed to attract private sector investment and participation, and encourages an increase in the volume, quality, in particular its alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals, diversification and long-term nature of foreign direct investment to all developing countries; 32. Notes that an important use of international public finance, including ODA, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and private, and through appropriately designed risk-sharing instruments, including co-investments, public-private partnerships and guarantees, and also notes that it can support improved tax collection, help to strengthen domestic enabling environments and build essential public services and can also be used to unlock additional finance through blended or pooled financing and risk mitigation, notably for infrastructure and other investments that support private sector development; 33. Stresses the importance of mobilizing greater domestic support towards the fulfilment of ODA commitments, including by raising public awareness, providing disaggregated data on aid effectiveness and demonstrating tangible results, encourages partner countries to build on progress achieved in ensuring that ODA is used effectively to help to achieve development goals and targets, also encourages the publication of forward-looking plans that increase the clarity, predictability and transparency of future development cooperation, in accordance with national budget allocation processes, and urges countries to track and report resource allocations for advancing gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 34. Expresses its concern that, according to preliminary data in 2020, even though ODA rose by 3.5 per cent, compared with 2019, and bilateral (country-to- country) aid to least developed countries rose by 1.8 per cent, ODA was, on average, 0.32 per cent of the aggregate donor gross national income, below the commitment of 0.7 per cent, reiterates that the fulfilment of all ODA commitments remains crucial and that, for many least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, ODA remains the largest source of external financing, therefore emphasizes the importance of the commitments made by many countries to achieve the national target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for ODA to the least developed countries, and calls upon developed countries to deliver on their commitments in relation to ODA; 35. Encourages all relevant stakeholders, as appropriate, to strengthen United Nations funding for the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, through voluntary contributions to existing poverty- related system-wide funds; 36. Welcomes the ongoing work by the relevant organizations of the United Nations system to support the implementation of the Third Decade, acknowledges the complexity of the challenge of poverty eradication, in this regard emphasizes the need 11/12 to strengthen the leadership role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for development in accelerating poverty eradication and effectively implementing the Third Decade, and that the organizations of the United Nations development system must be driven by national priorities, including through the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, with the development of national capacities and development strategies in developing countries continuing to be a core area of focus, and operate in an integrated, coordinated and coherent manner, through development programmes and projects that address poverty eradication as their underlying objective, within their respective mandates, in order to ensure that gains are irreversible, making full use of the interlinked and mutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations development system, and encourages the use of diverse strategies; 37. Calls upon the international community to give priority to addressing the impacts of natural disasters, climate change, conflicts and major outbreaks of disease, which are severely hampering efforts to achieve poverty eradication, in particular in developing countries; 38. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and challenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income countries and countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered and addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a view to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual countries; 39. Welcomes the twenty-ninth commemoration, on 17 October 2021, of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, invites all States, organizations of the United Nations system, intergovernmental organizations concerned and interested national organizations, including non-governmental organizations, to consider organizing activities for the thirtieth commemoration, in 2022, of the International Day, in order to raise public awareness of efforts to promote the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty in all countries, and in this regard recognizes the useful role that the observance of the International Day continues to play in raising public awareness and mobilizing all stakeholders in the fight against poverty and promoting the active participation of those living in extreme poverty in the design and implementation of programmes and policies that affect them, with the aim of achieving the 2030 Agenda; 40. Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session a report on the gaps, challenges and progress made in the implementation of the Third Decade, including COVID-19-related aspects, effects and response, and decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-seventh session, under the item entitled “Eradication of poverty and other development issues”, the sub-item entitled “Implementation of the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2018-2027)”, unless otherwise agreed. 21-14609 12/12",10/11/2021,2021_3943835,Guinea,"* On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 77 and China. !

the eradication of poverty, in all its forms 2 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 3 Resolution 71/256, annex. 2/8 and dimensions, particularly in rural areas, where most of the extreme poor live, stressing that global inequities in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, with the bulk of vaccines disproportionately available to developed countries, which are on track to vaccinate their entire population, in contrast with the low availability of COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries, further put at risk the health of the rural poor, in this regard welcoming the Sustainable Development Goals Moment placing an emphasis on poverty and inequality, on climate change and a healthy planet and on achieving gender equality, taking note of the efforts of the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session to launch the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, which is timely and meaningful and continues to serve as a platform for the exchange of ideas, policies and best practices on poverty eradication, and stressing the importance of addressing poverty, including rural poverty issues, in these forums, as the rural poor might be less prepared to deal with the effects of and recover from the COVID-19 crisis and could have less access to adequate sanitation, food and nutrition, health-care services, education, the Internet, information and communications technology, social protection, financial services and public infrastructure, Commending the efforts and remarkable progress achieved by developing countries in eradicating rural poverty, while noting with concern that key gaps still remain, such as: a lack of adequate data; inadequate investment in agricultural and rural development; lower and inadequate human capital formation relevant for rural livelihoods; scarce non-farm income-generating opportunities; a lack of productive capacity and agricultural transformation; persistent gender inequality; a lack of social protection; insufficient basic infrastructure and services; a lack of or poor adaptive capacity and resilience to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and disasters; and a lack of effective rural institutions and of sufficient resources, Recognizing the leading role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, together with other United Nations entities, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Development Programme, in the global efforts to reduce rural poverty, while addressing other interlinked challenges such as eliminating hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition and increasing the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises, Noting with appreciation the aspirations, embedded in Agenda 2063 of the African Union, to lift huge sections of the population out of poverty, improve incomes and catalyse economic and social transformation, and recognizing the importance of the international community’s helping African countries to achieve such goals, especially in the rural areas of the African continent, Noting that, while considerable progress has been made over the past decade across all areas of development, the pace of progress observed in recent years is insufficient and uneven to fully meet the Sustainable Development Goals and targets by 2030, especially in the area of rural poverty eradication, Recognizing that poverty is a serious impediment to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including those living in rural areas, and that the feminization of poverty persists, emphasizing that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, acknowledging the mutually reinforcing links between the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and the eradication of poverty, and stressing the importance of support for countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, Emphasizing that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda depends crucially on the transformation of rural areas, where most of the poor and hungry live, and that, in order to eradicate rural poverty, investment should be channelled towards sectors that 3/8 have a bigger impact, such as education and health, agriculture and infrastructure, while noting an annual financing gap for reaching universal pre-primary, primary and secondary education of good quality in low-income and lower middle-income countries of 44 billion United States dollars over the period 2015-2030, and that at least 80 billion dollars in annual investment will be needed to meet the demand for food that is projected to increase by 70 per cent by 2050, and that the investments that are needed for climate change mitigation and adaptation also remain underfunded, Welcoming the proclamation of 2019-2028 as the United Nations Decade of Family Farming, to raise the profile of the role of family farming*in contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and reaffirming the importance of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025) in the promotion of activities towards the eradication of rural poverty, Recognizing the interlinkages and integrated nature of the Sustainable Development Goals, and reiterating that the eradication of rural poverty and hunger is crucial for the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the 2030 Agenda, and that rural development should be pursued through an integrated approach which encompasses economic, social and environmental dimensions, takes into account a gender perspective and consists of mutually reinforcing policies and programmes, and which should be balanced, targeted, situation-specific and locally owned, include local synergies and initiatives and be responsive to the needs of rural populations, Recalling that about 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work in agriculture, that the extreme poverty rate in rural areas is three times higher than in urban areas and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, improving the welfare of farmers, Taking into consideration the increasing number of young people who decide to leave rural areas for more urbanized ones and the challenges that this trend poses to the livelihood of rural families, Expressing its concern that the extreme poor have limited access to productive resources, basic health, education and social protection services, basic infrastructure such as roads, water and electricity, and off-farm employment opportunities, and are susceptible to the impacts of natural disasters, especially weather-related hazards, including the El Nifio phenomenon, and the adverse effects of climate change, and that rural women and girls fare far worse on most development indicators, Emphasizing the importance of enhancing global support for national work on rural development policies and strategies, including on commodity production as well as increased public and private investments to upgrade productive capacity, and that tackling rural poverty requires integrated, cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder and context-specific interventions, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food and agricultural systems for food security, nutrition, economic growth, revitalization and development in rural areas, 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General® and the recommendations contained therein; 2.

Expresses its deep concern that the progress in reducing poverty remains uneven, with 1.3 billion people still living in multidimensional poverty, and that this number continues to be significant and unacceptably high, whereas the levels of inequality in income, wealth and opportunities remain high or are increasing in a number of countries, and the non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major concerns, and stresses the importance of national and global efforts to create conditions for sustainable development, inclusive and sustained economic growth, shared prosperity and decent work for all in society, taking into account different levels of national development capacities; 4. Recognizes the importance of promoting socioeconomic development in rural areas as an effective strategy and important means at the global level for the eradication of poverty, including extreme poverty, and therefore underlines the importance of shaping a rural poverty eradication pattern with the concerted efforts of the whole of society to promote socioeconomic development in rural areas; 5. Emphasizes that economic growth continues to leave rural dwellers behind, that, circa 2018, 80 per cent of the people living in extreme poverty lived in rural areas and 40.2 per cent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lived on less than 1.90 dollars per day in 2018, and recommends that countries promote dedicated and coordinated social, economic, agricultural and rural development in their national policies, including by adopting rural-focused poverty eradication strategies in alignment with the 2030 Agenda, social policies aimed at improving human capital in rural areas and ensuring access to adequate social protection coverage, agricultural policies aimed at boosting agricultural productivity, and rural development policies aimed at improving access to rural infrastructure and basic services of high quality and at boosting non-farm employment opportunities; 6.

Recognizes that eradicating poverty in rural areas cannot be separated from the food systems transformation and that ensuring fair markets that enable the participation of smallholder and family farmers in food systems, particularly in value chains where small-scale producers have a comparative advantage, will continue to be important, in this regard takes note with appreciation of the Food Systems Summit, held in 2021, which recognized the transformative effects of food systems as a driver for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, underscores that open, non-discriminatory, transparent, rules-based trade is essential for building more inclusive and resilient food systems, and calls upon all countries to promote agricultural and rural development in their national policies, renew their efforts towards achieving more modern and sustainable agrifood systems, including sustainable production, significantly reducing food loss and waste, and strengthen policies that support small-scale producers in engaging in agrifood system value chains and gaining access to productive services; 10. Also recognizes the importance of employment for pro-poor growth in rural areas, and encourages the United Nations system and development partners to assist countries, upon their request, in mainstreaming employment into investment policy and poverty reduction strategies, including those focused on rural area development, and fostering rapid agricultural productivity growth, especially in developing countries, by increasing investment in agricultural and related rural off-farm activities; 11. Further recognizes the need to design, implement and pursue gender- responsive economic and social policies aimed at, inter alia, eradicating poverty, including in rural areas, and combating the feminization of poverty, ensuring the full and equal participation of rural women in the development, implementation and follow-up of development policies and programmes and poverty eradication strategies, supporting increased rural employment and decent work, and promoting the participation of women at all levels and sectors of the rural economy and in diverse on-farm and off-farm economic activities, including sustainable agricultural and fisheries production; 12. Encourages Member States, international organizations, the private sector and other partners to develop programmes to foster the creation of decent work in rural areas and increase the investment in agricultural and related off-farm activities, especially for young people; 13. Emphasizes that, globally, 2 billion people, primarily in rural areas in developing countries, do not have access to formal financial services, and encourages further efforts of the international community to offer affordable ways to access finance for the financially excluded in rural areas; 14.

Reiterates the need for enhanced and expanded access by developing countries to appropriate technologies that are pro-poor and raise productivity, and underlines the need for measures to increase investment in agriculture, including modern technologies, as well as in natural resources management and capacity- building of developing countries; 17. Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the eradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to effectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil official development assistance commitments and use official development assistance effectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology to developing countries, on mutually agreed terms, and further stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt situations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have become a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development; 18. Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and challenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income countries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered and addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a view to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual countries; 19. Realizes that bridging the digital divide will require strong commitment by all relevant stakeholders at the national and international levels, reiterates the importance of investing in infrastructure for greater access to affordable technological devices and services for rural populations, which includes leveraging technology- enabled financial services and financial technologies to promote financial inclusion, and encourages efforts by all relevant stakeholders, especially United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, in the spirit of win-win cooperation, to assist developing countries in overcoming the digital divide and promoting the use of information and communication technologies to foster economic and social development, particularly in rural areas, with the aim of building a shared future for humankind; 20.

complex as multiple forms of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, 5/14 underweight, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity, may coexist within the same country or household, Noting with great concern the threat to human health, safety and well-being caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as the severe disruption to societies and economies and the devastating impact on lives and livelihoods, and that the poorest and most vulnerable are the hardest hit by the pandemic, reaffirming the ambition to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by designing sustainable and inclusive recovery strategies to accelerate progress towards the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to help to reduce the risk of future shocks, and recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic requires a global response based on unity, solidarity and renewed multilateral cooperation, [Placeholder for updated COVID-19 paragraph] Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic, its impacts and the extraordinary measures adopted to combat it, have delivered one of the most devastating blows to global food security and nutrition in recent times, and deeply concerned about the assessment that, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the largest single-year increase in hunger in decades, as many as 161 million more in one year, considering the specific concern of the effect of the pandemic on vulnerable populations in Asia, parts of Latin America and Africa, where malnutrition is estimated to affect one in five people, and deeply concerned also about the estimation that more than 2 billion small producers, farm labourers, family farmers, smallholder farmers and other people in vulnerable situations, as well as women and children, who represent a large proportion of the moderately and severely food insecure, may be disproportionately affected, recognizing that hundreds of millions of people were already suffering from hunger and malnutrition before the virus hit, underlining that the impact of the pandemic is exacerbating existing high levels of acute food insecurity, malnutrition and humanitarian needs, and highlighting the importance of reducing food loss and waste, Recognizing also that economic slowdown, gender inequalities, conflict, drought and the adverse effects of climate change, including more frequent and extreme weather events, are among the key factors contributing to a reversal in the long-term progress in fighting global hunger, making the prospect of ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 more difficult, Remaining deeply concerned about the continuing food insecurity and malnutrition being faced by hundreds of millions of people, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, in South and West Asia and in parts of Latin America, Recognizing the need to prevent the recurrence in the future of deaths of people from famine, Expressing its concern about the growing number of obese adults in the world, with prevalence at 13.1 per cent in 2016, Expressing concern that, according to the Global Report on Food Crises 2021, about 155 million people face crisis-level food insecurity or worse in countries affected by, inter alia, conflict, and exacerbated by climate-related events, environmental factors, including natural disasters such as locust infestation, and extreme food price volatility, Noting that an increasing number of countries, in particular in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific, are integrating food security and nutrition into their agriculture policies and investment plans and that, as a result, eradicating hunger, improving food security and ensuring adequate nutrition are being given greater 6/14 prominence in regional development strategies, such as the African Union Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations food security and nutrition strategy, the Piura Declaration on Food Security, the Framework for Multi-Year Programme on Food Security and Climate Change and the Strategic Framework on Rural-Urban Development to Strengthen Food Security and Quality Growth, adopted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Hunger-Free Latin America and the Caribbean 2025 Initiative, the strategy on food security and nutrition of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the Arab food security initiative, the initiative for the Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change and the climate-smart agriculture strategy for the Central American Integration System region (2018-2030), all of which emphasized the importance of investing in agriculture, diversifying food production and diets and providing quality nutritional education to consumers, introducing labour-saving technologies in food production and processing, enhancing women’s access to income and strengthening capacity-building in improving food safety at all stages of the food chain, and noting also the establishment of the Islamic Organization for Food Security, headquartered in Nur-Sultan, Reiterating the urgent need for action to enhance efforts to build resilience, especially for the most vulnerable, by investing in resilience, including disaster risk reduction, strengthening adaptation strategies and enhancing joint risk assessments and risk management strategies, to cut the impact and cost of natural disasters to address the adverse effects of climate change on food security, in particular for women, youth, older persons, indigenous peoples, local communities and persons with disabilities, as well as the other root causes of food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, Expressing concern that climate change will disproportionately impact people in vulnerable situations, especially women and children, and their livelihoods, ultimately putting hundreds of millions of people at risk, and that by 2050, the risk of hunger and child malnutrition could increase by up to 20 per cent owing to climate change, Reiterating the importance of achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, as well as the recognition and protection of the rights of smallholders, particularly women, reiterating also the importance, inter alia, of supporting the empowerment of rural women, youth, small-scale farmers, family farmers and livestock farmers, fishers and fish workers as critical agents for enhancing agricultural and rural development and food security and for improving nutrition outcomes, and acknowledging their fundamental contribution to the environmental sustainability and the genetic preservation of agricultural systems and to sustaining productivity on often marginal lands, Recognizing that livestock contributes 40 per cent of the global value of agricultural output and supports the livelihoods and food security of almost 1.3 billion people, and in this regard acknowledging that the sector offers opportunities for agricultural development, poverty eradication and food security gains, and offers an opportunity for raising climate awareness, Acknowledging that social protection programmes and measures are effective in reducing poverty and hunger, Noting the importance of initiatives under the United Nations system, including the observance of World Pulses Day, World Tuna Day, Sustainable Gastronomy Day, World Bee Day, World Food Safety Day, World Soil Day, the International Year of Camelids, the International Year of Plant Health, the

to and fight hunger and malnutrition and to promote rural and urban sustainable development, Recalling the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and its guiding principles,?’ and recalling also its promotion of regular disaster risk preparedness, prevention, response and recovery exercises, at the national and local levels, with a view to ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, including access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as appropriate to local needs, Noting that in 2011, an initial estimate reported that one third of the food produced annually in the world for human consumption, equivalent to some 1.3 billion tons, was lost or wasted, while it is estimated that there are up to 811 million people in the world who are hungry and nearly 149.2 million children under 5 years of age were affected by stunting in 2020, Recalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and acknowledging that reaching Goal 2 and the interlinked targets of other Goals will be critical, inter alia, in ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition, Reiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the recognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see the Goals and targets met

Reaffirms its decision to give consideration, as appropriate, to financial inclusion in the follow-up and review framework of the 2030 Agenda and in the follow-up process of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda; 4. Takes note of the consideration given to financial inclusion in the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2021, stresses that, while financial inclusion has improved in recent years, notably owing to the growth in mobile banking, significant gaps remain within and among developed and developing countries, and remains concerned that, globally, 1.7 billion people do not have access to formal financial services and that, despite increased account ownership among women, the financial inclusion gender gap remains; 5. Notes that mobile phones could continue to strengthen financial inclusion, and in this regard underlines the need for the necessary investments, including in infrastructure, such as reliable electricity and network connections, as well as in payment systems and other financial infrastructure, and encourages Member States to take policy actions in accordance with national circumstances and priorities; 6. Acknowledges the important role that national financial inclusion strategies can play in identifying and overcoming financing gaps and binding constraints, including the lack of access to finance for micro-, small and medium- sized enterprises, notes that at least 69 countries have adopted or are in the process of developing financial inclusion strategies, and in this regard encourages Member States to consider the convenience of adopting and pursuing national financial inclusion strategies and gender-responsive strategies, to end the structural barriers to women’s equal access to economic resources and to expand peer learning, experience- sharing and capacity-building among countries and regions in this respect; 7. Recognizes that digitally enabled innovation in the financial sector has contributed significantly to the rapid expansion of access to financial services and financial inclusion, enabling progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and showing impacts across the 2030 Agenda, as outlined in the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2021, and supports concrete actions to advance digital financial inclusion and close digital divides, including the gender digital divide, across and within countries, while improving responsible digital financial practices and promoting regulatory responses, as appropriate, to protect consumers’ interests, financial integrity and system stability, which are mutually reinforcing and also enablers of greater financial inclusion; 8.

Encourages the use of digital financial technologies and services which have gained further importance during the pandemic and have allowed many households and micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises to access financial services despite lockdowns and social distancing; considers that digital financial inclusion is associated with higher gross domestic product growth and that the adoption of digital payments is significantly and positively associated with growth, consistent with the notion that financial technologies may contribute to growth and thus play an important role in mitigating the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and support the recovery; and in that regard also promotes financial innovation and its role in enhancing financial inclusion and fostering more inclusive and equitable access to the benefits of the emerging digital economy; 10. [Invites further use of digital financial technologies in the delivery of government assistance in an effective and secure manner, taking into account that during the COVID-19 health crisis digital financial services enabled contactless and cashless transactions and that where digital financial inclusion is advanced, the efficient and quick deployment of government support measures is benefiting firms and people, including the most poor and vulnerable, which are affected disproportionately by the pandemic, in turn allowing Governments to expand the reach of their emergency responses to those in the informal sector and those who do not have access to bank accounts, while functioning as an enabler of development goals, including eradicating poverty, creating jobs and promoting gender equality and in that regard calls for the building of digital financial infrastructure; 11. Acknowledges that, in the absence of strong financial consumer protection, the growth-enhancing benefits of expanded financial inclusion may be lost or severely undermined, and in this regard stresses the importance of scaled-up action to improve financial and digital literacy and effective consumer protection for the poorest and most vulnerable, including for women, young people, rural residents and migrants; 12. Also acknowledges the efforts and actions on financial inclusion for sustainable development undertaken by a wide range of stakeholders working in partnership, such as the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, the Better Than Cash Alliance, the Special Advocate of the Secretary-General for Inclusive Finance for Development and the Group of 20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, urges them to engage in an inclusive and transparent manner with Member States in their work, in order to ensure that their initiatives complement or strengthen the United Nations system, including the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the regional commissions, and encourages enhanced coordination and cooperation with the Inter-Agency Task Force on Financing for Development; 13.

Looks forward to the continuing consideration of financial inclusion in the forthcoming reports of the Inter-Agency Task Force on financing for sustainable development, as appropriate and in accordance with existing mandates, as well as in the annual report of the Secretary-General on progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and to the further consideration of financial inclusion for sustainable development at the 2022 Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up; 16.

practices as well as initiatives that add value to outputs from small-scale fishers, and noting that, in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019: Safeguarding against FEconomic Slowdowns and Downturns, the Food and Agriculture Organization highlighted that 80 per cent of the countries — 52 out of 65 — with a rise in hunger and an increase in undernourishment during recent

playing as an institution in looking at the interaction between commodity markets and economic development and in the elaboration of the concept of commodity-dependent developing countries, Underlining the importance of advancing sustainable consumption and production patterns, Noting with concern that the prices of most commodities exhibited a downward trend, driven by a variety of factors relating to supply and demand and changing inventories, Recognizing that commodity price volatility, including excessive volatility, can have adverse impacts on both producer and consumer countries, particularly in commodity-dependent countries, and noting with concern that this can undermine their development efforts, as it could discourage investment, widen trade deficits and aggravate household poverty, Noting that commodity price movements have both macroeconomic and microeconomic implications for commodity-dependent developing countries, as well as net commodity-importing developing countries, and further noting that rises in commodity prices may contribute to improvements by exporting countries in their export and fiscal revenue, allowing them to increase current and capital government expenditure, and that, by contrast, a decline in commodity prices may lead to shortfalls in export and fiscal earnings and the inability of Governments to deliver basic goods and services, [Cross-cutting para on Covid-19] Noting that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered a humanitarian and socioeconomic crisis that is devastating societies and reversing vital gains made 3/8 in human development and sustainable development goals, that since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 5 million people have lost their lives, global gross domestic product contracted severely in 2020, millions of people have lost their jobs, and millions more have had their livelihoods compromised, that, most disturbingly, more than 150 million people are expected to join the ranks of extreme poverty by the end of 2021, that countries dependent on commodities exports or on a limited number of economic activities have been particularly hard hit, and that the pandemic has also led to severe commodity price variations, which have deepened the challenges faced by commodity-dependent countries, Expressing concern that the global economy has yet to recover completely and remains in a challenging phase, notwithstanding the recent cyclical pickup in global economic activity, that growth remains weak in many countries and includes subdued trade growth, volatile capital flows, widespread fiscal strains and unsustainable debt in some countries, particularly developing countries, and that commodity exporters are particularly hard hit owing to their continued adjustment to a sharp step-down in foreign earnings, recognizing that, while short-term risks are broadly balanced, medium-term risks are still tilted to the downside, and in this regard stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances, to reform and strengthen the international financial system and to make further progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand, Recognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, especially on women, girls, young people and people in vulnerable situations, Recognizing also that the structural constraints that women face as economic agents, including segmentation in low-value-added or subsistence-oriented work, unequal access to productive resources, limited access to training and skill-building due to gender segmentation in education and labour markets and a lack of resources, as well as the heavy burden of unpaid work, make women and girls especially vulnerable to the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify commodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development and poverty eradication strategies at all levels, Recognizing that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need to comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique, inter alia, the demand for commodities, supply capacities, commodity revenues and investments in commodity-dependent economies, while taking due account of the diversity of each country’s individual situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable development, and to strengthen the nexus between, inter alia, trade, finance, investment in sustainable agriculture and food systems, energy and industrialization, Noting the work on consensus-building on commodity-related issues achieved through meetings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, including the multi-year expert meetings on commodities and development, the Global Commodities Forum and the African Oil, Gas and Mines Trade and Finance Conference and Exhibition, Underlining the importance of timely, accurate and transparent information to ensure the proper

the public dissemination of timely and quality food market information products, Expressing deep concern at the adverse impact of climate change and extreme weather patterns on access to, and the utilization and prices of, agricultural commodities, while recognizing the important role of land and sustainable land management in the climate system, 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on world commodity trends and prospects; '3 2. Recognizes the interlinkage between the adequate and transparent functioning of commodity markets and the capacity of some commodity-dependent developing countries to collect appropriate fiscal revenues from commodity exports and mobilize domestic resources to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and their sustainable development, including through sustainable and inclusive economic growth, industrialization, decent work and market diversification; 3. Encourages support for developing countries, according to their national plans and policies, through technical assistance, to increase their capacity in detecting and averting trade mispricing in their commodities sectors in order to enhance their benefits from those sectors to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals; 4. Reiterates the need for further efforts to address excessive commodity price volatility, in particular by assisting producers, especially small-scale producers, including women, in accordance with national plans and policies, in managing risk; 5. Stresses that developing countries, including African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, face particular challenges as lower prices for the commodities that they produce threaten the sustainable growth and the debt positions of such countries, and therefore notes that, in this context, economic and export diversification, value addition and industrialization can contribute to strengthening resilience to excessive price volatility by allowing the derivation of revenue from various sources; 6. Recognizes the need to continue efforts to diversify economies, as well as to improve the regulation, where appropriate, and the efficiency, responsiveness, functioning and transparency of financial and commodity markets nationally, regionally and internationally; 7. Acknowledges two main diversification strategies, one being horizontal diversification to export different types of commodities and other products to different markets, and the other being vertical diversification through value addition, and notes that these diversification strategies can contribute to creating sustained jobs and foster an inclusive and sustainable process of industrialization in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; 8. Recognizes the relationship between technological change, innovation, economic diversification and structural transformation, and notes with concern that most commodity-dependent developing countries have made minimal gains in closing technological gaps in the past 25 years; 9. Encourages Member States, development partners and the private sector to promote economic diversification in commodity-dependent countries by means of investments in productive capacity, physical capital accumulation, human 5/8 capacity-building, infrastructure, the improvement of science and technology capabilities and the strengthening of institutions and governance; 10. Calls upon the international community to support the efforts of and foster cooperation with commodity-dependent developing countries to address the factors that create structural barriers to international trade and impede, inter alia, diversification, including tariff and non-tariff barriers, limited access to financial services resulting in scarce resources for investing in the commodity sector, weak infrastructure, particularly regarding both the cost and availability of transportation and storage, and lack of skills in producing and marketing alternative products; 11. Emphasizes the importance of enhanced collaboration between the public and private sectors and high levels of investment in commodity-dependent developing countries to promote diversification and upgrade productive structures integrated into global value chains for sustainable development; 12. Looks forward to the convening of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization from 30 November to 3 December 2021 in Geneva,; 13. Notes with concern that the slow and uneven recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic particularly harms commodity-dependent developing countries, and acknowledges that international trade can play a role in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development!* and sustainable, robust and balanced growth for all; 14. Calls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and international levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity- dependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, in particular by facilitating value addition and enhancing their participation in commodity and related product value chains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these economies and by encouraging the use and further development of market-oriented risk management tools, instruments and strategies; 15. Stresses the importance of developing and strengthening agricultural policies and strategies that recognize and address women’s critical role in food security and improved nutrition outcomes as an integral part of both short- and long- term responses to food insecurity and malnutrition and food crises in developing countries; 16. Recognizes the potential for innovation, productivity improvements and the promotion of non-traditional exports in most commodity-dependent developing countries, particularly in Africa, and calls for enhanced support by the international community as well as exchanges of experience in these areas within the framework of South-South economic cooperation; 17. Underscores the importance of increased investments in quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure as a means of promoting sustainable agricultural development and enhancing commodity diversification, including value- added production, and trade, and urges the international community to assist commodity-dependent developing countries to mainstream trade as well as sound investment and financial policies as key elements of development strategies, based on national circumstances and development priorities, and to invest in and support research, innovation and development of sustainable agriculture productivity; 18. Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at improving the commodity export competitiveness of producers are particularly important for developing countries, especially in Africa, and invites Member States 6/8 and all relevant stakeholders to provide the necessary resources for commodity- specific financial and technical assistance, in particular for human and institutional capacity-building, including gender-responsive measures, as well as quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure development of developing countries, with a view to reducing their institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing their commodity trade and development in accordance with national development plans; 19. Also stresses that the Aid for Trade initiative should aim to help developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, to build the supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructure that they need to assist them to implement and benefit from World Trade Organization agreements and, more broadly, to expand their trade; 20. Recalls the agreement to keep under regular review, by the Ministerial Conference and appropriate bodies of the World Trade Organization, the impact of the results of the Uruguay Round on the least developed countries as well as on the net food-importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures to enable them to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard calls for the implementation of the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries; 21. FEncourages developed countries that have not already done so and developing countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards the goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005; 22. Strongly encourages international financial institutions and development banks to assist developing countries, in particular commodity-dependent developing countries, in managing the effects of commodity price volatility, including excessive volatility; 23.

See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. 2 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1771, No. 30822. 2/10 to even mildly adverse economic developments, or the perception of such, in financial markets, Underlining that, globally, the gross domestic product growth rate could increase significantly if every country achieved gender equality, and recognizing that the economic and social losses owing to a lack of progress in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are significant, Recognizing with concern that, in 2020, the external debt positions of many developing countries had continued to deteriorate, with external debt stocks growing by 500 billion United States dollars in 2020 to reach a new record level of 11.3 trillion dollars, that the average ratio of total external debt to gross domestic product rose from 29.9 per cent in 2019 to 32.5 per cent in 2020 and that the cost of servicing external debt obligations now amounts, on average, to 15.8 per cent of developing countries’ export earnings, the highest level since 2002, as stated in the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,’ Recognizing with concern also that small island developing States saw their external debt position deteriorate very seriously in 2020, reaching new record levels of 54.7 billion dollars and raising the ratio of debt service costs to export revenues from 20.1 per cent in 2019 to 34.1 per cent in 2020, Recognizing with concern further that total external debt stocks in middle- income countries, excluding small island developing States, continued to grow in 2020 to 2.35 trillion dollars, or 32.2 per cent of their gross domestic product, 148.2 per cent of their export earnings, that the ratio of debt service to export revenues rose from 14.9 per cent in 2019 to 17.5 per cent in 2020 and that the debt of middle- income countries is not only growing at a faster pace than anticipated but is a more costly debt with a shorter maturity, Recognizing the important role, on a case-by-case basis, of debt relief, including debt cancellation, as appropriate, and debt restructuring as debt crisis prevention, management and resolution tools, Recalling the Sendai Declaration and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030,° reiterating that severe natural disasters and social or economic shocks can

or a tsunami and in the context of the Ebola crisis in West Africa, noting the debt swap initiative of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Debt for Climate Adaptation Swap, and encouraging consideration of further debt relief steps, such as the use of sovereign contingent debt instruments, where appropriate, and/or other measures for countries affected in this regard, as feasible, Expressing deep concern that a number of countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as a growing number of middle- income countries, face challenges in servicing their debt and that, in spite of international efforts, a growing number of developing countries continue to struggle with high debt burdens and are classified, in accordance with the debt sustainability assessments, as being in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress, Recognizing with concern that, prior to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, total external debt stocks of developing countries reached a new record of 10 trillion dollars, and rising external debt burdens continued to absorb a growing 5 See A/76/214. % Resolution 69/283, annexes I and II. 3/10 share of developing countries’ resources and simultaneously the ability of developing countries to self-insure against exogenous shocks, and increased market risk through international reserve cushions continued to weaken, recognizing with concern also that external debt sustainability, in particular in the most vulnerable and in middle- income countries, has continued to deteriorate throughout the crisis despite efforts by the Group of 20 bilateral creditors to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on debtor countries’ debt sustainability, noting the meetings of the fourth cluster of the Initiative on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond, co-convened by the Governments of Canada and Jamaica and the Secretary-General, Recognizing the importance of debt sustainability for the smooth transition of countries graduating from least developed country status, as well as those that have already graduated, Emphasizing that international support, in the form of official development assistance and a coordinated multilateral effort to provide low-cost, long-term development financing, as well as enhanced domestic resource mobilization, which is the primary source of financing for development across all country classifications, are needed to address the growing challenges to developing countries’ debt sustainability, Taking note of the operational guidelines for sustainable financing promoted by the Group of 20, while urging the Group to continue to engage in an inclusive and transparent manner with other States Members of the United Nations in its work, in order to ensure that the initiatives of the Group complement or strengthen the United Nations system, and noting the progress achieved in the implementation of the operational guidelines, Noting the need for coordinated efforts by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to

Takes note of the report of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development; 2. Emphasizes the special importance of timely, effective, comprehensive and durable solutions to the debt problems of developing countries to promote their economic growth and development; 3. Recognizes the importance, in particular, of new and emerging challenges and vulnerabilities in regard to developing country external debt sustainability arising from structural changes to overall debt composition, the rapid growth of private sector debt in many emerging and developing countries and the growing use of new debt financing instruments and approaches; 4. Notes the growing concerns about fast-rising corporate debt, high-risk exposure to volatile international financial markets and fast-growing debt servicing 4/10 burdens as potential triggers of financial and debt crises and the consequent need for coordinated policy responses; 5. Stresses the need to continue to assist developing countries in avoiding a build-up of unsustainable debt so as to reduce the risk of relapsing into another debt crisis, taking into account the challenges posed by the global economic environment and risks for debt sustainability in some developed and developing countries; 6. Acknowledges the role played by the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries, jointly developed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to guide borrowing and lending decisions, and notes its operationalization in 2018 and the further enhancement of debt sustainability assessment frameworks, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’ and longer-term structural transformation; 7. Reiterates that no single indicator should be used to make definitive judgments about a country’s debt sustainability, and, in view of the new challenges and vulnerabilities for developing countries’ external debt sustainability, substantiated by the work of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and recent joint analyses of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, stresses the need for improved data collection and quality in areas that include domestic public debt and domestic and external private debt, as well as legal and regulatory features, such as ownership, currency denomination and jurisdiction according to national priorities; 8. Also reiterates that timely and comprehensive data on the level and composition of debt are necessary for, inter alia, building early warning systems aimed at limiting the impact of debt crises, calls for debtor and creditor countries to intensify their efforts to collect and release data, where appropriate, welcomes the ongoing work of relevant institutions to apply innovative tools for monitoring financial stress in developing countries and to create a central data registry that includes information on debt restructuring, and calls for donors to consider increasing their support for technical cooperation programmes aimed at increasing the statistical capacity of developing countries in that regard; 9. Encourages the United Nations system, the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund and other relevant stakeholders, including the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to continue to conduct analytical activities and to provide policy advice and technical assistance to Governments, upon request, in the areas of managing debt, and operating and maintaining databases, and in this regard recalls that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development should continue its analytical and policy work and technical assistance on debt issues, including the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System Programme, so that this extends not only to improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of debt data recording, but also to the enhanced coverage of public sector and other relevant debt data, including, in particular, heretofore unrecorded or hidden debt instruments, contingent liabilities and more complex debt instruments; 10. Stresses the need to strengthen information-sharing and transparency among all creditors and borrowers to make sure that debt sustainability assessments are based on comprehensive, objective and reliable data, including an assessment of national public and private debt, in order to ensure the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, encourages further improvement of the mutual exchange of information, on a voluntary basis, on borrowing and lending among all creditors and borrowers, and takes note of the Paris Forum initiative, which is aimed at gathering 5/10 together sovereign creditors and debtors to share views and information, promote greater debt transparency and preserve debt sustainability; 11. Recognizes that the long-term sustainability of debt depends on, inter alia, economic growth, the mobilization of domestic and international resources, the export prospects of debtor countries, sustainable debt management, sound macroeconomic policies that also support job creation, transparent and effective regulatory frameworks and success in overcoming structural development problems and, hence, on the creation of an enabling environment at all levels that is conducive to development, and also recognizes the need to assist developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability, through coordinated policies aimed at fostering adequate debt financing and resolution tools, such as debt relief and debt restructuring supporting sound debt management; 12. Notes with concern that some low- and middle-income developing countries that were not part of the existing debt relief initiatives now have large debt burdens that may create constraints on mobilizing the resources needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, indicating a need to consider, as appropriate, stronger debt management initiatives for those countries, and stresses the importance of medium- and long-term debt sustainability to deal with debt, including bilateral and non-Paris Club debt; 13. Underlines the fact that heavily indebted poor countries eligible for debt relief will not be able to enjoy the full benefits unless all creditors, both public and private, contribute to debt workouts, as appropriate, in order to ensure the debt sustainability of those countries, and invites creditors, both private and public, that are not yet fully participating in debt relief initiatives to substantially increase their participation, including by providing comparable treatment, to the extent possible, to debtor countries that have concluded sustainable debt relief agreements with creditors; 14. Stresses the need for the international community to remain vigilant in monitoring the debt situation of developing countries, including the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, and to continue to take effective measures, preferably within existing frameworks, when applicable, to address the debt problem of those countries, acknowledges that sound debt management initiatives can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, and with the promotion of sustained economic growth and development and the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and in this regard urges countries to direct the resources freed through debt relief, in particular through debt cancellation and reduction, towards achieving those objectives, including in the context of the 2030 Agenda, according to their national priorities and strategies; 15. Notes that countries can seek to negotiate, as a last resort, on a case-by- case basis and through existing frameworks, agreements on temporary debt standstills between debtors and creditors in order to help to mitigate the adverse impacts of a debt crisis and stabilize macroeconomic developments; 16. Acknowledges the efforts of, and invites creditors to provide additional flexibility to, developing countries affected by natural disasters so as to allow them to address their national debt concerns, while taking into account their specific economic and social situations and needs; 17. Recognizes that the detrimental impact of disasters on the debt sustainability of many least developed countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries warrants further attention and that preserving external debt 6/10 sustainability requires ex ante financing to enable the systematic reduction of disaster risk and resilience-building, as well as the disclosure of disaster risk to avoid exacerbating debt distress, when feasible, and in this regard recognizes that many least developed countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries have limited access to financing to invest in disaster risk reduction for resilience before and after disasters; 18. Also recognizes that, in some cases, the use of public debt and renewed external borrowing to absorb the impact of a natural disaster could lead to higher debt servicing for developing countries and constrain their growth and their capacity to invest in long-term resilience-building measures, and further acknowledges that, with each new disaster, financial vulnerabilities grow and domestic response capacities weaken; 19. Further recognizes the importance of the creation of robust, nationally appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for sustainable national and municipal borrowing, on the basis of sustainable debt management, supported by adequate revenues and capacities, by means of local creditworthiness, as well as expanded sustainable municipal debt markets, when appropriate, and in this regard underlines the importance of the establishment of appropriate financial intermediaries for urban financing, such as regional, national, subnational and local development funds or development banks, including pooled financing mechanisms, which can catalyse public and private, national and international financing; 20. Underlines the importance of multilateral efforts to tackle increasingly complex cross-border challenges that have serious effects on development and debt sustainability; 21. Recognizes with appreciation the steps taken by the Group of 20, including the extraordinary leaders’ summit hosted by Saudi Arabia on COVID-19 and the work under the presidency of Italy, to provide a time-bound suspension of debt service payments for the poorest countries and a Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, calls for all official bilateral creditors to implement these initiatives fully and in a transparent manner, while noting that more needs to be done, including to respond to the needs of countries not covered by these initiatives, and in this regard reaffirms the growing urgency of dealing not only with liquidity but also solvency risks, recommends (a) the consideration of options to reallocate unutilized and newly allocated special drawing rights of developed countries to developing countries most in need, including middle-income countries, in a manner that avoids further indebtedness, (b) assisting developing countries in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, debt restructuring and sound debt management, as appropriate, to enhance the ability of countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, (c) the facilitation of timely and orderly debt treatment with the broad participation of all creditors, including those in the private sector, on comparable terms, stresses the need in the medium term to strengthen information- sharing between debtors and creditors, as necessary, and long-term debt sustainability analysis, based on comprehensive, objective, transparent and reliable data, while respecting commercially sensitive information, and technical cooperation that takes account of the requirements of sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda, and emphasizes the urgency of strengthening international efforts and cooperation and responding to the call for the easing of debt burdens by addressing the debt vulnerability, in the immediate term, and the debt sustainability, in the long term, of highly indebted developing countries; 22. Recognizes the role of the United Nations and of the international financial institutions, in accordance with their respective mandates, and encourages them to 7/10 continue to support global efforts towards sustained and inclusive growth, sustainable development and the external debt sustainability of developing countries, including through continued monitoring of global financial flows and their implications in this regard; 23. Reiterates that debtors and creditors must work together in a transparent manner to prevent and resolve unsustainable debt situations and that maintaining sustainable debt levels is the responsibility of the borrowing countries, acknowledges that lenders also have a responsibility to lend in a way that does not undermine a country’s debt sustainability, and in this regard takes note of the principles on responsible sovereign lending and borrowing of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, recognizes the applicable requirements of the debt limits policy of the International Monetary Fund and/or the non-concessional borrowing policy of the World Bank and the safeguards of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in its statistical system to enhance the debt sustainability of recipient countries, and resolves to work towards a global consensus on guidelines for debtor and creditor responsibilities in borrowing by and lending to sovereigns, building on existing initiatives; 24. Calls for the intensification of efforts to prevent and mitigate the prevalence and cost of debt crises by enhancing international financial mechanisms for crisis prevention and resolution, encourages the private sector to cooperate in this regard, and invites creditors and debtors to further explore, where appropriate and on a mutually agreed, transparent and case-by-case basis, the use of new and improved debt instruments such as debt swaps, including debt for equity in Sustainable Development Goal projects, as well as debt indexation instruments; 25. Notes with appreciation the holding of the fifteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Barbados and Geneva from 3 to 7 October 2021, and the Bridgetown Covenant, which reinforces the essential role of the Conference in strengthening the voice of developing countries on global economic governance and, in accordance with its mandates, as well as complementing the work done by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, asks the Conference to continue its analytical and policy work and technical assistance on debt issues, including to promote policies for responsible, sustainable and transparent sovereign borrowing and lending, as appropriate, and to enhance the efficiency of the global economic system to address debt sustainability in developing countries; 26. Expresses its concern regarding the ability of non-cooperative minority bondholders to disrupt the will of the large majority of bondholders who accept a restructuring of a debt-crisis country’s obligations, given the potential broader implications in other countries, notes legislative steps taken by certain countries to prevent these activities and encourage all Governments to take action, as appropriate, and, furthermore, takes note of discussions in the United Nations on debt issues; 27. Encourages Governments to be mindful of the ability of non-cooperative minority bondholders to block a restructuring of a debt-crisis country’s obligations, and encourages debtors and creditors to work together to bond agreements accordingly; 28. Welcomes the reforms to pari passu and collective action clauses proposed by the International Capital Market Association and endorsed by the International Monetary Fund to reduce the vulnerability of sovereigns to holdout creditors, encourages countries to take further action to include those clauses in all their bond issuances, and welcomes the continued work of the International Monetary Fund to monitor the uptake of the clauses and explore options for resolving the issue with the outstanding stock of debt without such clauses; 8/10 29. Recalls that the United Nations, as a universal intergovernmental body, provides a platform for both creditors and debtors to discuss ways to improve external debt sustainability, notes the substantive expert debate among the major institutional stakeholders on how to improve debt sustainability and debt restructuring during the 2021 Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up, and in this regard invites continued ongoing cooperation among the international financial institutions, including the Bretton Woods institutions, in particular the International Monetary Fund, relevant United Nations system entities, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and other relevant forums, in accordance with their respective mandates, pursuant to the relevant resolutions on this matter; 30. Also recalls the establishment of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Financing for Development of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, notes its fourth session, held virtually in January 2021, at which developing countries’ voice on international economic governance and on the financing of development, in particular in regard to responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, was an item for deliberation, and recalls the request that the work of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts at the Conference be presented as a regular input to the Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up, in accordance with the terms of reference of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts; 31. Reiterates the invitation to the President of the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to give appropriate consideration to the central role of maintaining and facilitating the financial and macroeconomic stability of developing countries, including debt sustainability, and of supporting an appropriately enabling domestic and international economic, financial and regulatory environment for the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and in this regard invites all major institutional stakeholders, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to support these efforts, in accordance with their respective mandates; 32.

Invites donor countries, taking into account country-specific debt sustainability analyses, to continue their provision of concessional and grant-based financing to developing countries, which could contribute to debt sustainability in the medium to long term, and notes the provision by the International Monetary Fund of interest relief to eligible developing countries in the form of zero-interest loans; 34. Invites the international community to continue efforts to increase support, including financial and technical assistance, for institutional capacity-building in developing countries to enhance sustainable upstream and downstream debt management as an integral part of national development strategies, including by promoting transparent and accountable debt management systems and negotiation and renegotiation capacities and through supporting legal advice in relation to tackling external debt litigation and debt data reconciliation between creditors and debtors so that debt sustainability may be achieved and maintained; 35. Requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and invites the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in cooperation with the regional commissions, regional development banks and other relevant multilateral financial institutions and stakeholders, to continue and intensify cooperation in 9/10 respect of activities relating to capacity-building and to early warning monitoring systems in developing countries in the area of debt management and debt sustainability, with a view to contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; 36. Also requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in cooperation with other relevant international stakeholders, to strengthen its work on the development of frameworks for predictable and comprehensive debt treatment, including debt standstills as a last resort and on a case-by-case basis for highly indebted developing countries, and on the assessment of long-term external financial and debt sustainability, taking account also of the impact of investment requirements arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential similar external shocks to developing countries’ economies in the future; 37.

I, resolution 1, annex II. 2/13 implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, !’ Recognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the education, health and nutrition of the rural poor, especially women and girls, who are often left behind in the implementation of social protection programmes aimed at alleviating rural poverty, and recognizing also that, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, rural and agricultural development aid included only a small fraction of projects aimed at transforming negative gender roles and empowering women and girls in rural areas, Deeply concerned that the extreme situation of girls in child-headed households persists and that poverty, armed conflict, climate-related and other hazards, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, including the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, and other humanitarian emergencies increase the incidence of child-headed households, forcing children, particularly girls living in rural areas, to undertake adult responsibilities, including being the main household earner and caring for younger siblings, and making them particularly vulnerable to poverty, violence, including physical and sexual violence, and discrimination, which seriously inhibits their development and violates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also about the continuing lack of recent information and statistics, disaggregated by sex, on the status of children and their living situation, including those in rural areas, which are necessary to inform appropriate policy responses by Member States and the United Nations system, Concerned that, in sub-Saharan Africa, five out of six new HIV infections among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years are among girls, that adolescent girls and young women aged 15 to 24 years account for 24 per cent of HIV infections despite representing 10 per cent of the population, and that AIDS is the leading cause of death for adolescent girls and women aged between 15 and 49 years, and further noting with concern that rural/urban disaggregated data relating to HIV incidence are scarce, with little information on girls below the age of 15 years, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the unpaid care and domestic work related to the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this also negatively affects girls living in rural areas by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its worst forms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and affected by armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without nationality or birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child labour and that many children face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with unpaid care and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood and hamper the full enjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent employment in the future, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, Recognizing that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence and forced labour, which, among other things, would hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable 3/13 Development Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and the empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing further that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through girls’ organizations with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, including those that disproportionately affect girls, such as child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence, trafficking in persons and the use of information and communications technology and social media to perpetrate violence against women and girls, and, in addition, about the corresponding impunity and lack of accountability, and that violence against women and girls is underrecognized and underreported, particularly at the community level, which reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also by the increased violence against women and girls in the context of confinement measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and emphasizing the need for strengthened prevention and response mechanisms, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, including girls with disabilities and those living in rural and remote areas, bearing in mind their specific needs, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriage, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child, particularly those living in rural areas, to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and childbirth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and 4/13 that of their children, and violates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also that young women and girls are particularly affected by water scarcity, unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene, and concerned furthermore that girls, especially those in rural areas, are often excluded from full and continued participation in school owing to their burden of water procurement at home, a lack of water and sanitation facilities in schools and inadequate access to effective feminine hygiene products, Emphasizing that increased and equal access to quality education for young people, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Recognizing that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from education, and recognizing also that among gendered barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of their right to education are child marriage, early pregnancy, sexual and gender-based violence, the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and gender stereotypes and negative social norms that lead families and communities to place less value on girls’ education when compared with that of boys, Deeply concerned that school-related violence against girls, including sexual violence and harassment on the way to and from and at school, such as violence perpetrated by teachers, continues to deter girls’ education and, in many cases, the transition to and completion of secondary education, and that these risks may influence parents’ decision to allow girls to attend school, Noting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in schools, and recognizing that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and reduce absenteeism, especially for girls living in rural areas, Stressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, the specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources and technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs and priorities of the girl child, 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General; ' 2. Stresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of the child, including the girl child, as provided under international human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocols thereto as a matter of priority; 3. Urges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138),!° and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182),% of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 4. Urges States to develop or review relevant programmes that promote gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and equal access to basic social services, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, birth 18 A/76/204. 19 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1015, No. 14862. 20 Ibid., vol. 2133, No. 37245. 5/13 registration, health care, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the major causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream a gender perspective into all development policies and programmes, including those specific to the girl child; 5. Also urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, including extreme poverty, deprived of adequate food and nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health- care services, shelter, education, participation and protection; 6. Calls upon States and other relevant actors to implement cross-cutting and integrated policies and programmes that tackle all forms of discrimination that are often compounded, against girls in rural areas and that respond to the multidimensional aspects of adolescent girls’ lives, while taking into account the views of girls living in rural areas, in particular with regard to COVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts; 7. Urges States and other relevant actors to strengthen multisectoral child protection systems in rural areas to prevent violence and ensure holistic support for girls who are at greater risk of experiencing, or who have experienced, violence, exploitation and abuse, while paying special attention to girls with disabilities and other marginalized girls living in rural and remote areas; 8. Recognizes that ensuring equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality education requires transformations in education systems, mainstreaming a gender perspective into educational programmes, infrastructure development and teacher training, and in this regard calls upon States to invest in quality education, including through adequate financing, to ensure that all girls, including those who are marginalized or in vulnerable situations, enjoy their right to education; 9. Calls upon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to take steps to bridge the digital divide, including the gender digital divide, as part of the efforts to ensure the empowerment of all women and girls, particularly those living in rural areas; 10. Emphasizes the importance of the right of everyone to education and the continuation of learning, including girls, acknowledging that during the COVID-19 pandemic adolescent girls are at particular risk of dropping out and not returning to school even after the pandemic is over, thereby increasing their vulnerability to poverty, child, early and forced marriage and early pregnancy, calls upon Member States to ensure that girls are protected and supported in returning to school once it is deemed safe to do so, and in this regard calls upon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to take the appropriate measures in order to ensure the availability of learning materials and remote learning platforms during the pandemic, and to bridge the digital divide in order to provide distance learning opportunities, inter alia, Internet, television and radio teaching alternatives, especially in developing countries; 11. Notes the role of the United Nations in supporting national Governments in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development?!' and in realizing girls’ right to education; 12. Calls upon States to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children, including those living in rural areas, and ensuring that all children have equal access to quality education, as well as making secondary and tertiary education available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive 2l Resolution 70/1. 6/13 introduction of free secondary education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, ensuring physical access to education, including by increasing financial incentives to families, improving the safety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring that all schools are accessible, safe, secure and free from violence and providing hygienic, separate and adequate sanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families and children who become heads of households; 13. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive formal education, special initiatives for keeping girls in school through post-primary education, including those who are already married or pregnant, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurship training for young women and to tackle gender stereotypes, in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment and decent work, and equal pay for equal work or work of equal value; 14. Encourages States to adopt, as appropriate, and implement inclusive policies and programmes to promote girls’ education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, including information and communications technology, throughout their education, by, inter alia, expanding the scope of education and training opportunities ranging from basic digital fluency to advanced technical skills, recognizing that girls who develop such skills may enjoy more academic success and higher-paying jobs in the future, and recognizing also that girls and women have an equally important role to play in these arenas as men and boys; 15. Calls upon States, with the support, where appropriate, of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, to develop policies and programmes, giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education programmes, including scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality and women’s empowerment, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to, inter alia, enable them to protect themselves from HIV infection and other risks; 16.
