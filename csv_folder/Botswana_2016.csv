States to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, Noting with deep concern that the global HIV epidemic disproportionately affects women and girls, and acknowledging the progress achieved in the realization of Goal 6 of the Millennium Development Goals as regards halting and reversing the spread of HIV, where the global response to HIV has averted millions of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths since 2000, when the Goals were set, Recognizing the need to intensify efforts to end the AIDS epidemic through fast-tracking the HIV response across the prevention and treatment continuum, including in the context of the “90-90-90” targets of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, and acknowledging the specific vulnerabilities of adolescent and young girls and women due to, inter alia, unequal power relations in society between women and men and boys and girls, Acknowledging that prevention, treatment, care and support for people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response that must be integrated into a comprehensive multisectoral gender-responsive approach to end the AIDS epidemic, Noting with concern that regulations, policies and practices, including those that limit the legitimate trade of generic medicines, may seriously limit access to affordable HIV treatment and other pharmaceutical products in low- and middle- income countries, recognizing that improvements can be made through, inter alia, national legislation, regulatory policy and supply chain management, and noting that reductions in barriers to affordable products could be explored in order to expand access to affordable and good-quality HIV prevention products, diagnostics, medicine and treatment commodities for HIV, including for opportunistic infections and co-infections, Stressing that gender equality and the civil, political, economic, social and cultural empowerment of women and girls, as well as the enjoyment of their full and equal human rights and fundamental freedoms, are fundamental in the eradication of poverty and the achievement of sustainable development, Stressing also that the lack of respect, protection, promotion and fulfilment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and insufficient access to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in accordance with the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, aggravates the impact of the AIDS epidemic, especially among women and girls, increasing their vulnerability and endangering the survival of present and future generations, Recognizing that children and adolescents are more likely to be lost to care, that children and adolescents on antiretroviral medication are less likely than adults to reach viral load suppression and that there are many challenges in diagnosing and treating infants, children and adolescents, Stressing the value and importance of social protection for the most vulnerable, and of achieving universal health coverage that comprises universal and equitable access to quality health services and ensures affordable and quality service 2/7 delivery to people living with HIV, including women and children, and making sure that universal health coverage also promotes HIV/AIDS responses, Recognizing that over 13.3 million children have lost one or both parents to HIV and AIDS, that those children have complex needs pertaining to protection, care and support and that they may be at increased risk of infection, as well as at increased risk of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, Noting with appreciation the efforts of Member States and the United Nations system to end all forms of violence against women and children, in particular the girl child, including the Secretary-General’s campaign “UNiTE to End Violence against Women” and the “HeForShe” campaign, Deeply concerned that all forms of violence against women and girls, discrimination and harmful practices are key contributing factors to the spread of HIV among women and girls, Deeply concerned also by the increased vulnerability to HIV infection faced by women and girls living with disabilities resulting from, inter alia, legal and economic inequalities, sexual and gender-based violence, discrimination and violations of their rights, Noting with concern that populations destabilized by armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters, internally displaced persons and refugees, in particular women and children, especially girls, are at increased risk of HIV infection, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects the enjoyment of their human rights, including the right to health, Recognizing also that access to quality education and information and the retention of girls in school are a critical element in the prevention of HIV infection among women and girls, Acknowledging the leadership of Governments, in

Calls upon all Governments to enact and intensify the implementation of laws, policies and strategies to eliminate all forms of gender-based violence and discrimination against women and girls in the public and private spheres and harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation and trafficking in persons, and ensure the full engagement of men and boys in order to reduce women and girls’ vulnerability to HIV; 4. Also calls upon all Governments to intensify efforts to reduce the particularly high levels of HIV infection among women and girls at higher risk by reducing barriers to their participation in HIV prevention and care where possible, as well as removing barriers to their full participation in society, and by addressing practices such as trafficking in persons that contribute to HIV risk and social marginalization of women and girls; 5. Further calls upon all Governments to ensure a just and equitable world for women and girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; 6.

Calls upon Governments and stakeholders to uphold commitments to eliminate mother-to-child transmission and keep mothers alive, including through integrating HIV prevention, treatment, care and support, including confidential voluntary counselling and testing and elimination of mother-to-child/vertical transmission, with other primary health-care services, especially sexual and reproductive health-care services, and through means to prevent new infections among women and adolescent girls of reproductive age and the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services and lifelong antiretroviral medication for women and girls living with HIV; 14.
