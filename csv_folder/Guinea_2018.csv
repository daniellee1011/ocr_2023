Sanchez Valle, that the original and ultimate source of governmental power in Puerto Rico lies in the United States Congress, and that any limited concession of 14/145 A/T3/23 self-government to Puerto Rico may be unilaterally revoked by the United States Congress, Stressing again the urgent need for the United States to lay the groundwork for the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto Rico, Noting the declarations by the Heads of State and Government of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Council of the Socialist International, which reiterate the inalienable rights of the people of Puerto Rico in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and which also reiterate the Latin American and Caribbean character of Puerto Rico and their support for the resolutions on Puerto Rico adopted by the Special Committee, Noting also the debate in Puerto Rico on the search for a procedure that would enable the process of decolonization of Puerto Rico to begin, and aware of the principle that any initiative seeking a solution to the political status of Puerto Rico should originate from the people of Puerto Rico, and of the fact that, to date, several laws in favour of convening a constitutional assembly on status have been presented in Puerto Rico, Further noting the concern of the people of Puerto Rico regarding violent actions, including repression and intimidation, against supporters of Puerto Rican independence, that have come to light through documents declassified by federal agencies of the United States, Aware that Vieques Island (Puerto Rico) was used for over 60 years by the United States Marine Corps and naval forces to carry out military exercises, with negative consequences for the health of the population, the environment and the economic and social development of that Puerto Rican municipality, Noting the consensus among the people and the Government of Puerto Rico on the need to clean up, decontaminate and return to the people of Puerto Rico of all the lands previously used for military exercises and installations, and use them for the social and economic development of Puerto Rico, as well as on the slowness of the process thus far, Also noting the constant complaints made by the inhabitants of Vieques Island regarding the continued bombing and the use of open burning as a clean-up method, thereby exacerbating the existing health and pollution problems and endangering civilian lives, Further noting that in the final document of the XVII Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries, held in Margarita Island (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), from 17 to 18 September 2016, and other meetings of the Non-Aligned Movement, the right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence is reaffirmed under General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), the Government of the United States is urged to assume its responsibility to expedite a process that will allow the Puerto Rican people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence and to return the territory and occupied installations on Vieques Island and at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station to the Puerto Rican people, who constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation, and the General Assembly is urged to actively consider the question of Puerto Rico in all its aspects, Having heard statements and accounts representative of various viewpoints among the people of Puerto Rico and their social institutions, 15/145 A/T3/23 Having considered the report of the Rapporteur of the Special Committee on the implementation of the resolutions concerning Puerto Rico, ! 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self- determination and independence in conformity with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the applicability of the fundamental principles of that resolution to the question of Puerto Rico, and that the people of Puerto Rico constitutes a Latin American and Caribbean nation that has its own distinct national identity; 2. Calls again upon the Government of the United States of America to assume its responsibility to expedite a process that will enable the Puerto Rican people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, in accordance and in full compliance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto Rico, and to take decisions, in a sovereign manner, to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty, and the problems related to education and health, which have been aggravated by the ravages of Hurricanes Irma and Maria; 3. Notes with concern that, by virtue of the decision of the United States Congress, under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) which creates the Financial Oversight and Management Board, the already weakened area in which the prevailing regime of political and economic subordination in Puerto Rico operates is reduced any further; 4. Notes the broad support of eminent persons, governments and political forces in Latin America and the Caribbean for the independence of Puerto Rico; 5. Again notes the debate in Puerto Rico on the implementation of a mechanism that would ensure the full participation of representatives of all sectors of Puerto Rican public opinion, including a constitutional assembly on status with a basis in the decolonization alternatives recognized in international law, and aware of the principle that any initiative seeking a solution to the political status of Puerto Rico should originate from the people of Puerto Rico; 6. Expresses serious concern over the actions carried out against supporters of Puerto Rican independence, and encourages the investigation of those actions with the necessary rigor and with the cooperation of the relevant authorities; 7. Requests the General Assembly to consider the question of Puerto Rico comprehensively and in all its aspects, and to decide on this issue as soon as possible; 8. Urges the Government of the United States, in line with the need to guarantee the legitimate right of the Puerto Rican people to self-determination and the protection of their human rights, to complete the return of all lands occupied by its military forces in Puerto Rico territory, in particular installations on Vieques Island and in Ceiba, to the people of Puerto Rico, respect fundamental human rights, such as the right to health and economic development, and expedite and cover the costs of the process of cleaning up and decontaminating the areas previously used in military exercises through means that do not continue to worsen the serious consequences of its military activity in order to protect the health of the inhabitants of Vieques Island and the environment; 9. Notes with satisfaction the report prepared by the Rapporteur of the Special Committee, in compliance with its resolution of 19 June 2017;! ' A/AC.109/2018/L.13. 16/145 A/T3/23 10. Requests the Rapporteur to report in 2018 on the implementation of the present resolution; including new developments relevant to a process of decolonization of Puerto Rico, in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV); 11. Decides to keep the question of Puerto Rico under continuous review. F. Consideration of other matters 32. Atits Ist meeting, on 22 February, the Special Committee adopted suggestions relating to the organization of its work put forward by the Chair and decided to include on its programme of work and timetable for 2018 items relating to the compliance of Member States with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and other resolutions on _ decolonization (see A/AC.109/2018/L.2). Question of holding a series of meetings away from Headquarters 33. Having regard to its programme of work for 2018, the Special Committee remained committed to its mandate to hold meetings away from Headquarters, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI) and paragraph 3 (9) of resolution 2621 (XXV), by which the Assembly authorized the Committee to meet elsewhere than at Headquarters whenever and wherever such meetings might be required for the effective discharge of its functions. Pattern of conferences 34. Inaccordance with measures that it had taken previously, the Special Committee continued to ensure the effective utilization of the conference-servicing resources allocated to it, and the further reduction of its documentation requirements by circulating communications and information material by, as much as possible, electronic means. A list of the documents of the Committee in 2018 is contained in annex I to the present report. 35. In the conduct of all its meetings during 2018, the Special Committee closely followed the guidelines set forth in the resolutions of the General Assembly on the pattern of conferences, in particular resolution 67/237.

(m) Recommended that the Special Committee should forge a close working relationship with non-governmental organizations concerned with decolonization, primarily in the Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a first step in that direction, it might request the Decolonization Unit of the Department of Political Affairs of the Secretariat to compile a list of such organizations with expertise in that area, using as the basis for such an exercise the current list of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (E/2016/INF/S5) and, in vetting other non-governmental organizations that did not yet have such status, being mindful of the need to ensure that non-governmental organizations chosen as partners would abide by the ideals of the United Nations and not engage in activities against certain Member States; (n) Affirmed the understanding that all those proposed activities would be adequately covered in the United Nations media and receive global exposure through the network of United Nations information centres; (o) On the issue of education, suggested that the relevant territorial Governments and the administering Powers should consider incorporating decolonization issues into the school curricula of the Non-Self-Governing Territories; (p) On the status-related and/or constitutional review exercises and the overall process of decolonization, stressed that such processes should be approached on a case-by-case basis and in a way that was respectful of human rights, transparent, accountable, inclusive and participatory, with the involvement of the people concerned, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions on decolonization and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations;

(w) On the role of the United Nations system in providing assistance to the Non-Self-Governing Territories, stressed that the relevant United Nations bodies and specialized agencies needed to fully engage with the work of the Special Committee and strengthen their efforts, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and through the appropriate mechanisms, to provide assistance to the Territories, and in that regard a proposal was made that the Committee should request the Secretary-General, in his capacity as Chair of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, to encourage active interaction between international organizations established in the United Nations system and the Committee, and underlined the fact that the Committee needed to develop ways and means to encourage the participation of those agencies and bodies, including improving communication and promoting their participation in the regional seminars to interact with the Committee and providing reports on the work in the Territories; (x) Advised the Special Committee that it needed to develop ways and means through which it could make a better assessment, on a case-by-case basis, of the current stage of decolonization and self-determination in each Non-Self-Governing Territory in accordance with the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United 139/145 A/T3/23 Nations, which could serve as a checklist of the progress made and things to be done and in that connection invited the Committee to continue to develop a specific project proposal in this regard; (y) Reiterated that the Special Committee needed to continue working towards sending visiting missions to the Non-Self-Governing Territories, with the involvement of the relevant territorial Government and administering Power, on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with General Assembly resolution 72/111 and other relevant United Nations resolutions, and in that regard noted the interest expressed at the seminar in such visiting and special missions;

I thank the people and Government of Grenada for hosting a regional seminar for the third time, following similar gatherings in 1992 and 2007. This regional seminar is an opportunity to examine the situations in the remaining 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories from the political perspective and to consider socioeconomic, environmental and cultural challenges that are relevant for the completion of the respective decolonization processes. This year’s focus on the Sustainable Development Goals in the context of the Non-Self-Governing Territories is especially timely. The Sustainable Development Goals, set out in the 2030 Agenda, are a blueprint for a common future of peace and prosperity. For the 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories facing the challenges of climate change, access to health care, diversification of economies, conservation of marine resources and scarcity of drinking water, implementing the Agenda is of particular importance. The Special Committee, in fulfilling its decolonization mandate, can assist the Territories to take actions towards a more sustainable world. But the Special Committee cannot act alone. All parties should be involved in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and advancing the decolonization agenda. Decolonization is still incomplete. What we need today to accomplish this monumental task is political will, creative thinking and action in partnership. Please accept my best wishes for productive discussions that contribute to this essential work. 144/145 A/73/23 Appendix III Resolution expressing appreciation to the Government and the people of Grenada The participants in the Pacific regional seminar, Having met in Saint George’s from 9 to 11 May 2018 to consider the challenges and opportunities in the process of decolonization in today’s world, Having heard an important statement at the opening of the seminar by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Labour, Taking note of the important statements by the representatives of the Non-Self- Governing Territories, Express their profound gratitude to the Government and the people of Grenada for providing the Special Committee with the facilities necessary for this seminar, for the outstanding contribution that they have made to the success of the seminar and, in particular, for the very generous and kind hospitality and the warm and cordial reception accorded to the participants throughout their stay in Grenada. 18-11348 it 180918 UU TELL 145/145",07/11/2018,2018_1642023,Guinea,19 June 2017 concerning Puerto Rico 21 February 2018 8 February 2018 8 March 2018 24 January 2018 6 March 2018 14 March 2018 28 December 2017 9 March 2018 22 February 2018 28 February 2018 24 January 2018 12 February 2018 14 February 2018 8 February 2018 14 February 2018 20 February 2018 19 January 2018 9 March 2018 9 April 2018 2 April 2018 19 December 2017 24 January 2018 6 March 2018 14 March 2018 28 December 2017 9 March 2018 22 February 2018 28 February 2018 24 January 2018 12 February 2018 14 February 2018 8 February 2018 14 February 2018 20 February 2018 19 January 2018 9 March 2018 9 April 2018 14 December 2017 1 June 2018 1 June 2018 1 June 2018 1 June 2018 1 June 2018 12 June 2018 12 June 2018 12 June 2018 13 June 2018 18 June 2018 18 June 2018 19 June 2018 12 February 20 19 June 2018 1 June 2018 12 June 2018 13 June 2018 18 June 2018 19 June 2018 12 February 2qis 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018 19 June 2018,yes

with persons with disabilities and the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and looking forward to the launch of the full report, Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Acknowledging with appreciation the decision of the Secretary-General to conduct an organizational review of the United Nations approach to mainstreaming disability across its operations and to use the outcome to inform the preparation of an internal policy and action plan to strengthen the ability to mainstream disabilities, in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, in particular women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they require specific protection and safety measures, and recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, Recognizing also the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Recognizing further that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities in development policies and 3/9 programmes, in particular in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the principle of leaving no one behind of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to consider disability as a global issue that cuts across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in public affairs and in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to

persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of guaranteeing accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and fundamental ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need to enhance capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, 4/9 Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics !’ and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by disability, gender and age, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, including but not limited to the Washington Group short set of questions on disability, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high - quality, accessible, timely and reliable data to measure progress in the implementation of the Goals for persons with disabilities, 1.

importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations ° See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document WSFS 2009/2. 2/11 contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, as well as in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and that these problems are increasing dramatically in some regions in the absence of urgent, determined and concerted action, Recognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, the least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility of commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe food insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, prevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, Stressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon Member States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to take further steps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of affected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national strategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition, Reaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited under international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to food, Stressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and nutrition availability, 3/11 Stressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Concerned that the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are harming agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus contributing to food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to increase with future climate change, Expressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the enjoyment of the right to food, Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and nutrition security and the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security!° by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems,!! which were endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security at its forty-first session, held from 13 to 18 October 2014, Stressing the importance of the Second International Conference on Nutrition, hosted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, and of its outcome documents, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, Stressing also the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture and nutrition, Recognizing that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, Recognizing also the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and nutrition and the right to food for all, Noting the cultural values of dietary and eating habits in different cultures, and recognizing that food plays an important role in defining the identity of individuals and communities and is a cultural component that describes and gives value to a territory and its inhabitants, 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document CL 144/9 (C 2013/20), appendix D. ""| Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document C 2015/20, appendix D. 4/11 Recognizing the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, Recognizing also the role of the Committee on World Food Security as an inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for a broad range of committed stakeholders to work together in a coordinated manner and in support of country-led processes towards the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security and nutrition for all human beings, Acknowledging the contribution of parliamentarians nationally and regionally to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition and ultimately to the realization of the right to food, and in this regard recognizing the convening of the first Global Parliamentary Summit against Hunger and Malnutrition, held in Madrid on 29 and 30 October 2018, Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, and recalling the commitment therein to work together to promote sustained and inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental protection and thereby to benefit all, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 of 27 July 2012, Recalling also the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030” and its guiding principles, which, inter alia, recognize the importance of promoting regular disaster preparedness and response and recovery exercises, with a view to ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, including access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as appropriate to local needs, as well as of fostering collaboration across global and regional mechanisms and institutions for the implementation and coherence of instruments and tools relevant to disaster risk reduction, such as for climate change, biodiversity, sustainable development, poverty eradication, environment, agriculture, health, food and nutrition and others, as appropriate, Recalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016—2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, and stressing the opportunity the Decade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition, Acknowledging the work done by the High-level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the Secretary-General in his continuing efforts in this regard, including continued engagement with Member States and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, up to 45 per cent of the children who die every year before the age Resolution 69/283, annex II. 5/11 of 5 die from undernutrition and hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people in the world affected by undernourishment, or chronic food deprivation, increased from around 804 million in 2016 to nearly 821 million in 2017; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people in the world is unacceptably high, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries and the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2016, reaching an estimated 821 million in 2017; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity and malnutrition to continue to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 9. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; 10. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and promoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 6/11 11.

Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, including private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle water scarcity; 16. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation 3 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 and A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.

Also recalls the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held on 22 and 23 September 2014,!* and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; 23. Notes the need to further examine various concepts, such as “food sovereignty”, and their relation to food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 24. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all; 25.
