support the Agency’s capacity to uphold its mandate and to avert the serious humanitarian, political and security risks that would result from any interruption or suspension of its vital work, Recognizing that the recurring and growing financial shortfalls directly affecting the sustainability of the Agency’s operations need to be remedied by examining new funding modalities designed to put the Agency on a stable financial footing to enable it to effectively carry out its core programmes in accordance with its mandate and commensurate with humanitarian needs, Welcoming the affirmation in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, adopted by the General Assembly on 19 September 2016,° that, inter alia, the Agency, along with other relevant organizations, requires sufficient
