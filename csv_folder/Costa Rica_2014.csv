capabilities, Recalling that the threat of violence, including all forms of harassment, is a permanent constraint on the mobility of women and girls, limits their access to resources, services and

girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between women and men, and that all forms of violence against women and girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability of women and girls to make use of their capabilities, Recalling that the threat of violence, including all forms of harassment, is a permanent constraint on the mobility of women and girls, limits their access to resources, services and basic activities, and impedes their economic and political empowerment, Emphasizing the need for States, and all segments of society, including civil society organizations, the private sector and media, as well as community leaders, including tribal leaders, and religious leaders to take meaningful steps to promote the empowerment of women and girls in order to achieve gender

reproductive health, and for the enjoyment of their human rights, and that respecting and promoting sexual and reproductive health, and protecting and fulfilling reproductive rights in accordance with

the Human Rights Committee on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption, Recognizing the need for further discussion and in-depth study of issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age and to procedural safeguards, effective oversight and remedies, with a view to further practical guidance, grounded in international human rights law, on the principles of necessity, proportionality and legitimacy, Noting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, “NETmundial”, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 23 and 24 April 2014, taking note of the outcome of that meeting, which reiterated, inter alia, the need for human rights to underpin Internet governance and that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, and recognizing that effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology will require an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Noting also that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communication technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against

one of the foundations of a democratic society, Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information and democratic participation, Concerned that other human rights, such as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to seek, receive and impart information, the right to

data, and highlighting the need to further consider the linkages between mass surveillance and its effects on other human rights, 6 A/69/397. 7 A/HRC/23/40 and Corr.1. 2/4 Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, including data about communications, known as metadata, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, especially when undertaken on a mass scale, Noting that while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory and that any interference with the right to privacy must be necessary and proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims and not impair the essence of the right, Noting that surveillance, the interception of digital communications and/or the collection of personal data that involves a State’s exercise of power or effective control over communications infrastructure, regardless of its location, may engage its human rights obligations relating to the right to privacy, Emphasizing that the human rights obligations of a State regarding the right to privacy extend to the exercise of its regulatory jurisdiction over private parties that physically control data, regardless of their location, Recalling that private enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights and to prevent and address the adverse impacts of their activities on human rights, as set out, notably, in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, ® Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, 1.
