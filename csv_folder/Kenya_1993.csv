Decides to consider the question of the implementation of the Programme of Action every two years in order to evaluate the progress made in eliminating the exploitation of child labour. ANNEX PROGRAMME OF ACTION FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE EXPLOITATION OF CHILD LABOUR General 1. In spite of the progress made in combating the exploitation of child labour, in particular through the development of national and international norms which have defined the bases of legal protection, and of mechanisms for monitoring their application, the exploitation of child labour still remains a current and widespread phenomenon of a serious nature in various parts of the world. 2. This phenomenon, which is both complex and worldwide, varies from one country to another. Although the industrialized countries are not spared, it affects the developing countries more particularly, and within each country the more vulnerable groups of the population. Poverty is often the main cause of child labour, but generations of children should not be condemned, until poverty is overcome, to exploitation. Underdevelopment cannot justify exploitation of which children are the victims. The Governments concerned and the international community as a whole must not wait for development problems to be adequately solved before attacking the phenomenon of the exploitation of child labour. Besides the long-term action which should be initiated with a view to treating the deep causes underlying the exploitation of child labour, it is essential that urgent measures and medium- and short-term action be taken to meet the immediate needs of the children who are exposed to the gravest dangers, while making sure that such action is integrated into economic and social development strategies. 3. High priority should be given to the elimination of the most odious or degrading forms of child exploitation, in particular child prostitution, pornography, the sale of children, the employment of children in dangerous occupations or for enforced begging and debt bondage. 4. The international community should place particular emphasis on the new phenomena of the exploitation of child labour, such as the use of children for illegal, clandestine or criminal purposes, including their implication in the narcotic drugs traffic or in armed conflicts or military activities. 5. Action should be directed, first, towards the most dangerous forms of child labour and the elimination of work by children under 10 years of age, with a view to the total elimination of child labour as prohibited by the provisions of the relevant international instruments. 6. Special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable categories of children: children of immigrants, street children, children of minority groups, indigenous children, refugee children, children in occupied territories and those under the apartheid regime. 7. In order to reach the core of one of the prime causes of exploitation of child labour, which is poverty, increased resources should be made available through bilateral and multilateral channels for the elimination of the exploitation of child labour. Elimination of the phenomena linked with the exploitation of child labour calls for social measures and development assistance. Their prevention will require deep structural reforms in the economic, social and cultural spheres. 8. Particular attention should also be given to social rehabilitation, education and information. It is important that the means of protecting children should be strengthened by development, the reinforcement of legislation and proper application of the relevant laws. 9. Adequate means and concerted measures are necessary at the local, national, regional and international levels. Information 10. The public could be made aware of the problem and the different aspects of the exploitation of child labour by national and international information campaigns. The extent of the problem cannot be accurately defined by reference to the statistics from various sources. The sectors favouring the exploitation of child labour should be specially targeted (agriculture, non- structured urban sector and domestic service). It is important to reach the children who are the invisible victims of parallel employment networks. At the national level it is necessary to develop means of investigation and supervision by labour inspectors in order to detect and prosecute cases of exploitation of child labour, so as to break up the clandestine employment networks. Public and private institutions and agencies dealing with children who have been victims of labour exploitation should be encouraged to keep appropriate statistical information for scientific purposes, while respecting anonymity and confidentiality. The information campaign should also be able to reach children directly, in order to inform them of their rights and make them aware of the risks they run. Education and vocational training 11. There is undoubtedly a link between child labour, illiteracy, school failure and the lack of vocational training. Education is one of the most effective measures to prevent child labour. Massive literacy programmes, combined with legislation making basic training obligatory and free, as well as measures to combat school wastage and to develop vocational training, in the form, for example, of a system of apprenticeship, are extremely necessary. Such programmes could be supported by community campaigns to increase the awareness and motivation of families, and in particular of women. Social action 12. The economic and social causes of the persistence of child labour, including the fact that it is seen in many cases as a means of survival for the children and their families, should be taken up in order to offer an alternative that will take the children out of the circle of poverty and exploitation. Urgent measures could be taken on behalf of children who are subjected to high physical and moral risks. It is important to give them protection and assistance, including social and medical assistance, while at the same time pursuing the objective of the elimination of child labour. These urgent measures should be backed up by programmes of social rehabilitation. Development aid 13. For many countries, the implementation of local, regional and national programmes on behalf of children requires appropriate international aid and a deeper commitment by the international community, whether through specific projects or through development assistance. Labour standards and their application 14. States should adhere to the international standards in force and ensure that they are rigorously applied. It is important that, in accordance with article 1 of International Labour Organisation Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), States should undertake ""to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and to raise progressively the minimum age for admission to employment or work to a level consistent with the fullest physical and mental development of young persons"". National legislation should explicitly prohibit dangerous or high-risk employment and prescribe penalties for employers who break this law, as well as providing for the establishment of an effective labour inspection system. In at least three cases the exploitation of child labour is no less than a flagrant crime which violates the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the most elementary principles of morality and all positive laws. Energetic repressive action is called for in these cases, namely: (a) Sale and similar practices (serfdom, bond service, fake adoption, abandonment) ; (b) Child prostitution, trafficking in pornography involving the sexuality of children, and international traffic in girls and boys for immoral purposes; (c) Under-age maidservants in a position of servitude. Duties of States 15. States should fully apply the provisions of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 1386 (XIV) of 20 November 1959 and, more particularly: (a) Principle 2, according to which ""The child shall enjoy special protection, and shall be given opportunities and facilities, by law and by other means, to enable him to develop physically, mentally, morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and normal manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity ...;"" (b) Principle 9, according to which ""The child shall be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation. He shall not be the subject of traffic, in any form ..."". 16. States should consider the possibility of ratifying, as soon as possible, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989, and in this context should fully implement, in particular, article 32, which reads as follows: ""1. States Parties recognize the rights of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. ""2. States Parties shall take legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to ensure the implementation of the present article. To this end, and having regard to the relevant provisions of other international instruments, States Parties shall in particular: (a) Provide for a minimum age or minimum ages for admission to employment; (b) Provide for appropriate regulation of the hours and conditions of employment; (c) Provide for appropriate penalties or other sanctions to ensure the effective enforcement of the present article."" 17. Over 40 countries have ratified International Labour Organisation Convention No. 138. Those that have not done so should take appropriate steps to ratify this Convention. In this connection, greater assistance from the International Labour Organisation should be extended to the developing countries to facilitate their increased participation in standard-setting activities and in the implementation of ratified conventions. 18. States should adopt and implement policies and programmes to narrow the gap between legislation and its implementation in practice. 19. States should, until such time that child labour is eliminated, pay specific attention to the issue of protection of working children and make recommendations on ways and means to ensure that their working conditions are kept under scrutiny and control. 20. States which have not already done so should review their legislation in the field of child labour with a view to the absolute prohibition of employment of children in the following cases: (a) Employment before the normal age of completion of primary schooling in the country concerned; (b) Under-age maid service; (c) Night work; (d) Work in dangerous or unhealthy conditions; (e) Activities linked with prostitution, pornography and other forms of sexual trade and exploitation; (f£) Work concerned with trafficking in and production of illicit drugs; (g) Work involving degrading or cruel treatment. 21. States should take preventive and curative measures, including the strengthening of their legislation, to combat the phenomena of the exploitation of child labour, such as the use of children for illegal, clandestine or criminal purposes, including the traffic in narcotic drugs, or in armed conflicts or military activities, or any other form of conflict. 22. Member States should be encouraged to strengthen cooperation between police and all public and private organizations which deal with cases of exploitation of child labour either within or outside the family, to facilitate identification of cases of exploitation of child labour and to take measures necessary to eliminate it. 23. States should, where necessary, undertake development programmes with a view to: (a) Making primary education compulsory and available free to all; (b) Assisting and encouraging families in order that their children may continue their education, in order to combat illiteracy and the phenomenon of school drop-outs; and, until such time that primary education is compulsory and available free to all, developing school programmes, including part-time education programmes, adapted to the needs of children who are not in school; (c) Adapting school curricula to the preparation of a child fora 21. career; (d) Improving the training programmes of professional workers dealing with child labour, in particular labour inspectors, social workers and magistrates, with a view, in particular, to making them more sensitive to the needs of children; (e) Establishing or improving medical services for children. 24. States should ensure the availability of a sufficient number of work inspectors and train them systematically to deal with cases of exploitation of child labour. Particular attention should be given to national and regional plans for economic and social development for the occupational training of young people. National development plans should also include a section devoted particularly to the employment of young people and to methods of ensuring that the most deprived have sufficient resources to be able to protect themselves from conditions leading to exploitation. 25. All Member States should endeavour to establish national agencies or institutions to promote the rights of children and to protect them from any form of exploitation. Particular efforts should be made to stress the importance of family values. Role of United Nations bodies and specialized agencies 26. The International Labour Organisation should be encouraged in its activities within the framework of its work programme relating to child labour. Other specialized agencies and United Nations bodies, in particular WHO, UNESCO and UNICEF, should develop and/or reinforce their activities in the field of child labour. 27. All competent United Nations agencies, development banks and intergovernmental bodies involved in development projects should ensure that no child is employed either directly or through local subcontractors. 28. The United Nations and the specialized agencies, having regard to their special responsibilities in the field of child labour, should pay special attention to the situation of children in South Africa and in the occupied Arab territories. 29. While the question of exploitation of child labour should primarily be dealt with by the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations human rights bodies should continue to be concerned with this question in the framework of the rights of the child in general. The Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and its Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery should continue to have responsibility in this field. 30. The United Nations and the specialized agencies, including the United Nations University, should continue to incorporate in their programmes a series of interdisciplinary and multinational projects for comparative research on the various aspects of the exploitation of child labour throughout the world and in particular in the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. 31. The United Nations and the specialized agencies should reinforce their programmes related to the elimination of the exploitation of child labour, and in particular to the study of the economic, social, legal and cultural factors which give rise to it. 32. The Secretary-General should invite all United Nations agencies and specialized agencies to attach greater importance to eliminating the exploitation of child labour and to study and discuss this issue at forthcoming international conferences, with special emphasis being placed on it at major conferences. 33. An international child welfare fund should be established. The resources of the fund would be allocated to combat violations of the rights provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly the rights of those children living in especially difficult circumstances, such as orphans and street children, refugees or displaced persons, victims of war and of natural and man-made disasters, including such perils as exposure to radiation and dangerous chemicals, children of migrant workers and other socially disadvantaged groups, child workers or youth trapped in the bondage of prostitution, sexual abuse and other forms of exploitation, disabled children and juvenile delinquents and victims of apartheid and foreign occupation. Such children deserve special attention, protection and assistance from their families and communities and as part of national efforts and international cooperation. Cooperation at the local, national and international levels 34. Major steps should be taken by Governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations to increase awareness amongst children, parents, workers, trade unions and employers of the causes and the adverse effects of child labour and measures to combat its exploitation. Such steps could include wider dissemination of relevant international instruments translated, where appropriate, into languages other than the official languages of the United Nations, as well as development and strengthening of existing norms. 35. Support should be given to non-governmental organizations concerned with the problem of child labour, particularly at the community level, and a constructive partnership should be evolved between Governments and non- governmental organizations. 36. The United Nations bodies and the specialized agencies dealing with the problem of child labour should seek the cooperation of national and international trade unions. 37. Appropriate and necessary forms of support should be given to non-governmental organizations at all levels, especially community organizations, concerned with the problem of child labour. 38. Concerned United Nations bodies and specialized agencies should examine the possibility of promoting an information campaign among villagers, employers, parents, children and other groups in countries where child labour exists. 39. Members of the international community should cooperate in order to assist developing countries in creating conditions under which child labour could be entirely eliminated. 37.",03/08/1993,1993_160531,Kenya,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council.",no

Decides to consider at its fiftieth session, as a matter of high priority, the programme of action for the third decade to combat racism and racial discrimination. ANNEX Activities recommended for inclusion in the programme of action for the third decade to combat racism and racial discrimination I 1. The Commission recommends the following programme elements proposed by the Secretary- General for the programme of action for the third decade to combat racism and racial discrimination (1993-2003), as contained in paragraphs 19-46 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/47/432): ""19, It is suggested that the goals and objectives of the third decade be those adopted by the Assembly for the first Decade and contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 3057 (XVIII): ""20. ""The ultimate goals of the Decade are to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind on grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, especially by eradicating racial prejudice, racism and racial discrimination; to arrest any expansion of racist policies, to eliminate the persistence of racist policies and to counteract the emergence of alliances based on mutual espousal of racism and racial discrimination; to resist any policy and practices which lead to the strengthening of the racist regimes and contribute to the sustainment of racism and racial discrimination; to identify, isolate and dispel the fallacious and mythical beliefs, policies and practices that contribute to racism and racial discrimination, and to put an end to racist regimes.' In drawing up suggested elements for the programme of action for the third decade, account has been taken of the fact that current global economic conditions have caused many Member States to call for budgetary restraint, which in turn requires a conservative approach to the number and type of programme for action which may be considered at this time. The Secretary-—General also took into account the relevant suggestions made by the Committee on the elimination of Racial Discrimination at its forty-first session. The elements presented below are suggested as those which are essential, should resources be made available to implement them. A. Action to combat apartheid ""21. Recently, there have been signs of change in South Africa, notably the abolition of such legal pillars of apartheid as the Group Areas Act, the Land Areas Act and the Population Registration Act. Although there is reason to be hopeful that South Africa is moving into the mainstream of the international community, the transition period may prove to be difficult and dangerous. Fierce political competition between political parties and ethnic groups has already led to bloodshed. ""22. Action will be needed to rectify the consequences of apartheid in South Africa. The policy of apartheid has entailed the use of State power to increase inequalities between racial groups. The knowledge and experience of human rights bodies dealing with racial discrimination could play a significant role in promoting equality. ""23. The General Assembly may wish to examine the best way to monitor apartheid in transition and initiate a mechanism to advise and assist the parties concerned to bring an end to this abhorrent regime not only in law but also in fact. Reference should be made to Security Council resolution 765 (1992) urging the South African authorities to bring an effective end to the violence and bring those responsible to justice. ""24. The Assembly may also wish to continue to examine the relevant work undertaken by the established United Nations bodies in the fight against apartheid, i.e. the Special Committee against Apartheid, the Group of Three and the Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on southern Africa. ""25. The Centre for Human Rights could offer technical assistance in the field of human rights to South Africa during and after the transition period. A cycle of seminars on apartheid could be envisaged, in cooperation with the specialized agencies and United Nations secretariat units concerned, which could include the following: ""(a) Seminar on apartheid and children, in cooperation with UNICEF; ""(b) Seminar on apartheid and the rights of workers, in cooperation with ILO; ""(c) Seminar on apartheid and public health, in cooperation with WHO; ""(d) Seminar on apartheid, education and culture, in cooperation with UNESCO; ""(e) Seminar on affirmative action for a non-racial society in South Africa. ""26. An inter-agency meeting could be convened immediately after the proclamation of the third decade, in 1994, to plan for the workshops and other activities. B. Action at the international level ""27. During the discussion in the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1992 on the Second Decade, many delegations expressed their concern with regard to new expressions of racism, racial discrimination, intolerance and xenophobia in various parts of the world. ""28. The manifestation of racist myths may be overt, as with the obvious example of apartheid, or they may be less evident as is the case with some employment, housing, immigration and asylum policies which tend to impact most negatively on people who are distinguishable ethnically or by nationality. There is a general awareness of the new expressions of racism and racial discrimination affecting minorities, ethnic groups, migrant workers, indigenous populations, gypsies, immigrants and refugees. ""29. The biggest contribution to the elimination of racial discrimination will be that which results from the actions of States within their own territories. International action undertaken as part of any programme for the third decade should therefore be directed so as to assist States to act effectively. The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination has established standards for States, and every opportunity should be seized to ensure that these are universally accepted and applied. ""30. The Assembly could consider more effective action to ensure that all States parties to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination fulfil their reporting and financial obligations. National action against racism and racial discrimination could be monitored and improved by requesting an expert member of the Committee to prepare a report on obstacles encountered with respect to the effective implementation of the Convention by States parties and suggestions for remedial measures. ""31. The Assembly may wish to propose the holding of regional workshops and seminars. A team from the Committee should be invited to monitor these meetings. The following themes are suggested for the seminars: ""(a) Seminar to assess the experience gained in the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The seminar would also assess the efficiency of national legislation and recourse procedures available to victims of racism; ""(b) Seminar on the eradication of incitement to racial hatred and discrimination, including the prohibition of propaganda activities and of organizations involved in them; ""(c) Seminar on the right to equal treatment before tribunals and by institutions, including the provision of reparation for damages suffered as a result of discrimination; ""(d) Seminar on the transmission of racial inequality from one generation to another, with special reference to the children of migrant workers and the appearance of new forms of segregation; ""(e) Seminar on international cooperation in the elimination of racial discrimination, including cooperation between States, the contribution of non-governmental organizations, national and regional institutions, United Nations bodies and petitions to treaty-monitoring bodies; ""(f) Seminar on the enactment of national legislation to combat racism and racial discrimination affecting ethnic groups, migrant workers and refugees (in Europe and North America); ""(g) Workshop on flows of refugees due to ethnic conflicts or political restructuring of multi-ethnic societies in socio-economic transition (Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia); ""(h) Training course on national legislation prohibiting racial discrimination for nationals from countries with and without such legislation; ""(i) Regional seminars on ethnicity, nation-building and human rights could also provide an opportunity for broadening knowledge of the causes of today's ethnic conflicts, and the participants could look for ways and means of solving them. ""32. The Assembly may wish to propose to the Department of Public Information of the United Nations Secretariat to undertake specific activities that could be carried out by Governments and relevant national non-governmental organizations to commemorate the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on 21 March each year. Support should be sought from artists as well as religious leaders, trade unions, enterprises and political parties to sensitize the population on the evils of racism and racial discrimination. ""33. In cooperation with UNESCO and the Department of Public Information, the Assembly could support the organization of a seminar on the role of mass media in combating or disseminating racist ideas. ""34. In cooperation with ILO, the possibility of organizing a seminar on the role of trade unions in combating racism and racial discrimination in employment could be explored. ""35. The General Assembly could consider requesting UNESCO to expedite the preparation of teaching materials and teaching aids to promote teaching, training and educational activities against racism and racial discrimination, with particular emphasis on activities at the primary and secondary levels of education. ""36. The Assembly may also wish to call upon Member States to make special efforts to: ""(a) Promote the aim of non-discrimination in all educational programmes and policies; ""(b) Give special attention to the civic education of teachers. It is essential that teachers be aware of the principles and essential content of the legal texts relevant to racism and racial discrimination and of how to deal with the problem of relations between children belonging to different communities; ""(c) Teach contemporary history at an early age, presenting children with an accurate picture of the crimes committed by fascist and other totalitarian regimes, and more particularly of the crimes of apartheid and genocide; ""(d) Ensure that curricula and textbooks reflect anti-racist principles and promote intercultural education. C. Action at the national and regional levels ""37. The following questions may be addressed in the context of action to be undertaken at the national and regional levels: Have there been any successful national models to eliminate racism and racial prejudices that could be recommended to States, e.g. for educating children, or principles of equality to tackle racism against migrant workers, ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, etc.? What kind of affirmative action programmes are there at the national or regional level to redress discrimination against specific groups? ""38. The General Assembly may wish to call upon States that have not yet done so to adopt, ratify and implement legislation prohibiting racism and racial discrimination, such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. ""39. The Assembly could call upon Member States to review their national programmes to combat racial discrimination and its effects in order to identify and to seize opportunities to close gaps between different groups and especially to undertake housing, educational and employment programmes that have proved to be successful in combating racial discrimination and xenophobia. ""40. The Assembly could recommend that Member States encourage the participation of journalists and human rights advocates from minority groups and communities in the mass media. Radio and television programmes should increase the number of broadcasts produced by and in cooperation with racial and cultural minority groups. Multicultural activities of the media should also be encouraged where they can contribute to the suppression of racism and xenophobia. ""41. The Assembly may wish to call upon regional organizations to cooperate closely with United Nations efforts in combating racism and racial discrimination. Intergovernmental organizations dealing with human rights issues could mobilize public opinion in their regions against the evils of racism and racial prejudices directed towards disadvantaged racial and ethnic groups. These institutions could serve an important function in assisting Governments to enact national legislation against racial discrimination and promote adoption and application of international conventions. Regional human rights commissions should be called upon to publicize widely basic texts on existing human rights instruments. D. Basic research and studies ""42. The long-term viability of the United Nations programme against racism and racial discrimination will depend in part on continuing research into the causes of racism and into the new manifestations of racism and racial discrimination. The Assembly may wish to examine the importance of preparing studies on racism. Following are some aspects to be studied: ""(a) Study of the application of article 2 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Such a study might assist States to learn from one another the national measures undertaken to implement the Convention; ""(b) Integration or preservation of cultural identity ina multiracial society; ""(c) Study of political rights, including the participation of various racial groups in political processes and their representation in government service; ""(d) Study of civil rights, including migration, nationality, freedom of opinion and association; ""(e) Study of educational measures to combat racial prejudice and discrimination and to propagate the principles of the United Nations; ""(f£) Global integration and the question of racism and the nation State; ""(g) National mechanisms against racism and racial discrimination in the fields of immigration, employment, salary, housing, education and ownership of property. E. Coordination and reporting ""43. It may be relevant to recall that in its resolution proclaiming the Second Decade the Assembly charged the Economic and Social Council with coordinating the implementation of the programme and evaluating the activities. The Assembly may wish to consider the following steps to strengthen the United Nations input into the third decade to combat racism and racial discrimination: ""(a) The General Assembly may wish to entrust the Economic and Social Council or the Commission on Human Rights, in cooperation with the Secretary-General, with the responsibility for coordinating the programmes and evaluating the activities undertaken in connection with the third decade; ""(b) The Secretary-General could be invited to provide specific information on activities against racism, to be contained in one annual report which would be comprehensive in nature and allow a general overview of all mandated activities. This would facilitate coordination and evaluation; ""(c) An open-ended working group of the Commission on Human Rights, or other appropriate arrangements under the Commission, may be established to review decade-related information, on the basis of annual reports referred to above, as well as relevant studies and reports of seminars, so as to assist the Commission in formulating appropriate recommendations to the Economic and Social Council on particular activities, allocation of priorities, etc. F. Regular system-wide consultations ""44, On an annual basis, consultations between the United Nations, specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations would take place to review and plan decade-related activities. In this framework, the Centre for Human Rights would organize inter-agency meetings to consider and discuss further measures to strengthen the coordination and cooperation of programmes related to the issues of combating racism and racial discrimination. ""45. The Centre for Human Rights would also strengthen the relationship with non-governmental organizations fighting against racism and racial discrimination by holding consultations and briefings with the non-governmental organizations. Such meetings could help them to initiate, develop and present proposals regarding the struggle against racism and racial discrimination. ""46. Should the Assembly approve the suggested elements of the programme for action for the third decade to combat racism and racial discrimination, the Secretary-General would include the activities to be carried out during the decade, as well as the related resource requirements in the proposed programme budgets, which will be submitted biennially, during the decade, starting with the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995."" It 2. The Commission recommends also that the themes proposed by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, as contained in paragraph 15 of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Second Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination (E/CN.4/1993/55), should be programmed: ""15. The Committee also considered the question of the launching of a third decade to combat racism and racial discrimination and, in that connection, examined an informal document containing a list of 10 topics relating to action to combat racism and racial discrimination prepared by one of its members. The Committee requested that the document should be transmitted to the Commission to serve as a basis for considering the programming of activities in a possible third decade. The following themes have been proposed: ""1. The eradication of incitement to racial hatred and discrimination, including the prohibition of propaganda activities and of organizations involved in it; ""2. The right to equal treatment before tribunals and by institutions, including the provision of reparation for damages suffered as a result of discrimination; ""3. Political rights, including the participation of various racial groups in political processes and their representation in government service; ""4, Civil rights, including migration, nationality, freedom of opinion and association; ""5. Economic rights, including work, trade union membership and housing; ""6. Social and cultural rights, including health and education; ""7, Educational measures to combat racial prejudice and discrimination and to propagate the principles of the United Nations; ""8. The protection of disadvantaged groups; this may include consideration of the position of indigenous peoples; ""9. The transmission of racial inequality from one generation to another, with special reference to the children of migrant workers and the appearance of new forms of segregation; ""10. International cooperation in the elimination of racial discrimination, including cooperation between States, the contribution of non-governmental organizations, national and regional institutions, United Nations bodies and petitions to treaty-monitoring bodies.""
