Expresses its great concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where such inequality and discrimination contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including by taking measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women and girls have equal access to social protection and resources, including income, land and water, and their ownership, and full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and to strengthen their role in decision-making; 8.

Convention on Climate Change, responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding an adverse impact on the latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty, Recognizing that poverty eradication is critical to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change resilience and the promotion and protection of human rights, including the rights of women and girls, who account for the majority of people living in poverty worldwide, Affirming that human rights obligations, standards and principles have the potential to inform and strengthen international, regional and national policymaking in the area of climate change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes, Emphasizing that the adverse effects of climate change have a range of implications, which can increase with greater global warming, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights, including, inter alia, the right to life, the right to adequate food, the right to the enjoyment of highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to adequate housing, the right to self-determination, the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, the right to work and the right to development, and recalling that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, Recognizing that climate change poses an existential threat for some countries, and recognizing also that climate change has already had an adverse impact on the full and effective enjoyment of human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments, Expressing concern that, while these implications affect individuals and communities around the world, the adverse effects of climate change are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations owing to A/HRC/38/L.5 factors such as geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status, national or social origin, birth or other status and disability, Recognizing that women and girls are disproportionately affected by the negative impact of climate change, and emphasizing that sudden-onset natural disasters and slow- onset events seriously affect their access to food and nutrition, safe drinking water and sanitation, health-care services and medicines, education and training, adequate housing and access to decent work, Recognizing also that women are not only victims but also agents of change, and that the integration of a gender-responsive approach into climate policies, including by conducting gender analysis, ensuring women’s right to participate, access to education and training and access to and control over adequate resources, such as clean energy and technology, would increase the effectiveness of climate change mitigation and adaptation, Noting that gender-responsive climate policies continue to require further strengthening in all activities concerning adaptation, mitigation and related means of implementation, such as finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity- building, Expressing concern that countries lacking the resources to implement their adaptation plans and programmes of action and effective adaptation strategies may suffer from higher exposure to extreme weather events, in both rural and urban areas, particularly in developing countries, including those in least developed countries and small island developing States, Taking into account the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with nationally defined development priorities, Recalling that the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change acknowledges that climate change is a common concern of humankind and that parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity, Urging States that have not already ratified the Paris Agreement and the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to do so, Emphasizing the importance of implementing the commitments undertaken under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on mitigation, adaptation and the provision of finance, technology transfer and capacity-building to developing countries, and emphasizing also that realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement would enhance the implementation of the Convention and would ensure the greatest possible adaptation and mitigation efforts in order to minimize the adverse impact of climate change on present and future generations, Welcoming the twenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Climate Change Conference, organized by Fiji and held in Bonn, Germany in November 2017 and April and

slow onset adverse effects of climate change and the necessary means of implementation of adaptation and mitigation plans of developing countries to bridge the protection gaps undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 35/20 of 22 June 2017,° Noting that the human rights obligations and responsibilities as enshrined in the relevant international human rights instruments provide roles for States and other duty bearers, including businesses, to promote, protect and respect, as would be appropriate, human rights, including those of women and girls, when taking action to address the adverse effects of climate change, Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment focusing on climate change and human rights,° Noting that the Special Rapporteur on the right to food asserted that climate change has a long-term and deeper impact on food insecurity, and recommended that increasing finance to support developing countries in tackling climate change impacts, through adaptation and by addressing loss and damage, is essential,’ Noting with appreciation the work of the Climate Vulnerable Forum which asserted that climate change is a major threat to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, Noting the importance of facilitating meaningful interaction between the human rights and climate change communities at both the national and international levels in order to build capacity to deliver responses to climate change that respect and promote human rights, taking into account the Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action and other similar efforts, Noting also the establishment and work of

availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which it proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, Recalling further the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at the 2014 high-level meeting of the Sanitation and Water for All partnership and in the Ngor Declaration on Sanitation and Hygiene, adopted at the fourth African Conference on Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2015, the Dhaka Declaration, adopted at the sixth South Asian Conference on Sanitation, in 2016, the Lima Declaration, adopted at the fourth Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Sanitation, in 2016, and the Dar es Salaam road map for achieving the Ngor commitments on water security and sanitation in Africa, adopted at the sixth Africa Water Week, in 2016, and noting the Budapest Water Summit 2016 and its recommendations, the call for action of the high-level symposium on the theme “Sustainable Development Goal 6 and targets: ensuring that no one is left behind in access to water and sanitation”, held in Dushanbe in 2016, the seventh South Asian Conference on Sanitation, held in Islamabad in 2018, and the High-level International Conference on the International Decade for Action “Water for Sustainable Development”, held in Dushanbe in 2018, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2017 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation in 2015, an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 844 million people lack a basic water service, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.5 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation and 892 million people still practise open defecation, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow- onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, A/HRC/39/L.11 Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres, and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions, and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes, or practising open defecation, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the respect, promotion and protection of all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Recalling that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to the right to life and human dignity, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds, and with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, income levels or other relevant considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation A/HRC/39/L.11 entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 2.

Stresses the important role of international cooperation and _ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons at risk have equal access to effective remedies; 6. Notes with concern that, in spite of all efforts, gender inequalities still exist in the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 7. Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law; (b) To ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for persons at risk and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds; (c) To monitor continuously and analyse regularly the status of the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation and to enhance efforts to improve the availability, accessibility, quality and use of water-related data at local, national and regional levels, and to develop disaggregated and gender-responsive indicators and monitoring mechanisms; (d) To promote both women’s leadership and their full, effective and equal participation in decision-making on water and sanitation management, ensure that a gender- based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes, including measures to reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education, to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when ' A/ARC/39/55.

the cooperation framework between the World Health Organization and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and that between the Office of the High Commissioner and the United Nations Population Fund, and also of the articles on the protection of persons in the event of disasters, adopted by the International Law Commission,” Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies, entities providing humanitarian assistance and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and their review conferences and outcome documents, in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that international humanitarian law and international human rights law are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and recognizing that persons affected by disasters are entitled to the respect for and protection of their human rights in accordance with international law, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, including in humanitarian settings, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, accountability, participation, transparency, empowerment, _ sustainability, non- discrimination and international cooperation, Stressing that reducing maternal mortality and morbidity with full respect of States’ human rights obligations and commitments will require integrated efforts across the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third ' Leading the Realization of Human Rights to Health and through Health, report of the High-level Working Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children and Adolescents (Geneva, World Health Organization, 2017). A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 International Conference on Financing for Development and in the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Recognizing that respect for and the protection and fulfilment of the full enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls and the full implementation of all Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda, including Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls and target 3.1 on reducing global maternal mortality, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, and particularly in humanitarian settings, and that a dramatic and sustainable scaling up of quality treatment and health-care services, including high-quality emergency obstetric services and also of the number of trained, competent fistula surgeons and midwives, is needed to significantly reduce maternal and new-born mortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, Recognizing also that humanitarian settings may exacerbate pre-existing patterns and structures of discrimination and inequalities and further undermine access to health care, information and services, housing, water, sanitation, education and employment for women and girls, and that in affected areas access to essential services, such as health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, are disrupted owing to inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional health-care workers, basic medicines and health-care supplies and survivor-centred referral pathways for all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further that, in humanitarian settings, disintegrating judicial systems, gender-based discrimination and discrimination against refugees in host countries, fear of reprisals against their families or themselves, and the stigma associated with sexual and gender-based violence all prevent women and girl survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and those denied access to sexual and reproductive health-care services from reporting sexual violence and seeking justice, accountability and remedies for the violations they have endured, Deeply concerned that women and girls living in humanitarian settings are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of violation of their rights, including through trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, and lack of accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, and lack of access to water and sanitation, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates between countries, but also within countries, and between women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, which creates the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Deeply concerned that in countries affected by humanitarian situations, the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54 compared to | in 180 globally, and that the majority of preventable maternal deaths have occurred in settings of armed conflict, natural disasters and displacement, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, both globally and in humanitarian settings, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Recognizing the need for further disaggregated data on maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and for access to sexual and reproductive health-care services in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, and recognizing the need to bridge the humanitarian- development divide, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and their review conference and outcome documents, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, good practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy and guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion in accordance with international human rights law and where not against national law, the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2.

Encourages Governments, local authorities, the United Nations system and regional organizations, and invites donors and other assisting countries, to address the vulnerabilities and capacities of women and girls through gender-responsive programming, including with regard to sexual and reproductive health needs and the means to address sexual and gender-based violence and various forms of exploitation during emergencies and in post-disaster environments, and the allocation of resources in their disaster risk reduction, response and recovery efforts in coordination with the Governments of affected countries; 6. Strongly urges States and all parties to armed conflict to take effective measures to prevent and address acts of violence, attacks and threats against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities in armed conflict, including through the development of domestic legal frameworks to ensure respect for their relevant international legal obligations; 7. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,* and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 8. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, including by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data, and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 9. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect women’s bodily autonomy and privacy and the equal right to decide autonomously in matters regarding their own lives and health by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights law and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviours that are discriminatory; 10. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 aimed at preventing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, including those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, including in humanitarian settings, such as by informing women of their rights under relevant international and domestic law, and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 11. Further urges States to ensure accountability and gender-sensitive, prompt and effective remedies for the violation of the rights of women and girls in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings by including transparent forms of monitoring, review and oversight of humanitarian programmes and policies, including the monitoring of inequities; 12. Calls upon States to support gender equality and women’s rights and the rights of the child, including within families, through awareness-raising initiatives, including in schools and in displaced and refugee camps and settlements, especially education and public awareness-raising, including through the media and online, the incorporation of curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, and ensuring universal access to evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child; 13. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a comprehensive human rights-based approach to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of accessible, affordable and appropriate health-care services for all, and of information and education, lack of access to medicine and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, especially adolescent girls, and to ensure access to accountability for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, including effective reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence, such as the prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence committed in humanitarian settings, while ensuring the meaningful and effective participation of women and girls in the relevant processes; 14.

Calls upon States to ensure a more holistic and coordinated approach to the humanitarian-development nexus, and places the individual woman and girl at the centre of humanitarian preparedness and response, and recognizes the need to overcome siloed approaches and fragmented programming; 16. Also calls upon States to ensure the effective and meaningful participation of women and girls, including through civil society and feminist networks and women’s rights organizations, in identifying and determining needs, priorities for funding and service, processes for access and delivery, and crisis response, in recognition of their agency; 17. Urges States to strengthen their statistical capacity and to promote reliable transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls in affected populations, including host populations; A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 18. Invites States to consider the systematic integration of sexual and reproductive health as an integral part of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health into the mandates of investigative bodies established by the Human Rights Council, including commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, and to address human rights violations suffered by women in humanitarian settings; 19.

surgeons and midwives, is needed to significantly reduce maternal and new-born mortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, Recognizing also that humanitarian settings may exacerbate pre-existing patterns and structures of discrimination and inequalities and further undermine access to health care, information and services, housing, water, sanitation, education and employment for women and girls, and that in affected areas access to essential services, such as health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, are disrupted owing to inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional health-care workers, basic medicines and health-care supplies and survivor-centred referral pathways for all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further that, in humanitarian settings, disintegrating judicial systems, discrimination on the basis of gender and against refugee populations in host countries, fear of reprisals against their families or themselves, and the stigma associated with sexual and gender-based violence all prevent women and girl survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and those denied access to sexual and reproductive health-care services from reporting sexual violence and seeking justice, accountability and remedies for the violations they have endured, Deeply concerned that women and girls living in humanitarian settings are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of violation of their rights, including through trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, and lack of accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, and lack of access to water and sanitation, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, A/HRC/39/L.13 Reaffirming that the human rights of women and girls include their right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for their dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates between countries, but also within countries, and between women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, which creates the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Deeply concerned that in countries designated as fragile States, the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54 compared to 1 in 180 globally, and that the majority of preventable maternal deaths have occurred in settings of conflict, natural disasters and displacement, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, both globally and in humanitarian settings, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Recognizing the need for further disaggregated data on maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and for access to sexual and reproductive health-care services in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, and recognizing the need to bridge the humanitarian- development divide, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and their review conference and outcome documents, and the right of everyone to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, good practices and legal frameworks that respect the right to bodily autonomy and guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health, services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion in accordance with international human rights law and standards and where not against national law, the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2. Urges States, in accordance with obligations under relevant provisions of international human rights law, including the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the right to sexual and reproductive health, to ensure the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care services, including mental health care and psychosocial services and sexual and reproductive health- care services, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; A/HRC/39/L.13 3. Calls upon States to pay special attention to the particular situation of adolescent girls in humanitarian settings, who may have to assume adult responsibilities and are exposed to higher risks of sexual and gender-based violence, child, early and forced marriage and trafficking, and are likely to be denied education, skills training, safe employment opportunities and access to sexual and reproductive health-care services and information, and to face isolation, discrimination and stigma, mental health issues and risk- taking behaviour; 4. Encourages all stakeholders to use the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s Guidelines for Integrating Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action, the its Gender Handbook and the Inter-agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings, and to ensure delivery of the Minimum Initial Service Package for Reproductive Health at the onset of humanitarian emergencies, with particular attention to women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and in situations of vulnerability, and to ensure a transition, as soon as possible, towards comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services, information and education; 5. Encourages Governments, local authorities, the United Nations system and regional organizations, and invites donors and other assisting countries, to address the vulnerabilities and capacities of women and girls through gender-responsive programming, including with regard to sexual and reproductive health needs and the means to address sexual and gender-based violence and various forms of exploitation during emergencies and in post-disaster environments, and the allocation of resources in their disaster risk reduction, response and recovery efforts in coordination with the Governments of affected countries; 6. Strongly urges States and all parties to armed conflict to take effective measures to prevent and address acts of violence, attacks and threats against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities in armed conflict, including through the development of domestic legal frameworks to ensure respect for their relevant international legal obligations; 7. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,* and encourages States and stakeholders to consider the adoption of the recommendations contained therein; 8. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, including by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data, and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 9. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect women’s and girls’ right to bodily autonomy and privacy by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights standards and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third- party authorization for health information and services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviours that are discriminatory; 10. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing violations of the right to sexual and reproductive health, including A/HRC/39/L.13 those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, including in humanitarian settings, such as by informing women and girls of their rights under relevant international and domestic law, and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 11. Further urges States to ensure accountability and gender-sensitive, prompt and effective remedies for the violation of the rights of women and girls in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings by including transparent forms of monitoring, review and oversight of humanitarian programmes and policies, including the monitoring of inequities; 12. Calls upon States to support gender equality and women’s and girls’ rights, including within families, through awareness-raising initiatives, including in schools and in displaced and refugee camps and settlements, especially education and public awareness- raising, including through the media and online, the incorporation of curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, and ensuring universal access to evidence- based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child; 13. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a comprehensive human rights-based approach to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of accessible, affordable and appropriate health-care services for all, and of information and education, lack of access to medicine, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, especially adolescent girls, and to ensure access to accountability for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, including effective reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence, such as the prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence committed in humanitarian settings, while ensuring the meaningful and effective participation of women and girls in the relevant processes; 14. Calls upon all relevant actors, including Governments, regional organizations, relevant United Nations agencies, national human rights institutions, entities providing humanitarian assistance and civil society organizations to, within their respective mandates, strengthen their efforts to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings when designing, implementing and reviewing policies and evaluating programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, while ensuring the meaningful participation of women and girls in all decisions that affect them; 15. Calls upon States to ensure a more holistic and coordinated approach to the humanitarian-development nexus, and places the individual woman and girl at the centre of humanitarian preparedness and response, and recognizes the need to overcome siloed approaches and fragmented programming; 16. Also calls upon States to ensure the effective and meaningful participation of women and girls, including through civil society and feminist networks and women’s rights organizations, in identifying and determining needs, priorities for funding and service, processes for access and delivery, and crisis response, in recognition of their agency; 17. Urges States to strengthen their statistical capacity and to promote reliable transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls in affected populations, including host populations; 18. Invites States to consider the systematic integration of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights into the mandates of investigative bodies established by the Human Rights Council, including commissions of inquiry and fact- finding missions, and to promote an integrated agenda that recognizes and is responsive to the continuum of human rights violations suffered by women and girls in crisis settings and A/HRC/39/L.13 their consequences, including the displacement of populations and living conditions in humanitarian contexts and settings; 19. Requests the High Commissioner to prepare, from within existing resources, in consultation with States, United Nations agencies and all other relevant stakeholders, a follow-up report on good practices and challenges in the application of a human rights- based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the utilization of the technical guidance by States and other relevant actors, including the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and the World Health Organization, and to present it to the Human Rights Council at its forty-fifth session; 20.
