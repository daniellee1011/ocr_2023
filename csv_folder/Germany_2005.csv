extreme poverty,"The Commission on Human Rights, Recalling that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights recognize that the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want can be achieved only if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his or her economic, social and cultural rights, as well as his or her civil and political rights, Recalling in particular that article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his or her family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his/her control, Recalling also that the eradication of widespread poverty, including its most persistent forms, and the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights remain interrelated goals, Reaffirming that the promotion of all human rights, including the right to development, and the elimination of extreme poverty can contribute substantially to the promotion and consolidation of democracy, Deeply concerned that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and manifestations, such as hunger, trafficking in human beings, disease, lack of adequate shelter, illiteracy and hopelessness, are particularly severe in developing countries, though acknowledging the significant progress made in several parts of the world in combating extreme poverty, Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, Recalling in particular that the World Conference reaffirmed that least developed countries committed to the process of democratization and economic reforms, many of which are in Africa, should be supported by the international community in order to succeed in their transition to democracy and economic development, Reaffirming that the fight against extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community and bearing in mind in this regard the commitments made in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development held in March 1995, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in September 2002, as well as the Declaration on the tenth anniversary of the World Summit for Social Development, adopted in February 2005, Bearing in mind the commitments reaffirmed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, particularly to spare no effort to fight against extreme poverty, including the commitment to halve by 2015 the proportion of the world’s people whose income is less than one United States dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, and looking forward to the five-year review of the Declaration to be held in September 2005, Recalling General Assembly resolution 50/107 of 20 December 1995, in which the Assembly proclaimed the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006),

resolution 59/186 of 20 December 2004, and the importance they attach to giving men and women living in extreme poverty the wherewithal to organize and participate in all aspects of political, economic and social life, Recalling the determination of States to eradicate the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women, which was reaffirmed during the forty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of Women (E/CN.6/2005/L.1), Recalling also its resolution 2003/22 of 22 April 2003 on women’s equal ownership of, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing, which recognizes that restrictions on women’s equal access to credit and loans, factors preventing them from owning and inheriting land may contribute to the feminization of poverty, Stressing the necessity of better understanding the causes and consequences of extreme poverty, Stressing also that respect for all human rights, which are indivisible and interdependent, is crucial to the fight against extreme poverty, Noting that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has chosen the eradication of poverty as a cross-cutting theme of its strategy for 2002-2007, Reaffirms that: (a) Extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent national and international

prevail, national action and international action and cooperation are required for the promotion of a better life for all in larger freedom, a critical element of which is the eradication of poverty; 1)) Political commitment, social justice and equal access to social services are conditions sine qua non for the eradication of poverty, and welcomes in this connection the fact that States and international organizations have never been so aware of the urgency of winning the battle against extreme poverty; (2) It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the societies in which they live and in the realization of human rights, and for people living in poverty and vulnerable groups to be empowered to help plan, implement and evaluate policies that affect them, thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development; (h) Special attention must be given to the plight of women, particularly older women and women head of

enabling environment for investment are the basis for sustainable development; (c) That to ensure the protection of the rights of all individuals, non-discrimination with regard to the poorest and the full exercise of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, a better understanding is needed of what is endured by people living in poverty, including women and children, and that thought must be given to the subject, drawing on the experience and ideas communicated by the poorest themselves and by those committed to working alongside them; 3.

Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the declarations and programmes of actions of and follow-up processes to the United Nations world conferences summits held in Vienna,3 Cairo,4 Copenhagen,5 Istanbul,6 Durban’ and J ohannesburg,8 Reaffirming the Declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth session as a follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and to the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, which emphasizes that the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is essential to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and stresses the need to ensure the integration of a gender perspective in the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the review of the Millennium Declaration, Recalling its resolution 2004/21 of 16 April 2004 on adequate housing as a component on the right to an adequate standard of living, and resolution 2003/22 of 22 April 2003 on women’s equal ownership, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that women’s equal ownership, access to and control over land and the equal right to own property and to adequate housing contribute to the full realization of human rights, Recognizing that women, particularly women living in extreme poverty and victims of domestic violence, continue to suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, inter alia on the grounds of property, as well as from discriminatory treatment in all areas decisive to the attainment of adequate housing, Reaffirming the human right to be free from all forms of discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, Mindful of the fact that elimination of discrimination against women and the achievement of substantive equality of women and girls require consideration of women’s specific socio-economic context, Welcoming the findings of the former Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences (see E/CN.4/2000/68/Add.5), in particular, the recognition that women’s poverty, together with a lack of alternative housing options, make it difficult for women to leave violent family situations, and reaffirming that forced relocation and forced eviction from home and land have a disproportionately severe impact on women, including when these are committed by spouses or in-laws, and encouraging the new Special Rapporteur to continue to take these findings into consideration in her future work, Recognizing that poverty is a major obstacle to women’s full realization of housing, land and property rights, Convinced that the lack of adequate housing can make women more vulnerable to various forms of violence, including domestic violence, and in particular that the lack of housing alternatives may limit many women’s ability to leave violent situations, Stressing that the impact of gender-based discrimination and violence against women on women’s equal ownership of, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing is acute, particularly during complex emergency situations, reconstruction and rehabilitation, Recognizing that the Secretary-General has linked the growing prevalence of HIV/AIDS in women with laws that

which calls for all Governments to strengthen or enforce legislation, regulations and other measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by people living with HIV/AIDS and members of vulnerable groups, in particular, to ensure their access to inheritance and legal protections, Recognizing that laws, policies, customs, traditions and practices that act to restrict women’s equal access to credit and loans also prevent women from owning and inheriting land, property and housing and exclude women from participating fully in development processes, are discriminatory and contribute to increasing the poverty of women and girls, Convinced that international, regional and local trade, finance and investment policies should be designed in such a way that they promote gender equality in terms of ownership of, access to and control over land and the rights to own property and to adequate housing and other productive resources and do not undermine women’s capacity to acquire and retain these resources, Also convinced of the need to address specifically the impact of natural disasters on women’s and children’s adequate housing needs and to ensure that a human rights approach, including a gender perspective, is taken when addressing this impact, 1.

Decides to incorporate the technical guidance on methodologies for adjustment under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol, contained below in the annex to this decision, into the",N/A,N/A,"2. Recommends that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, at its first session, adopt decision -/CMP.1 (Issues relating to adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) below, to replace decision -/CMP.1 (Technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 20/CP.9. "" FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.3. ANNEX Technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol I. Objective 1. The objective of this technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol' is: To provide for adjusted estimates that fully meet the requirements of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7;? (a) To ensure that adjustments are applied consistently,” comparably and transparently, taking into account the time frames provided in the guidelines for review under Article 8, and that, as far as possible, similar methods are used for similar problems across all inventories subject to adjustments under Article 8. (b) II. General approach 2. This technical guidance establishes general and specific procedures and methods for use by expert review teams to calculate adjustments. These procedures and methods are supplemented by inventory review resources listed in appendix I to this technical guidance, which will also facilitate consistency in calculation of adjustments by expert review teams. A. Procedures 3. The calculation and application of adjustments shall follow paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7. 4. Adjustments shall be applied, taking into account section II.B below, only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) including supplementary inventory data on Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC Guidelines) as elaborated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry* (hereinafter referred to collectively as the IPCC good practice guidance), and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). 5. Expert review teams shall, under their collective responsibility, calculate, document and recommend adjustments in accordance with the provisions for the review of annual inventories under ! All articles referred to in this technical guidance are those of the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol are hereinafter referred to as adjustments. ? In this context, consistency means that the application of adjustments should be consistent across Parties and by all expert review teams. Article 8 and this technical guidance. A compilation of the provisions relevant to the timing and reporting of adjustments from these guidelines is included in appendix II to this technical guidance. 6. The expert review team should collectively decide on the methodological approach for calculation of any adjustment, including relevant components of the adjustment method (such as data sources, drivers’ and clusters® used). 7. Expert review teams should apply the appropriate adjustment method, selected from table 1, in a simple manner, given the limited time available for the calculation of adjustments according to the provisions for the review of annual inventories in the guidelines for review under Article 8 (see paragraph 3 of appendix II). 8. Expert review teams should apply this technical guidance in a consistent and comparable manner and, as far as possible, use similar methods for similar problems across all inventories reviewed under Article 8, taking into account the provisions for obtaining conservative estimates, as described in paragraphs 51 and 52 below. 9. To enhance consistency in the application of adjustments for any given Party, the same adjustment method should be used, whenever possible, in cases where the same inventory problem was adjusted in an earlier year (e.g. for the base year or for an earlier year of the commitment period). This provision applies to both the basic adjustment method,” and the main components used in the calculation of the adjustment, as appropriate, such as the source of international data, drivers, clusters and any other inventory parameter used. 10. Any adjustments to estimates of emissions and removals for purposes of establishing the assigned amount under Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, will only be applied during the initial review under Article 8. 11. Adjustments should be applied only for individual inventory years, specifically the base year or the latest year of the commitment period under review, and not for an entire time series or group of years, except for cases described in paragraphs 12 and 13 (b)—(c) below. 12. Adjustments should not be retroactively applied for any year preceding the inventory year subject to review, except in cases where recalculated estimates for previous commitment period years and/or instances relating to paragraph 13 (c) below were submitted by the Party together with the inventory information of the inventory year subject to review. Where the Party submits recalculated estimates for commitment period years prior to the inventory year subject to review, adjustments may be applied retroactively for those estimates that have not yet been reviewed, if the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. 13. For estimates of emissions and removals resulting from activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, adjustments may be applied to an individual year or for a group of years, as follows: For activities for which the Party has chosen to account annually, any adjustments should be applied during the annual review for the latest submitted inventory; (a) > For the purpose of this technical guidance, driver refers to indicative data other than activity data or other inventory parameters used in the calculation of emission or removal estimates, that are correlated with emissions or removals, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, associated production data, wells drilled, GDP per capita. The criteria for selecting drivers for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 40. ® For the purpose of this technical guidance, cluster refers to inventory-related data from a group of countries. The criteria for selecting clusters for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 39. 7 For the purpose of this technical guidance, basic adjustment methods are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section I11.D below. For activities for which the Party has chosen to account for the entire commitment period, any adjustments should be considered and applied for any individual year or for any group of years of the commitment period, as necessary, only during the annual review for the final year of the commitment period. Adjustments shall not be considered or applied during any annual review prior to that for the final year of the commitment period; (b) For cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation under Article 3, paragraph 4, any adjustment to the emissions or removals in the base year resulting from these activities should be considered and applied according to the choice made by a Party regarding the periodicity of accounting of these activities (e.g. annually or at the end of the commitment period). In the case that the Party has chosen to account annually for these activities and submits recalculated estimates, adjustments may be applied retroactively for the base year, provided these recalculated estimates have not yet been subject to review and the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. (c) 14. The selection of data and other components required for an adjustment method should take into account the time series for any such component. 15. Even if some aspects of a particular case are not fully covered by this technical guidance, the experts calculating the adjustment shall adhere to paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) and, as closely as possible, to this technical guidance. B. Applicability of adjustments 16. In considering the need for an adjustment, expert review teams should adhere to standard inventory review approaches, which also include assessment of the time series for a given estimate. 17. If the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of emissions in the base year, or an overestimation of emissions in a year of the commitment period, the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied, if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate with a value for the base year that is higher than the original estimate submitted by the Party or a value for a year of the commitment period that is lower than the original estimate. 18. Similarly, if the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of removals resulting from any activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, in a year of the commitment period, or an overestimation of removals in the base year for any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4 (cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation), the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate that is less conservative than the original estimate submitted by the Party. 19. An adjustment procedure should be initiated if the information provided by the Party is not sufficiently transparent, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 4 above. 20. If the expert review team identifies a deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance that is caused by the allocation of estimates to a wrong category or activity under Article 3, paragraph 3 or 4, adjustments should not be applied in the following cases:* ¥ In these cases, reallocation is recommended to the Party as part of the review of annual inventories under Article 8. If reallocation to the correct source category does not affect total emissions from sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol (a) If the reallocation does not affect the accounting of emissions and/or removals from any individual activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4. (b) 21. If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. II1. Methods and conservativeness 22. In general, expert review teams shall calculate each adjustment at the level at which the problem is identified, e.g. the IPCC category level or for the specific component in question. If the problem is limited to only one IPCC category, only the estimate for that source or sink should be adjusted. Similarly, if only one component of a given estimate is problematic (such as inconsistent, incorrect or misapplied emission factors or other inventory parameters, or activity data), the review team should replace only that component in calculating the adjusted estimate. For land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCEF) estimates, consideration should be given to the spatial disaggregation of estimates, where relevant and applicable. 23. If the necessary input data or parameters are not available at the IPCC category level at which the problem is identified, or the problem involves more than one component of an emission or removal estimation method used by the Party, or the complexity of the methodology used does not allow replacing only the problematic component in question, more aggregate data should be used as the basis for the adjustment. However, expert review teams should make every effort to make the adjustment at the levels at which the problems were identified, in order to avoid making data that do not qualify for an adjustment subject to the adjustment. A. Choice of methods 24, If an emission or removal estimate needs to be adjusted,’ the expert review team should choose one of the basic adjustment methods in this technical guidance for the calculation of an estimate for purposes of adjustment. 25. In choosing the basic adjustment method and the input data that are appropriate for a specific adjustment case, expert review teams should, in general, follow the methods listed in priority order in table 1, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated in the sector-specific elements included in chapter IV. If the requirements for the highest priority adjustment method according to the table are not available, the next preferred adjustment method should be used. 26. If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the [IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two years’ estimates are missing, a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method. 27. If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency, and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the cause ? For example, if an emission or removal estimate is missing, if the estimation method used by the Party was not in conformity with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, or if there is a problem with more than one component (emission factor, activity data or other parameter) of the estimation method used by the Party. of the potential deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance (such as inappropriate activity data, emission factors or methods), expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1. Table 1. Basic adjustment methods to obtain an emission/removal estimate (in order of priority) Basic adjustment method Requirements/applicability 1 Default IPCC tier 1 Obtain activity data, emission factors and other estimation parameters following the prioritizations indicated in paragraphs 33 and 34 below 2 Extrapolation of emissions or Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in removals question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates is available 2 Extrapolation of emissions or removals Extrapolation/interpolation of emissions or removals based on a driver Correlation of emissions or removals between source/sink categories or gases within an Y Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates and a corresponding driver are available Emission or removal estimate for the gas/source/sink category that is correlated to the emissions or removals that need adjustment 4 Correlation of emissions or removals between source/sink categories or gases within an 5 Average emission or removal rate Driver for the country in question and emission or removal from a cluster of countries based rate per driver for a cluster of countries on a driver Note: The methods in this table are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section III.D below. Further details on the basic adjustment methods listed in this table are given in section III.C below. 28. In the exceptional case where none of the basic adjustment methods listed in table 1 is suitable for a given adjustment case, expert review teams may use other adjustment methods. If adjustment methods other than those included in this technical guidance are applied, expert review teams should report the reason for not using any of the basic adjustment methods of this technical guidance and should justify why they consider the method chosen as appropriate. B. Choice of data and other components 29. In choosing any input data for calculating an adjustment, expert review teams should give, as appropriate, preference to the national data available in the respective Party’s inventory submission or made available by the Party before or during the review, provided that these data were not the cause for the adjustment. 30. Expert review teams should not conduct time-consuming searches for national data that have not been made available to the review team by the Party, or generate new country-specific data. 31. If national data as indicated in paragraph 29 above are not available or are not deemed suitable for the respective adjustment case, expert review teams should select data from the recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix L. 32. The international data sources to be included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should meet most of the following criteria: The organizations that make the data available are recognized intergovernmental organizations (e.g. United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Energy Agency (IEA)) (a) The data are regularly updated, maintained and disseminated (b) The data are originally generated by the countries themselves (national statistics) (©) The data are widely applicable to Annex I Parties (d) The data are easily accessible by the secretariat and expert review teams (e.g. through Internet or CD-ROM)), in a timely manner and at reasonable cost () Sufficient information is available to assess the applicability of activity data, drivers, emission factors or other estimation parameters (e.g. descriptions of how the data are collected, which definitions are used, geographic coverage). ® 1. Choice of activity data 33. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of activity data, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the activity data are the cause of the adjustment, and if no national data are available, expert review teams should use, in order of preference: Recommended international data sources as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I (a) Extrapolation (interpolation) methods if the international data sources do not provide data for the year in question, in which case the activity data should be obtained as follows (in order of preference): (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) of national activity data, if these data are available as required in paragraph 29 above, and were collected in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (1) Extrapolation (interpolation) of data from recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I (i) Extrapolation (interpolation) using drivers or surrogate data from the inventory review resources listed in appendix I (iii) Activity data based on appropriate drivers (e.g. activity data per capita) from a cluster of countries following the provisions of paragraphs 35-38 below. (©) 2. Choice of emission factors or other inventory parameters 34. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of an emission factor or other inventory parameter, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the emission factor or other inventory parameter itself is the cause of the adjustment, the expert review team should use, in order of preference: IPCC default values from the IPCC good practice guidance, the IPCC Guidelines or other recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I, and consistent with the [IPCC good practice guidance. If emission factors or other inventory parameters from other international data sources are used, the expert review team should, in the review report, justify and document the reason for their use (a) Extrapolation (interpolation) of the national emission factor, implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from earlier years as reported in the common reporting format (CRF) or national inventory report if the factor in question was prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (b) Average implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from a cluster of countries obtained as described in paragraphs 35-38 below. (©) 3. Choice of drivers and clusters 35. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use of a driver, the expert review team should use the recommended drivers as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. 36. If an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries is used, expert review teams should follow the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. The inclusion in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I of drivers and approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data should be subject to guidance by lead reviewers in accordance with the provisions of appendix 1. 37. Expert review teams should report the reason for the use of drivers and clusters and demonstrate the appropriateness of the cluster and/or the correlation between the driver and the emissions or removals. The use of drivers or approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data other than those recommended in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should be explained and justified. 38. When using an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries, assumptions made in choosing the cluster should be documented, as should how the given inventory average parameter compares with the default parameter or range provided in the IPCC good practice guidance or [IPCC Guidelines, where available. Similarly, when clustering is related to the use of a driver (application of an average driver-based emission or removal rate) from a cluster of countries, assumptions made for the composition of the cluster and the established relationship with the driver should be documented. 39. The clusters'” to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria, taking into account expert judgement: Only Annex I Parties that have undergone an individual review, and for which the relevant data were deemed accurate during the review process and for which no adjustment to any inventory parameter of the gases or categories concerned was made, should be included. Inventory data from the Party subject to adjustment should be excluded from the cluster (a) The cluster should cover a minimum number of countries, as specified in the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data (b) The grouping of countries into clusters should, to the extent possible, take into account similar national circumstances. National circumstances could relate to, inter alia, climatic conditions, economic development, operation or management practices, types of oil and gas activity, or the age of equipment or installations and their technical features, forest, land-use and soil characteristics, depending on the source or sink category in question. (©) 40. The drivers to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria: The driver shall be adequately correlated with the emissions or removals concerned (a) ' Because of the need to use reviewed data from other countries, clustering will only be possible for one year prior to the year in question. This implies that clustering would have to be combined with extrapolation techniques. The significance of the relationship between the driver used and the emissions or removals calculated needs to be demonstrated, taking into account national circumstances. (b) C. Details and variations on the basic adjustment methods 41. The following section provides further guidance on the application of the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A above. Because this section covers possible variations of those methods, the numbering and ordering do not match the list in table 1. 1. Default IPCC tier 1 methods 42. This basic adjustment method refers to default IPCC tier 1 methods as described in the IPCC Guidelines and as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance. If this adjustment method is used, the IPCC good practice guidance should always be consulted before the IPCC Guidelines. This adjustment method will only be applicable if activity data are available from national sources in accordance with paragraph 29 above or from international data sources as described in paragraph 31 above, or are obtained as described in paragraph 33 above. An emission factor or other inventory parameter as required by the method and obtained as described in paragraph 34 above should be used. 2. Extrapolation and interpolation methods 43. If extrapolation and/or interpolation methods are used, the expert review team should follow the guidance on trend extrapolation and interpolation provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, in particular, section 7.3.2.2 of the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and section 5.6. of the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. 44, Extrapolation of emission or removal estimates is applicable if inventory estimates are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the beginning (base year) and/or the end (latest inventory year) of the time series, and reviewed and time-series-consistent values are available for most years of the time series. 45. Extrapolation of inventory parameters (e.g. activity data): in addition to applying extrapolation methods to emission or removal estimates it may be necessary to use extrapolation at the level of activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). 46. Extrapolation of emissions or removals using drivers or surrogate data can be applied if inventory estimates are available for some years (at a minimum for all years but two) of the time series but are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the required year (base year and/or latest inventory year). The emissions or removals need to be strongly correlated with other well-known and more readily available indicative data (drivers). 47. Interpolation is applicable for calculating an adjustment for a given inventory year provided that reviewed values of the adjacent years are available. This method would most likely be applied in exceptional cases only, but could be applicable to activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances. 3. Adjustment methods based on correlation of emissions/removals between categories or gases 48. Correlation of emissions or removals between categories or gases within an inventory could in some cases be used to estimate emissions or removals of a specific gas or from a specific category. For example, CH, and N,O emissions from fuel combustion activities could be calculated from CO, emissions, if available. 4. Adjustment methods based on clustering of countries 49. Application of average inventory parameters from a cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances for the sector in question could be used to correct any inventory parameter (e.g. emission factor) that was found not to be in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance, or as input to the IPCC tier 1 method. The inventory review resources listed in appendix I provide recommended approaches and tools for clustering inventory data. If an adjustment has to be made for a given country, expert review teams should assign the Party in question to the cluster of countries to which it would most likely belong according to its national circumstances. 50. Application of an average driver-based emission/removal rate from a cluster of countries can be used if an emission or removal estimate is missing entirely or was not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance, but data for a parameter driving the emissions or removals from that source or sink are available for the country in question. The estimate is derived by establishing a relationship between emissions/removals and an appropriate driver for the cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances, and applying this relationship to the Party in question. If data for the driver are not available for the year in question, the driver should be extrapolated as described in paragraph 46 above. D. Conservative approach 51. The choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that emission estimates for the base year are not overestimated, and that emission estimates for a year of the commitment period are not underestimated relative to the likely true value of the emissions of the Party concerned. 52. Similarly, the choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that removal estimates for the base year are not underestimated, and that removal estimates for a year of the commitment period are not overestimated relative to the likely true value of the removals of the Party concerned. 53. As a principle to achieve conservative estimates, the calculation of an adjustment for a commitment period year should not result in an emission estimate that is lower or a removal estimate that is higher than that originally submitted by the Party, and an adjustment for an estimate of the base year should not result in an emission estimate that is higher or a removal estimate that is lower than the originally submitted estimate. 54. To ensure conservativeness for the purpose of adjustments, a conservativeness factor should be applied to the specific component of the estimation method used by the Party or to the emission/removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A of this technical guidance. For illustration purposes, this approach may be expressed as: M x CF = Adjusted estimate Where M is the component of an estimation method used by a Party, or the emission or removal estimate generated by a basic adjustment method in this technical guidance, and CF is the conservativeness factor. 55. The conservativeness factor should be selected from the tables of conservativeness factors provided in appendix III to this technical guidance. In the case that the tables do not provide a conservativeness factor for a given source/sink category, a conservativeness factor for a category with similar characteristics should be used. 56. For cases where only one component of an estimation method used by a Party is replaced, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to that component, in accordance with paragraph 22 above. In other cases, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to the emission or removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment method, in accordance with paragraph 24 above. 57. If, exceptionally, an expert review team considers that, in its expert judgement, the estimate generated by applying the basic approach referred to in paragraph 54 above is not conservative or is overly conservative for the Party concerned,'' the expert review team may use an alternative approach for applying conservativeness, and, where applicable, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 22 and 28 above. The expert review team shall justify and document the technical reason for its decision, and for its choice of the alternative approach used, and include this information in the review report. IV. Sector-specific elements 58. When calculating adjustments, expert review teams should follow the provisions of chapter 111 taking into account the sector-specific elements given below, as appropriate. The provisions of this chapter apply to the calculation of the adjustments before applying the conservativeness factor described in section IIL.D above. A. Fuel combustion 59. When adjusting CO, emissions from one or several disaggregated IPCC source categories, care should be taken that total CO, emissions are in accordance with the total fuel consumption, which is generally better known than the fuel consumption in each of the disaggregated IPCC source categories. 60. In the event that total CO, emissions from fuel combustion need to be adjusted, the reference approach is the preferred option for calculating an adjustment. Reference approach estimates should preferably be taken from the Party. If this is not considered appropriate, emission estimates from the IEA can be used. 61. If an N,O emission factor from road transport needs to be replaced, increased use of catalytic converters leading to increased emission factors should be taken into account when calculating an adjustment. B. Industrial processes 62. The expert review team should consider the possibility of double counting (for instance, the use of lime in iron and steel production) and avoid any double counting through the application of adjustments. 63. If adjusting hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), perfluorocarbon (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SFy) estimates from the consumption of halocarbons and SF;, consideration should be given to the uncertainty of sales figures (e.g. for sales of these chemicals to the foam blowing industry) and other parameters (such as the composition of the mix in coolants) as given in the IPCC good practice guidance. C. Agriculture 64. When adjusting emissions from agricultural soils, preference should be given to tier 1.a methods as provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. "" That is, the expert review team believes that the likely true value of the emissions or removals from a source/sink for a year of the commitment period is higher or much lower than the adjusted estimate generated, or the true value of the emissions from a source in the base year is lower or much higher than the adjusted estimate generated, taking into account any guidance from lead reviewers on this matter. 65. The expert review team should note that when adjusting emissions from manure management systems, savannah burning, or field burning of agricultural residues, the same activity data should be used for CH, as for N,O. 66. Similarly, consistent livestock data should be used for CH, and N,O emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management, and for N,O emissions from animal manure applied to soils. D. Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) 67. When using data from a cluster of countries, data should be selected on the basis of the similarity of these countries in relation to: National circumstances such as climatic conditions, vegetation types, management regimes, national policies and others (a) Choices in relation to definitions, data acquisition methods, and reporting of carbon pools'? and of activities in accordance with decision /CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7. (b) 68. Adjustments should not be applied in the case that a Party has not reported a category contained in appendices to chapter 3 of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry unless it was previously included in the inventory. 69. Estimates of emissions and removals in the LULUCEF sector and from LULUCEF activities may be based not on annual data but on extrapolations and may be recalculated at a later stage. For this reason, the application of an adjustment to the base year of cropland management, grazing land management or revegetation through an extrapolation should be done with care, given that data may not be reported for the years between the base year and the commitment period. If an extrapolation is needed for the base year of these activities, the expert review team could use as a driver the time series for the LULUCF sector included in the annual inventory submission under the Convention. 70. When expert review teams are choosing a basic adjustment method from table 1 for the LULUCF sector, they should carefully assess whether the IPCC tier 1 methods are indeed the most appropriate methods to derive a conservative estimate. E. Waste 71. Data on populations and/or urban populations, and GDP per capita, could be used in some cases to estimate the volume of solid waste, taking into account national circumstances. Urban population and protein consumption data could be used to obtain activity data to estimate emissions from domestic waste-water handling. Production data associated with the main industries in a specific country could be used as a possible driver to estimate the amount of industrial waste water, taking into account differences in technologies (e.g. emission per unit production). 72. For activity data, a cluster of countries based mainly on waste management practices could be used for estimating certain types of data, such as the waste generation rate, but not for estimating other types of data, such as the amount of waste incinerated or the amount of waste deposited, because these data largely depend on national environmental waste management policies. 73. When adjusting emissions from waste incineration, the applicability of drivers is very limited. ""2 If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. 73. 74. When adjusting emissions from solid waste disposal sites or waste-water treatment, the recovery of the methane needs to be considered. For solid waste disposal the expert review team should also take into account that if activity data are constant or increasing and the country used the IPCC tier 1 default method, this will have resulted in a conservative emission estimate. APPENDIX I List of inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments This appendix lists inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments using the adjustment methods and approaches described in the technical guidance. The information contained in the inventory review resources listed here will be maintained by the UNFCCC secretariat and made available to expert review teams by electronic means.

APPENDIX II Provisions for review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol that relate to adjustments I. Timing 1. Within the review of the inventory, the expert review team shall list all the problems identified, indicating which would need an adjustment, and send this list to the Annex I Party no later than 25 weeks from the submission due date of the annual inventory. This list should be prepared under the collective responsibility of the expert review team. 2. The Annex I Party shall comment on these questions within six weeks and, where requested by the review team, may provide revised estimates. 3. If adjustments are still needed, the expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with this technical guidance, in consultation with the Party concerned, and shall prepare a individual inventory review report which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates and related information, within eight weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed, and shall send the report to the Party concerned. 4. The Annex [ Party shall be provided with four weeks to comment on the individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether, and for what reasons, it accepts or rejects the adjustment. If the Party concerned disagrees with the proposed adjustment(s) the expert review team should send the notification from the Party, along with the recommendation of the expert review team, in its final report to the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. II. Reporting 5.

(k) APPENDIX III Tables of conservativeness factors 1. This appendix provides two sets of tables of conservativeness factors to be used in the calculation of adjustments to ensure that adjusted estimates are conservative, in accordance with paragraphs 51 and 52 of the technical guidance. The first set of tables (tables 1 and 2) covers conservativeness factors for sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol. The second set of tables (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a and 4.b) covers conservativeness factors for emissions and removals from LULUCEF. For both sets of tables, these conservativeness factors are provided in two parts: For Annex A sources, one for use in the calculation of adjustments for a base year estimate and one for the calculation of adjustments for a year of the commitment period (a) For estimates of emissions and removals from LULUCF, separate factors are provided for emissions and removals, for use in the calculation of adjustments to the LULUCF sector during the initial review for the purpose of establishing a Party’s assigned amount (tables 3.a and 3.b), and for use in the calculation of adjustments of activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4 (tables 4.a and 4.b). (b) 2. In all tables, conservativeness factors are provided for emission factors or other estimation parameters, activity data, and emission or removal estimates for each IPCC category and Article 3, paragraph 3 and 4 activity, and corresponding gas. 3. When a given category is not covered in the table, the provision of paragraph 55 of the technical guidance applies, such as for categories “other” under industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, waste and the IPCC sector “7 Other”. 4. The conservativeness factors in these tables will be updated, as required, following the collective recommendation of lead reviewers, subject to approval by the SBSTA. Application of conservativeness factors to estimates from LULUCEF (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, 4.b) 5. According to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the technical guidance, adjustments should be applied at the lowest level possible at which the problem is identified. Therefore, there might be a need to apply adjustments to individual components (e.g. emission factors, inventory parameters or activity data) as well as to estimates of carbon stock changes from individual carbon pools. 6. To ensure that the selection of the conservativeness factors from the tables of conservativeness factors for LULUCF contributes to a conservative adjustment in line with paragraph 53 of the guidance, the expert review team should determine whether the individual component or the carbon stock change from the individual pool subject to adjustment leads to an increase of either emissions or removals, and choose the conservativeness factor accordingly from the respective tables, taking into account the year to which the adjustment is applied (base year or year of the commitment period, as appropriate). For any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing emissions, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.a, 4.a or 4.b as appropriate; for any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing removals, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.b, 4.a or 4.b, as appropriate. Background information on the preparation of the tables of conservativeness factors 7. The conservativeness factors are derived from uncertainty values and parameters provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, and in some cases are determined by expert judgement for the purpose of this technical guidance, as indicated below: If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for a component, this range for that component is used; (a) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for emissions or removals from a particular category or a combined uncertainty range can be calculated from the uncertainty values and/or ranges of the input parameters using the tier 1 method, the range generated by applying the uncertainty value for the category is used; (b) In cases where the [IPCC good practice guidance does not provide an uncertainty range for an estimate or a combined uncertainty range cannot be calculated because necessary information is not available, an assessed uncertainty range determined by expert judgement for the purposes of this technical guidance is used. (©) 8. Different conservativeness factors are provided for use in adjustments to estimate for a base year and for a year of the commitment period. The conservativeness factors are calculated using the 25"" or 75"" percentile of the range generated by an uncertainty value for the gas and category, as appropriate, for use in an adjustment for the base year, or a year of the commitment period, assuming a log-normal distribution. 9. The uncertainty values have been grouped into five sets of uncertainty bands, with corresponding conservativeness factors, by assigning a given uncertainty value to a given band. These bands relate to the underlying uncertainties, as follows: Conservativeness factors for emissions in the base year Conservativeness factor for emissions in a year of the Estimated uncertainty Assigned and/or removals in a commitment period range uncertainty band year of the and/or removals in the (%) (%) commitment period base year Less than or equal to 10 7 0.98 1.02 Greater than 10 and less than 20 0.94 1.06 or equal to 30 Greater than 30 and less than 40 0.89 1.12 or equal to 50 Greater than 50 and less than 75 0.82 1.21 or equal to 100 Greater than 100 150 0.73 1.37 40 1.21 75 Table 1 Conservativeness factors for adjustments in the base year (for sources in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol) Activity Emission estimates [CO, [ N,0 Jkcs[PEG SF, N e e I - — — emeawie Tow[ow en ] ow [ lom[on ] 2 Vanutucnring mdusiies andcomsmstion | 098 [ 02 [ 073 | ||| oo Joss[om[on| || | I 0 3 3.

Notes that local integration in the refugee context is a sovereign decision and an option to be exercised by States guided by their treaty obligations and human rights principles and that it is a dynamic and multifaceted two-way process requiring efforts by all parties concerned, including a preparedness on the part of refugees to adapt to the host society without having to forego their own cultural identity and a corresponding readiness on the part of host communities and public institutions to welcome refugees and to meet the needs of a diverse population, and acknowledges that the process of local integration is complex and gradual, comprising three distinct but interrelated legal, economic and social and cultural dimensions, all of which are important to the ability of refugees to integrate successfully; 17. Acknowledges that the global refugee situation represents an international challenge requiring that international burden- and responsibility-sharing be addressed effectively, and recognizes that allowing for local integration, where applicable, is an act of States that is a durable solution for refugees, which contributes to said burden- and responsibility-sharing, without prejudice to the specific situation of certain developing countries facing mass influxes; 18. Emphasizes the obligation of all States to accept the return of their nationals, calls upon States to facilitate the return of their nationals who have been determined not to be in need of international protection, and affirms the need for the A/C.3/60/L.65 return of persons to be undertaken in a safe and humane manner and with full respect for their human rights and dignity, irrespective of the status of the persons concerned; 19. Condemns all acts that pose a threat to the personal security and well- being of refugees and asylum-seekers, such as refoulement, unlawful expulsion and physical attacks, and calls upon all States of refuge, in cooperation with international organizations where appropriate, to take all necessary measures to ensure respect for the principles of refugee protection, including the humane treatment of asylum-seekers; 20. Affirms the importance of mainstreaming the protection needs of women and children to ensure their participation in the planning and implementation of programmes of the Office of the High Commissioner and State policies and the importance of according priority to addressing the problem of sexual and gender- based violence; 21. Encourages the Office of the High Commissioner to continue to improve its management systems and to ensure effective and transparent use of its resources, recognizes that adequate and timely resources are essential for the Office to continue to fulfil the mandate conferred upon it through its statute!3 and by subsequent General Assembly resolutions concerning refugees and other persons of concern, recalls its resolutions 58/153, 58/270 of 23 December 2003 and 59/170 of 20 December 2004, concerning the implementation of paragraph 20 of the Office’s statute, and urges Governments and other donors to respond promptly to annual and supplementary appeals issued by the Office for requirements under its programmes; 22.

Endorses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as accepted by the sixteenth session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change held in Montreal, Canada, 1 to 8 May 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance), as an elaboration of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; 2. Decides that the IPCC good practice guidance referred to in paragraph 1 shall be used by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) in their preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories under the Kyoto Protocol; 3. Decides that adjustments referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol shall be applied only when inventory data submitted by Annex I Parties are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; 4. Decides that the calculation of adjustments shall commence only after an Annex I Party has been provided with opportunities to correct any deficiencies in accordance with the time frame and procedures set forth in the guidelines for inventory review under Article §; 5. Decides that the adjustment procedure shall result in estimates that are conservative for the Party concerned so as to ensure that anthropogenic emissions are not underestimated and anthropogenic removals by sinks and anthropogenic base year emissions are not overestimated; 6. Emphasizes that adjustments are intended to provide an incentive for Annex I Parties to provide complete and accurate annual greenhouse gas inventories prepared in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments are intended to correct inventory problems for the purpose of accounting emissions inventories and assigned amounts of the Annex I Parties. Adjustments are not intended to substitute for the obligation of an Annex I Party to estimate and report greenhouse gas inventories in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; 7. Decides that adjusted estimates shall be calculated in accordance with the technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments contained in the annex to this decision. Such technical guidance shall ensure consistency and comparability and that similar methods are used for similar problems as far as possible across all inventories reviewed under Article §; 8. Decides that any adjustments applied to the base year inventory estimates of an Annex I Party shall be used in the calculation of the Party’s assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, in accordance with the modalities for the accounting of assigned amount under Article 7, paragraph 4, and shall not be replaced by a revised estimate subsequent to the establishment of the Party’s assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and &; 9. Decides that any adjustments applied to the inventory for a year of the commitment period of the Annex I Party shall be used in the annual compilation and accounting of emission inventories and assigned amounts; 10. Decides that in the event of a disagreement between the Annex I Party and the expert review team regarding the adjustment, the issue will be forwarded to the Compliance Committee; 11. Decides that an Annex I Party may submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory of a year of the commitment period to which an adjustment was previously applied, provided that the revised estimate is submitted, at the latest, in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012. Subject to a review under Article 8 and the acceptance of the revised estimate by the expert review team, the revised estimate shall replace the adjusted estimate. In the event of a disagreement between the Annex I Party and the expert review team regarding the revised estimate, the issue will be forwarded to the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. The option for an Annex I Party to submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied should not prevent Annex I Parties from making best efforts to correct the problem at the time it was initially identified and in accordance with the time frame set forth in the guidelines for review under Article 8. ANNEX Technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol I. Objective 1. The objective of this technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol' is: (a) To provide for adjusted estimates that fully meet the requirements of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7;? (b) To ensure that adjustments are applied consistently,’ comparably and transparently, taking into account the time frames provided in the guidelines for review under Article 8, and that, as far as possible, similar methods are used for similar problems across all inventories subject to adjustments under Article 8. II. General approach 2. This technical guidance establishes general and specific procedures and methods for use by expert review teams to calculate adjustments. These procedures and methods are supplemented by inventory review resources listed in appendix I to this technical guidance, which will also facilitate consistency in calculation of adjustments by expert review teams. A. Procedures 3. The calculation and application of adjustments shall follow paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7. 4. Adjustments shall be applied, taking into account section II.B below, only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) including supplementary inventory data on Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC Guidelines) as elaborated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry* (hereinafter referred to collectively as the IPCC good practice guidance), and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). ! All articles referred to in this technical guidance are those of the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol are hereinafter referred to as adjustments. ? In this context, consistency means that the application of adjustments should be consistent across Parties and by all expert review teams. 5. Expert review teams shall, under their collective responsibility, calculate, document and recommend adjustments in accordance with the provisions for the review of annual inventories under Article 8 and this technical guidance. A compilation of the provisions relevant to the timing and reporting of adjustments from these guidelines is included in appendix II to this technical guidance. 6. The expert review team should collectively decide on the methodological approach for calculation of any adjustment, including relevant components of the adjustment method (such as data sources, drivers’ and clusters® used). 7. Expert review teams should apply the appropriate adjustment method, selected from table 1, in a simple manner, given the limited time available for the calculation of adjustments according to the provisions for the review of annual inventories in the guidelines for review under Article 8 (see paragraph 3 of appendix II). 8. Expert review teams should apply this technical guidance in a consistent and comparable manner and, as far as possible, use similar methods for similar problems across all inventories reviewed under Article 8, taking into account the provisions for obtaining conservative estimates, as described in paragraphs 51 and 52 below. 9. To enhance consistency in the application of adjustments for any given Party, the same adjustment method should be used, whenever possible, in cases where the same inventory problem was adjusted in an earlier year (e.g. for the base year or for an earlier year of the commitment period). This provision applies to both the basic adjustment method,” and the main components used in the calculation of the adjustment, as appropriate, such as the source of international data, drivers, clusters and any other inventory parameter used. 10. Any adjustments to estimates of emissions and removals for purposes of establishing the assigned amount under Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, will only be applied during the initial review under Article 8. 11. Adjustments should be applied only for individual inventory years, specifically the base year or the latest year of the commitment period under review, and not for an entire time series or group of years, except for cases described in paragraphs 12 and 13 (b)—(c) below. 12. Adjustments should not be retroactively applied for any year preceding the inventory year subject to review, except in cases where recalculated estimates for previous commitment period years and/or instances relating to paragraph 13 (c) below were submitted by the Party together with the inventory information of the inventory year subject to review. Where the Party submits recalculated estimates for commitment period years prior to the inventory year subject to review, adjustments may be applied retroactively for those estimates that have not yet been reviewed, if the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. 13. For estimates of emissions and removals resulting from activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, adjustments may be applied to an individual year or for a group of years, as follows: (a) For activities for which the Party has chosen to account annually, any adjustments should be applied during the annual review for the latest submitted inventory; > For the purpose of this technical guidance, driver refers to indicative data other than activity data or other inventory parameters used in the calculation of emission or removal estimates, that are correlated with emissions or removals, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, associated production data, wells drilled, GDP per capita. The criteria for selecting drivers for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 40. ® For the purpose of this technical guidance, cluster refers to inventory-related data from a group of countries. The criteria for selecting clusters for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 39. 7 For the purpose of this technical guidance, basic adjustment methods are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section II1.D below. (a) For activities for which the Party has chosen to account for the entire commitment period, any adjustments should be considered and applied for any individual year or for any group of years of the commitment period, as necessary, only during the annual review for the final year of the commitment period. Adjustments shall not be considered or applied during any annual review prior to that for the final year of the commitment period; (b) For cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation under Article 3, paragraph 4, any adjustment to the emissions or removals in the base year resulting from these activities should be considered and applied according to the choice made by a Party regarding the periodicity of accounting of these activities (e.g. annually or at the end of the commitment period). In the case that the Party has chosen to account annually for these activities and submits recalculated estimates, adjustments may be applied retroactively for the base year, provided these recalculated estimates have not yet been subject to review and the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. (©) 14. The selection of data and other components required for an adjustment method should take into account the time series for any such component. 15. Even if some aspects of a particular case are not fully covered by this technical guidance, the experts calculating the adjustment shall adhere to paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) and, as closely as possible, to this technical guidance. B. Applicability of adjustments 16. In considering the need for an adjustment, expert review teams should adhere to standard inventory review approaches, which also include assessment of the time series for a given estimate. 17. If the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of emissions in the base year, or an overestimation of emissions in a year of the commitment period, the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied, if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate with a value for the base year that is higher than the original estimate submitted by the Party or a value for a year of the commitment period that is lower than the original estimate. 18. Similarly, if the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of removals resulting from any activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, in a year of the commitment period, or an overestimation of removals in the base year for any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4 (cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation), the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate that is less conservative than the original estimate submitted by the Party. 19. An adjustment procedure should be initiated if the information provided by the Party is not sufficiently transparent, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 4 above. 20. If the expert review team identifies a deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance that is caused by the allocation of estimates to a wrong category or activity under Article 3, paragraph 3 or 4, adjustments should not be applied in the following cases:® ¥ In these cases, reallocation is recommended to the Party as part of the review of annual inventories under Article 8. If reallocation to the correct source category does not affect total emissions from sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol (a) (b) If the reallocation does not affect the accounting of emissions and/or removals from any individual activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4. 21. If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. (b) III. Methods and conservativeness 22. In general, expert review teams shall calculate each adjustment at the level at which the problem is identified, e.g. the IPCC category level or for the specific component in question. If the problem is limited to only one IPCC category, only the estimate for that source or sink should be adjusted. Similarly, if only one component of a given estimate is problematic (such as inconsistent, incorrect or misapplied emission factors or other inventory parameters, or activity data), the review team should replace only that component in calculating the adjusted estimate. For land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) estimates, consideration should be given to the spatial disaggregation of estimates, where relevant and applicable. 23. If the necessary input data or parameters are not available at the [IPCC category level at which the problem is identified, or the problem involves more than one component of an emission or removal estimation method used by the Party, or the complexity of the methodology used does not allow replacing only the problematic component in question, more aggregate data should be used as the basis for the adjustment. However, expert review teams should make every effort to make the adjustment at the levels at which the problems were identified, in order to avoid making data that do not qualify for an adjustment subject to the adjustment. A. Choice of methods 24, If an emission or removal estimate needs to be adjusted,’ the expert review team should choose one of the basic adjustment methods in this technical guidance for the calculation of an estimate for purposes of adjustment. 25. In choosing the basic adjustment method and the input data that are appropriate for a specific adjustment case, expert review teams should, in general, follow the methods listed in priority order in table 1, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated in the sector-specific elements included in chapter IV. If the requirements for the highest priority adjustment method according to the table are not available, the next preferred adjustment method should be used. 26. If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two years’ estimates are missing, a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method. ? For example, if an emission or removal estimate is missing, if the estimation method used by the Party was not in conformity with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, or if there is a problem with more than one component (emission factor, activity data or other parameter) of the estimation method used by the Party. 27. If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency, and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the cause of the potential deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance (such as inappropriate activity data, emission factors or methods), expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1. Table 1. Basic adjustment methods to obtain an emission/removal estimate (in order of priority) Basic adjustment method Requirements/applicability 1 Default IPCC tier 1 Obtain activity data, emission factors and other estimation parameters following the prioritizations indicated in paragraphs 33 and 34 below 2 Extrapolation of emissions or Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in removals question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates is available 2 Extrapolation of emissions or removals Extrapolation/interpolation of emissions or removals based on a driver Correlation of emissions or removals between source/sink categories or gases within an L Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates and a corresponding driver are available Emission or removal estimate for the gas/source/sink category that is correlated to the emissions or removals that need adjustment 4 Correlation of emissions or Emission or removal estimate for the gas/source/sink removals between source/sink category that is correlated to the emissions or removals categories or gases within an that need adjustment 5 Average emission or removal rate Driver for the country in question and emission or removal from a cluster of countries based rate per driver for a cluster of countries on a driver Note: The methods in this table are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section III.D below. Further details on the basic adjustment methods listed in this table are given in section III.C below. 28. In the exceptional case where none of the basic adjustment methods listed in table 1 is suitable for a given adjustment case, expert review teams may use other adjustment methods. If adjustment methods other than those included in this technical guidance are applied, expert review teams should report the reason for not using any of the basic adjustment methods of this technical guidance and should justify why they consider the method chosen as appropriate. B. Choice of data and other components 29. In choosing any input data for calculating an adjustment, expert review teams should give, as appropriate, preference to the national data available in the respective Party’s inventory submission or made available by the Party before or during the review, provided that these data were not the cause for the adjustment. 30. Expert review teams should not conduct time-consuming searches for national data that have not been made available to the review team by the Party, or generate new country-specific data. 31. If national data as indicated in paragraph 29 above are not available or are not deemed suitable for the respective adjustment case, expert review teams should select data from the recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix 1. 32. The international data sources to be included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should meet most of the following criteria: (a) The organizations that make the data available are recognized intergovernmental organizations (e.g. United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Energy Agency (IEA)) The data are regularly updated, maintained and disseminated The data are originally generated by the countries themselves (national statistics) (b) (©) (d) The data are widely applicable to Annex I Parties (e) The data are easily accessible by the secretariat and expert review teams (e.g. through Internet or CD-ROM)), in a timely manner and at reasonable cost (d) ) Sufficient information is available to assess the applicability of activity data, drivers, emission factors or other estimation parameters (e.g. descriptions of how the data are collected, which definitions are used, geographic coverage). 1. Choice of activity data 33. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of activity data, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the activity data are the cause of the adjustment, and if no national data are available, expert review teams should use, in order of preference: (a) Recommended international data sources as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix | (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) methods if the international data sources do not provide data for the year in question, in which case the activity data should be obtained as follows (in order of preference): Extrapolation (interpolation) of national activity data, if these data are available as required in paragraph 29 above, and were collected in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (1) Extrapolation (interpolation) of data from recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix | Extrapolation (interpolation) using drivers or surrogate data from the inventory review resources listed in appendix [ (ii) (iii) (o) Activity data based on appropriate drivers (e.g. activity data per capita) from a cluster of countries following the provisions of paragraphs 35-38 below. 2. Choice of emission factors or other inventory parameters 34. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of an emission factor or other inventory parameter, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the emission factor or other inventory parameter itself is the cause of the adjustment, the expert review team should use, in order of preference: (a) IPCC default values from the IPCC good practice guidance, the IPCC Guidelines or other recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I, and consistent with the IPCC good practice guidance. If emission factors or other inventory parameters from other international data sources are used, the expert review team should, in the review report, justify and document the reason for their use (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) of the national emission factor, implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from earlier years as reported in the common reporting format (CRF) or national inventory report if the factor in question was prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (c) Average implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from a cluster of countries obtained as described in paragraphs 35-38 below. 3. Choice of drivers and clusters 35. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use of a driver, the expert review team should use the recommended drivers as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. 36. If an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries is used, expert review teams should follow the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. The inclusion in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I of drivers and approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data should be subject to guidance by lead reviewers in accordance with the provisions of appendix . 37. Expert review teams should report the reason for the use of drivers and clusters and demonstrate the appropriateness of the cluster and/or the correlation between the driver and the emissions or removals. The use of drivers or approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data other than those recommended in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should be explained and justified. 38. When using an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries, assumptions made in choosing the cluster should be documented, as should how the given inventory average parameter compares with the default parameter or range provided in the IPCC good practice guidance or IPCC Guidelines, where available. Similarly, when clustering is related to the use of a driver (application of an average driver-based emission or removal rate) from a cluster of countries, assumptions made for the composition of the cluster and the established relationship with the driver should be documented. 39. The clusters'® to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria, taking into account expert judgement: (a) Only Annex I Parties that have undergone an individual review, and for which the relevant data were deemed accurate during the review process and for which no adjustment to any inventory parameter of the gases or categories concerned was made, should be included. Inventory data from the Party subject to adjustment should be excluded from the cluster (a) The cluster should cover a minimum number of countries, as specified in the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data The grouping of countries into clusters should, to the extent possible, take into account similar national circumstances. National circumstances could relate to, inter alia, climatic conditions, economic development, operation or management practices, types of oil and gas activity, or the age of equipment or installations and their technical features, forest, land-use and soil characteristics, depending on the source or sink category in question. (b) (©) 40. The drivers to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria: 12 Because of the need to use reviewed data from other countries, clustering will only be possible for one year prior to the year in question. This implies that clustering would have to be combined with extrapolation techniques. The driver shall be adequately correlated with the emissions or removals concerned (a) (b) The significance of the relationship between the driver used and the emissions or removals calculated needs to be demonstrated, taking into account national circumstances. C. Details and variations on the basic adjustment methods 41. The following section provides further guidance on the application of the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A above. Because this section covers possible variations of those methods, the numbering and ordering do not match the list in table 1. 1. Default IPCC tier 1 methods 42. This basic adjustment method refers to default IPCC tier 1 methods as described in the [PCC Guidelines and as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance. If this adjustment method is used, the IPCC good practice guidance should always be consulted before the IPCC Guidelines. This adjustment method will only be applicable if activity data are available from national sources in accordance with paragraph 29 above or from international data sources as described in paragraph 31 above, or are obtained as described in paragraph 33 above. An emission factor or other inventory parameter as required by the method and obtained as described in paragraph 34 above should be used. 2. Extrapolation and interpolation methods 43. If extrapolation and/or interpolation methods are used, the expert review team should follow the guidance on trend extrapolation and interpolation provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, in particular, section 7.3.2.2 of the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and section 5.6. of the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. 44, Extrapolation of emission or removal estimates is applicable if inventory estimates are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the beginning (base year) and/or the end (latest inventory year) of the time series, and reviewed and time-series-consistent values are available for most years of the time series. 45. Extrapolation of inventory parameters (e.g. activity data): in addition to applying extrapolation methods to emission or removal estimates it may be necessary to use extrapolation at the level of activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). 46. Extrapolation of emissions or removals using drivers or surrogate data can be applied if inventory estimates are available for some years (at a minimum for all years but two) of the time series but are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the required year (base year and/or latest inventory year). The emissions or removals need to be strongly correlated with other well-known and more readily available indicative data (drivers). 47. Interpolation is applicable for calculating an adjustment for a given inventory year provided that reviewed values of the adjacent years are available. This method would most likely be applied in exceptional cases only, but could be applicable to activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances. 3. Adjustment methods based on correlation of emissions/removals between categories or gases 48. Correlation of emissions or removals between categories or gases within an inventory could in some cases be used to estimate emissions or removals of a specific gas or from a specific category. For example, CH, and N,O emissions from fuel combustion activities could be calculated from CO, emissions, if available. 4. Adjustment methods based on clustering of countries 49. Application of average inventory parameters from a cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances for the sector in question could be used to correct any inventory parameter (e.g. emission factor) that was found not to be in accordance with [IPCC good practice guidance, or as input to the IPCC tier 1 method. The inventory review resources listed in appendix I provide recommended approaches and tools for clustering inventory data. If an adjustment has to be made for a given country, expert review teams should assign the Party in question to the cluster of countries to which it would most likely belong according to its national circumstances. 50. Application of an average driver-based emission/removal rate from a cluster of countries can be used if an emission or removal estimate is missing entirely or was not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance, but data for a parameter driving the emissions or removals from that source or sink are available for the country in question. The estimate is derived by establishing a relationship between emissions/removals and an appropriate driver for the cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances, and applying this relationship to the Party in question. If data for the driver are not available for the year in question, the driver should be extrapolated as described in paragraph 46 above. D. Conservative approach 51. The choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that emission estimates for the base year are not overestimated, and that emission estimates for a year of the commitment period are not underestimated relative to the likely true value of the emissions of the Party concerned. 52. Similarly, the choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that removal estimates for the base year are not underestimated, and that removal estimates for a year of the commitment period are not overestimated relative to the likely true value of the removals of the Party concerned. 53. As a principle to achieve conservative estimates, the calculation of an adjustment for a commitment period year should not result in an emission estimate that is lower or a removal estimate that is higher than that originally submitted by the Party, and an adjustment for an estimate of the base year should not result in an emission estimate that is higher or a removal estimate that is lower than the originally submitted estimate. 54. To ensure conservativeness for the purpose of adjustments, a conservativeness factor should be applied to the specific component of the estimation method used by the Party or to the emission/removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A of this technical guidance. For illustration purposes, this approach may be expressed as: M x CF = Adjusted estimate Where M is the component of an estimation method used by a Party, or the emission or removal estimate generated by a basic adjustment method in this technical guidance, and CF is the conservativeness factor. 55. The conservativeness factor should be selected from the tables of conservativeness factors provided in appendix III to this technical guidance. In the case that the tables do not provide a conservativeness factor for a given source/sink category, a conservativeness factor for a category with similar characteristics should be used. 56. For cases where only one component of an estimation method used by a Party is replaced, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to that component, in accordance with paragraph 22 above. In other cases, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to the emission or removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment method, in accordance with paragraph 24 above. 57. If, exceptionally, an expert review team considers that, in its expert judgement, the estimate generated by applying the basic approach referred to in paragraph 54 above is not conservative or is overly conservative for the Party concerned,'' the expert review team may use an alternative approach for applying conservativeness, and, where applicable, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 22 and 28 above. The expert review team shall justify and document the technical reason for its decision, and for its choice of the alternative approach used, and include this information in the review report. IV. Sector-specific elements 58. When calculating adjustments, expert review teams should follow the provisions of chapter I11 taking into account the sector-specific elements given below, as appropriate. The provisions of this chapter apply to the calculation of the adjustments before applying the conservativeness factor described in section II1.D above. A. Fuel combustion 59. When adjusting CO, emissions from one or several disaggregated IPCC source categories, care should be taken that total CO, emissions are in accordance with the total fuel consumption, which is generally better known than the fuel consumption in each of the disaggregated IPCC source categories. 60. In the event that total CO, emissions from fuel combustion need to be adjusted, the reference approach is the preferred option for calculating an adjustment. Reference approach estimates should preferably be taken from the Party. If this is not considered appropriate, emission estimates from the IEA can be used. 61. If an N,O emission factor from road transport needs to be replaced, increased use of catalytic converters leading to increased emission factors should be taken into account when calculating an adjustment. B. Industrial processes 62. The expert review team should consider the possibility of double counting (for instance, the use of lime in iron and steel production) and avoid any double counting through the application of adjustments. 63. If adjusting hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), perfluorocarbon (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SFg) estimates from the consumption of halocarbons and SFg, consideration should be given to the uncertainty of sales figures (e.g. for sales of these chemicals to the foam blowing industry) and other parameters (such as the composition of the mix in coolants) as given in the IPCC good practice guidance. "" That is, the expert review team believes that the likely true value of the emissions or removals from a source/sink for a year of the commitment period is higher or much lower than the adjusted estimate generated, or the true value of the emissions from a source in the base year is lower or much higher than the adjusted estimate generated, taking into account any guidance from lead reviewers on this matter. C. Agriculture 64. When adjusting emissions from agricultural soils, preference should be given to tier 1.a methods as provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. 65. The expert review team should note that when adjusting emissions from manure management systems, savannah burning, or field burning of agricultural residues, the same activity data should be used for CHy4 as for N,O. 66. Similarly, consistent livestock data should be used for CH4and N,O emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management, and for N,O emissions from animal manure applied to soils. D. Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) 67. When using data from a cluster of countries, data should be selected on the basis of the similarity of these countries in relation to: National circumstances such as climatic conditions, vegetation types, management regimes, national policies and others Choices in relation to definitions, data acquisition methods, and reporting of carbon pools'? and of activities in accordance with decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7. (a) (b) 68. Adjustments should not be applied in the case that a Party has not reported a category contained in appendices to chapter 3 of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry unless it was previously included in the inventory. 69. Estimates of emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector and from LULUCEF activities may be based not on annual data but on extrapolations and may be recalculated at a later stage. For this reason, the application of an adjustment to the base year of cropland management, grazing land management or revegetation through an extrapolation should be done with care, given that data may not be reported for the years between the base year and the commitment period. If an extrapolation is needed for the base year of these activities, the expert review team could use as a driver the time series for the LULUCF sector included in the annual inventory submission under the Convention. 70. When expert review teams are choosing a basic adjustment method from table 1 for the LULUCF sector, they should carefully assess whether the IPCC tier 1 methods are indeed the most appropriate methods to derive a conservative estimate. E. Waste 71. Data on populations and/or urban populations, and GDP per capita, could be used in some cases to estimate the volume of solid waste, taking into account national circumstances. Urban population and protein consumption data could be used to obtain activity data to estimate emissions from domestic waste-water handling. Production data associated with the main industries in a specific country could be used as a possible driver to estimate the amount of industrial waste water, taking into account differences in technologies (e.g. emission per unit production). If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. 72. For activity data, a cluster of countries based mainly on waste management practices could be used for estimating certain types of data, such as the waste generation rate, but not for estimating other types of data, such as the amount of waste incinerated or the amount of waste deposited, because these data largely depend on national environmental waste management policies. 73. When adjusting emissions from waste incineration, the applicability of drivers is very limited. 74. When adjusting emissions from solid waste disposal sites or waste-water treatment, the recovery of the methane needs to be considered. For solid waste disposal the expert review team should also take into account that if activity data are constant or increasing and the country used the IPCC tier 1 default method, this will have resulted in a conservative emission estimate. 73 APPENDIX I List of inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments This appendix lists inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments using the adjustment methods and approaches described in the technical guidance. The information contained in the inventory review resources listed here will be maintained by the UNFCCC secretariat and made available to expert review teams by electronic means.

If adjustments are still needed, the expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with this technical guidance, in consultation with the Party concerned, and shall prepare a individual inventory review report which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates and related information, within eight weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed, and shall send the report to the Party concerned. 4. The Annex I Party shall be provided with four weeks to comment on the individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether, and for what reasons, it accepts or rejects the adjustment. If the Party concerned disagrees with the proposed adjustment(s) the expert review team should send the notification from the Party, along with the recommendation of the expert review team, in its final report to the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. II. Reporting 5.

This appendix provides two sets of tables of conservativeness factors to be used in the calculation of adjustments to ensure that adjusted estimates are conservative, in accordance with paragraphs 51 and 52 of the technical guidance. The first set of tables (tables 1 and 2) covers conservativeness factors for sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol. The second set of tables (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a and 4.b) covers conservativeness factors for emissions and removals from LULUCF. For both sets of tables, these conservativeness factors are provided in two parts: For Annex A sources, one for use in the calculation of adjustments for a base year estimate and one for the calculation of adjustments for a year of the commitment period For estimates of emissions and removals from LULUCF, separate factors are provided for emissions and removals, for use in the calculation of adjustments to the LULUCEF sector during the initial review for the purpose of establishing a Party’s assigned amount (tables 3.a and 3.b), and for use in the calculation of adjustments of activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4 (tables 4.a and 4.b). (a) (b) 2. In all tables, conservativeness factors are provided for emission factors or other estimation parameters, activity data, and emission or removal estimates for each IPCC category and Article 3, paragraph 3 and 4 activity, and corresponding gas. 3. When a given category is not covered in the table, the provision of paragraph 55 of the technical guidance applies, such as for categories “other” under industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, waste and the IPCC sector “7 Other”. 4. The conservativeness factors in these tables will be updated, as required, following the collective recommendation of lead reviewers, subject to approval by the SBSTA. Application of conservativeness factors to estimates from LULUCF (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, 4.b) 5. According to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the technical guidance, adjustments should be applied at the lowest level possible at which the problem is identified. Therefore, there might be a need to apply adjustments to individual components (e.g. emission factors, inventory parameters or activity data) as well as to estimates of carbon stock changes from individual carbon pools. 6. To ensure that the selection of the conservativeness factors from the tables of conservativeness factors for LULUCEF contributes to a conservative adjustment in line with paragraph 53 of the guidance, the expert review team should determine whether the individual component or the carbon stock change from the individual pool subject to adjustment leads to an increase of either emissions or removals, and choose the conservativeness factor accordingly from the respective tables, taking into account the year to which the adjustment is applied (base year or year of the commitment period, as appropriate). For any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing emissions, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.a, 4.a or 4.b as appropriate; for any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing removals, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.b, 4.a or 4.b, as appropriate. Background information on the preparation of the tables of conservativeness factors 7. The conservativeness factors are derived from uncertainty values and parameters provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, and in some cases are determined by expert judgement for the purpose of this technical guidance, as indicated below: (a) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for a component, this range for that component is used; (a) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for emissions or removals from a particular category or a combined uncertainty range can be calculated from the uncertainty values and/or ranges of the input parameters using the tier 1 method, the range generated by applying the uncertainty value for the category is used; In cases where the IPCC good practice guidance does not provide an uncertainty range for an estimate or a combined uncertainty range cannot be calculated because necessary information is not available, an assessed uncertainty range determined by expert judgement for the purposes of this technical guidance is used. (b) (©) 8. Different conservativeness factors are provided for use in adjustments to estimate for a base year and for a year of the commitment period. The conservativeness factors are calculated using the 25"" or 75™ percentile of the range generated by an uncertainty value for the gas and category, as appropriate, for use in an adjustment for the base year, or a year of the commitment period, assuming a log—normal distribution. 9. The uncertainty values have been grouped into five sets of uncertainty bands, with corresponding conservativeness factors, by assigning a given uncertainty value to a given band. These bands relate to the underlying uncertainties, as follows: Conservativeness factors for emissions in the base year Conservativeness factor for emissions in a year of the Estimated uncertainty Assigned and/or removals in a commitment period range uncertainty band year of the and/or removals in the (%) (%) commitment period base year Less than or equal to 10 7 0.98 1.02 Greater than 10 and less than 20 0.94 1.06 or equal to 30 Greater than 30 and less than 40 0.89 1.12 or equal to 50 Greater than 50 and less than 75 0.82 1.21 or equal to 100 Greater than 100 150 0.73 1.37 40 1.21 75 Table 1 Conservativeness factors for adjustments in the base year (for sources in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol) Emission factors l.Energy | [ ] ] [ A ol combusion (et pprone) ||| 1.

A/C.3/61/L.27 in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing countries, Stressing the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that every five seconds a child under the age of 5 dies from hunger or hunger-related diseases somewhere in the world, that there are about 854 million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 5. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 6. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 7. Encourages all States to take steps with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger; 8. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; A/C.3/61/L.27 9. Stresses also the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands; and in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 10. Acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 11. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 12. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 13. Recognizes the need for a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round negotiations of the World Trade Organization, as a contribution for creating international conditions that permit the realization of the right to food; 14. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 15. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites once again all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security’ and the United Nations Millennium Declaration;’ 16. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 17. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, A/C.3/61/L.27 while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 19. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently occurring across Africa; 20. [Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 21. Takes note of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food,® and also takes note of his valuable work in the promotion of the right to food; 22. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as extended by the Human Rights Council in its decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006;° 23. Requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 24. Welcomes the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its General Comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),!® in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and the international levels, oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all; 25. Recalls General Comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant),!! in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture in realization of the right to adequate food; 26. Reaffirms that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, represent a practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the achievement of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration; 9 Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-first Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/61/53), part one, chap.
