deeply concerned over the lack of progress on the issue of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict in particular against women and children, notably against girls, and noting as documented in the Secretary-General’s report that sexual violence occurs in armed conflicts throughout the world, Reiterating deep concern that, despite its repeated condemnation of violence against women and children including all forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, and despite its calls addressed to all parties to armed conflict for the cessation of such acts with immediate effect, such acts continue to occur, and in some situations have become systematic or widespread, Recalling the commitments of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (A/52/231) as well as those contained in the outcome document of the twenty-third Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly entitled “Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the Twenty-First Century”

and special protection due to the fact that they can be placed particularly at risk, Recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other egregious crimes perpetrated against civilians, and in this regard, noting with concern that only limited numbers of perpetrators of sexual violence have been brought to justice, while recognizing that in conflict and in post conflict situations national justice systems may be significantly weakened, Reaffirming that ending impunity is essential if a society in conflict or recovering from conflict is to come to terms with past abuses committed against civilians affected by armed conflict and to prevent future such abuses, drawing attention to the full range of justice and reconciliation mechanisms to be considered, including national, international and “mixed” criminal courts and tribunals and truth and reconciliation commissions, and noting that such mechanisms can promote not only individual responsibility for serious crimes, but also peace, truth, reconciliation and the rights of the victims, Recalling the inclusion of a range of sexual violence offences in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the statutes of the ad hoc international criminal tribunals, Stressing the necessity for all States and non-State parties to conflicts to comply fully with their obligations under applicable international law, including the prohibition on all forms of sexual violence, Recognizing the need for civilian and military leaders, consistent with the principle of command responsibility, to demonstrate commitment and political will to prevent sexual violence and to combat impunity and enforce accountability,

forces, thereby helping to build a security sector that is accessible and responsive to all, especially women, Welcoming the efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop gender guidelines for military personnel in peacekeeping operations to facilitate the implementation of resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), and operational guidance to assist civilian, military and police components of peacekeeping missions to effectively implement resolution 1820 (2008), Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 16 July 2009 (S/2009/362) and stressing that the present resolution does not seek to make any legal determination as to whether situations that are referred to in the Secretary- General’s report are or are not armed conflicts within the context of

widespread impact of armed conflict on civilians, including with regard to sexual violence, 1.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 24. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 25. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance, both as an effective contribution to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs, as well as to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 26.

Mahiga Ambassador Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania to the United Nations A/64/233 Annex I Explanatory memorandum 1. The relevance and magnitude of international migration and the growing awareness of its importance in the economic, social, cultural or humanitarian debates within the United Nations framework led to the granting of observer status to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) by the General Assembly in 1992 (resolution 47/4), to the inclusion of IOM by the Assembly as a “standing invitee” in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee for the coordination of humanitarian assistance the same year, and to the signature of the Cooperation Agreement between the United Nations and IOM in 1996. The Assembly, in its resolution 51/148 of 13 December 1996 on cooperation between the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration, took note with satisfaction of the conclusion of the Agreement; invited the Secretary-General to ensure that the needed cooperation and liaison between the secretariats of the two organizations was undertaken in order to ensure complementary actions; requested the Secretary- General, in consultation with the Director-General of IOM, to foster systematic consultations; and invited the specialized agencies and other organizations, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to cooperate with the Secretary- General and the Director-General of IOM in order to initiate, maintain and increase consultation and programmes with IOM. 2. In resolution 51/148, however, the General Assembly did not establish a systematic and periodic reporting on IOM/United Nations cooperation, a practice in place for several other non-United Nations organizations. The initiative presented in the present explanatory memorandum is meant to fill this gap without adding to the number of reports submitted to the Assembly, as the reports on cooperation with non-United Nations organizations are consolidated into one report. 3. Since the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement, in fact, the level and range of cooperation between the United Nations system and IOM has increased and diversified, covering both policy and operational levels. Similarly, over the last 12 years, States and other stakeholders have become increasingly aware of the challenges and opportunities presented by international migration. For these reasons, the establishment of a United Nations/IOM reporting mechanism would be useful, timely and constructive. 4. The collaboration of IOM with the United Nations system and its agencies has been further strengthened by the conclusion of memorandums of understanding with several departments, funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and, inter alia, by the membership in the Global Migration Group, a 14-member inter-agency group, meeting at the level of heads of agencies, which aims to promote the wider application of all relevant international and regional instruments and norms relating to migration, and the provision of more coherent and stronger leadership to improve policy and operational responses. This increasing operational collaboration that has evolved over the past decade and a half between IOM and a broadening range of United Nations entities has resulted in more frequent ad hoc inclusion of IOM in relevant United Nations processes. This has especially been the case in emergency and/or post-conflict rehabilitation situations, but also extends to a number of development-oriented initiatives and partnerships. A/64/233 5. A score of non-United Nations organizations which have been granted the status of Permanent Observer to the United Nations are part of periodic reporting arrangements in the General Assembly. The areas of cooperation between those reporting organizations and the United Nations system are outlined and described in biennial consolidated reports prepared and submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary-General under the title “Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations”. 6. The resolution in annex II contemplates the establishment of a biennial IOM/United Nations reporting mechanism as part of the above-mentioned report, which would recognize the increasing cooperation that already exists between the two organizations while in no way changing the nature of the current institutional relationship. 7. In the light of the above, it would be of particular importance if the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to include in his report on cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations a section on cooperation between the United Nations and IOM. Considering the biennialization of the work of the Assembly and the fact that the next report of the Secretary-General will be submitted at the sixty-fifth session of the Assembly, it would be timely that the resolution in annex II be adopted at the sixty-fourth session of the Assembly. A/64/233 Annex IT Draft resolution Cooperation between the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 47/4 of 16 October 1992, by which it granted observer status to the International Organization for Migration and invited that organization to participate in its sessions and work, as well as its resolution 51/148 of 13 December 1996 on cooperation between the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration, Noting the desire of both organizations to consolidate and enhance the cooperation existing between them in the economic, social, humanitarian and administrative fields, Convinced that the further strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations system and the International Organization for Migration contributes to the promotion of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, 1. Encourages both the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration to strengthen the cooperation that already exists between the two organizations and further collaborate in matters of common interest; 2.
