collecting, processing and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, have increased significantly in the digital age, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and

right to privacy, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal

to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Emphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect personal data and when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including private companies, Recognizing the global and open nature of the Internet as a driving force in accelerating progress towards development in its various forms, including in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals,"" Noting that general comment No. 16 on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recommends that States take effective measures to prevent the unlawful

personal data can pose a risk to the enjoyment of the right to privacy in the digital age, Welcoming measures taken by business enterprises, on a voluntary basis, to provide transparency to their users about their policies regarding requests by State authorities for access to user data and information, Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights and that

collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities, Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, "" See resolution 70/1.
