Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens’ entitlement to public information. Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data. Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics. Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents. Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes. Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be made public. Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system. Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries. 2 For the original preamble used on the occasion of the initial adoption of the Principles in 1994, see the report of the Statistical Commission on its special session (E/1994/29), chapter V.

This war, unprecedented by its scale and ferocity, turned into a great tragedy for the peoples of Europe, Asia and the world. A threat to the very basic principles of civilization was averted at the cost of colossal joint efforts and grave losses. Through the suffering and death of millions of people, the world community came to realize the indispensability of a system of collective security and the necessity of establishing reliable machinery to ensure international peace. The burning desire to spare humanity forever from the miseries of war inspired States to adopt a reliable mechanism for maintaining international peace and security: the United Nations. The objectives set for the Organization when it was established are still relevant. Among them are strengthening of an equitable world order based on the principles of humanism and mutually beneficial cooperation, effective maintenance of international peace and security, and promotion of sustained development in the political, socioeconomic and other spheres. Today we need to remember the lessons of the Second World War and to work to promote the preservation of the historical memory of peoples. The perception of the victory won in 1945 as a common value for all of humanity is essential for the consolidation of the international community to address dangerous modern challenges and threats. The memory of the victory over fascism is also relevant in terms of preventing attempts to revise the results of the Second World War and the conclusions of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as well as in light of the objectives of the United Nations to oppose crimes based on race, nationality and ethnic origin and the spread of ideas of intolerance and related contemporary forms of racial discrimination. It is in the direct interest of humanity to further strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as the central element in the collective security system designed to put into practice the high goal proclaimed in the United Nations Charter: “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Consideration of this agenda item could lead to the adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution on the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. This would make it possible to hold a special solemn meeting of the Assembly in memory of all victims of the war. 3/4 A/69/191 Annex II Draft resolution on the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 59/26 of 22 November 2004, in which it, inter alia, declared 8-9 May as a time of remembrance and reconciliation, while recognizing that Member States may have individual dates of victory, liberation and commemoration, Recalling that 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a war which brought untold sorrow to mankind, particularly in Asia and Europe, Stressing that this historic event established the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, Calling upon the States Members of the United Nations to unite their efforts in dealing with new challenges and threats, with the United Nations playing a central role, and to make every effort to settle all disputes by peaceful means in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered, Underlining the progress made since the end of the Second World War in overcoming its legacy and towards reconciliation, international and regional cooperation and the promotion of democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular through the United Nations, and the establishment of regional organizations and other appropriate frameworks, 1.

In accordance with rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, an explanatory memorandum (see annex J)",N/A,The Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation also has the honour to request that the present letter and its annexes be circulated as a document of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly.,"14-59310* (E) 200814 CA YA A A/69/192 Annex I [Original: English] Explanatory memorandum The Outer Space Treaty (1967) recognizes that the use and exploration of outer space for peaceful purposes is in the common interest of mankind. The Treaty establishes that space activities must be developed in conformity with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, aiming at the maintenance of international peace and security and the promotion of cooperation and mutual understanding. While the Outer Space Treaty prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in outer space, the Treaty alone is not sufficient to fully regulate the issue, since it does not explicitly cover either conventional weapons or new technological advances. Bearing in mind the wide range of possibilities offered by the use of outer space for the promotion of international social and economic development, there is, therefore, a legitimate concern with the possible placement of weapons in outer space. The prevention of an arms race in outer space has been on the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament since 1985. In this regard, China and the Russian Federation jointly introduced in 2008 a proposal on a treaty for the consideration by the States members of the Conference on Disarmament (prohibition on the placement of weapons in outer space). In the traditional preambular paragraphs of resolutions on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, the General Assembly has recognized that negotiations for the conclusion of an international agreement or agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space remain a priority task of the Conference on Disarmament and makes a special reference to “the introduction by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference” of the treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space. On 10 June 2014, an updated version of the treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space was submitted, reflecting proposals made by interested States, thus giving an additional impulse to further work on that treaty. Taking into account the stalemate that hampers progress on the adoption of a programme of work of the Conference on Disarmament, the issue remains unresolved. On 5 October 2004, the Russian Federation, in its statement to the First Committee of the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, pledged that it would not be the first to place weapons of any kind in outer space and called upon all States to follow suit. Since 2005, Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Brazil, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan have formally adhered to a “no first placement” policy. 2/5 A/69/192 General Assembly resolution 68/50 on transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space activities and the final report of the relevant group of governmental experts, both of which were adopted by consensus, take note of the efforts made by those States that are pursuing the “no first placement” policy. We believe that the broadest possible international adherence to this policy will greatly contribute to strengthening international peace and security. Thus, understanding the urgency of further effective steps in this regard, we propose a resolution entitled “No first placement of weapons in outer space” for consideration of the First Committee. We believe that adoption of a resolution on “No first placement of weapons in outer space” would contribute to the globalization of the “no first placement” initiative, making it a truly universal political commitment. The initiative itself could be seen as an interim step on the road to a legally binding instrument that would promote the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes and strengthen security and predictability of outer space activities by preventing placement of weapons of any kind in outer space. 3/5 A/69/192 Annex II [Original: English] Draft resolution No first placement of weapons in outer space The General Assembly, Recognizing the common interest of all mankind in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, Seriously concerned about the possibility of an arms race in outer space, and bearing in mind the importance of articles III and IV of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies of 27 January 1967, Conscious that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave danger to international peace and security, Reaffirming that further measures should be examined in the search for agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space, Also reaffirming its recognition that the legal regime applicable to outer space by itself does not guarantee prevention of an arms race in outer space and that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce that regime, Noting, in this regard, the treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, introduced by the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament, ! Considering that transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space activities are an integral part of the treaty mentioned, Recalling its previous resolutions, including resolutions 45/55B_ of 4 December 1990 and 48/74B of 16 December 1993, which, inter alia, confirm the importance of transparency and confidence-building measures as a means conducive to ensuring the attainment of the objective of the prevention of an arms race in outer space, Noting the importance of political statements made by a number of States not to be the first to place weapons in outer space,? 1. Reaffirms the importance and urgency of the objective to prevent an arms race in outer space and the willingness of States to contribute to reaching this common goal; 2.

safeguards, effective oversight and remedies, with a view to further practical guidance, grounded in international human rights law, on the principles of necessity, proportionality and legitimacy,

effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology will require an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Noting also that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communication technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments,

arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, including data about communications, known as metadata, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, especially when undertaken on a mass scale, Noting that while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory and that any interference with the right to privacy must be necessary and proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims and not impair the essence of the right, Noting that
