Historical background 1. The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) was established at the initiative of the Republic of Korea, with a vision of shifting the current development paradigm of quantity-oriented, fossil-fuel-dependent growth to quality-oriented and sustainable economic growth. In the new paradigm, green economy and green growth are dynamic tools to achieve sustainable development, addressing the economic, environmental and social pillars in a balanced way and with a strong focus on implementation. The Institute originated as an amalgamation of ideas from the public and private sectors committed to helping developing countries on the transition towards a low-carbon, inclusive and sustainable economic growth path. 2. The Institute was initially formed as a non-profit foundation under the domestic laws of the Republic of Korea in May 2010 and became an international organization when the Agreement on the Establishment of the Global Green Growth Institute was signed in June 2012 and entered into force in October 2012. 3. Membership in the Institute is, in accordance with article 5 of the Agreement, open to any Member State of the United Nations as well as to regional integration organizations. 4. As of June 2013, the Institute had 20 member States. The Institute is headquartered in Seoul and has branch offices in Copenhagen, Abu Dhabi and London. IJ. The instrument establishing the Global Green Growth Institute 5. The Agreement that established the Global Green Growth Institute was signed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 20 June 2012 by the Commonwealth of Australia, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of Costa Rica, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, the Republic of Kiribati, the Kingdom of Norway, the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Paraguay, the State of Qatar, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 6. The Agreement was also subsequently signed by the Republic of the Philippines, on 21 June 2012, the Republic of Indonesia, on 17 September 2012, the United Mexican States, on 12 October 2012, and Mongolia and the Republic of Rwanda, on 9 June 2013. The Agreement entered into force on 18 October 2012. III. Members 7. Currently, the following 20 countries are the member States of the Global Green Growth Institute: 3/10 A/68/191 Australia Cambodia Costa Rica Denmark Ethiopia Guyana Indonesia Kiribati Mexico Mongolia Norway Papua New Guinea Paraguay Philippines Qatar Republic of Korea Rwanda United Arab Emirates United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Viet Nam IV. Purpose and function 8. Pursuant to article 2 of the Agreement, “[t]he GGGI shall promote sustainable development of developing and emerging countries, including the least developed countries, by: (a) supporting and diffusing a new paradigm of economic growth: green growth, which is a balanced advance of economic growth and environmental sustainability; (b) targeting key aspects of economic performance and resilience, poverty reduction, job creation and social inclusion, and those of environmental sustainability such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and securing access to affordable, clean energy, clean water and land; and (c) creating and improving the economic, environmental and social conditions of developing and emerging countries through partnerships between developed and developing countries and the public and private sectors.” 9. The Institute supports developing countries that seek to leapfrog the resource- intensive and environmentally unsustainable model of economic development pioneered in an earlier era by industrialized economies, by providing them with tailored and sustained programmes of technical and capacity-building assistance. In this way, the Institute assists developing countries in pursuing the green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, as an important tool for achieving sustainable development. 10. The Institute’s core activity is green growth planning and implementation, through which it provides expert technical assistance and capacity-building to developing countries and emerging economies. Currently, the Institute has green growth planning and implementation programmes in 18 developing countries, as well as 3 multi-country programmes. Through these programmes, the Institute supports developing countries and emerging economies in their development of green and inclusive economic development strategies, and their implementation of these strategies, including through financial analysis and public-private cooperation. 4/10 A/68/191 11. The Institute provides the best available analytical tools and helps build institutional capacity to apply them, through a tailored, consistent programme for partner countries based on specific national circumstances and_ priorities. Programmes are implemented in close cooperation with partner countries, including national, provincial and municipal authorities. The Institute maintains a presence on the ground to facilitate capacity-building and ensure full country ownership. 12. The Institute initiates its cooperation programmes on the basis of a high-level request from a developing country Government. The Institute’s approach is particularly suited to developing countries because its point of departure is inclusive and green economic growth, leading to broad-based progress in living standards and quality of life. 13. The scope of work for the Institute in a developing country depends on the country’s specific situation and development goals. Initially, and in close collaboration with the Government, the Institute conducts a comprehensive diagnosis of the country’s green growth potential and its internal and external challenges. The diagnosis involves assessing physical and socioeconomic conditions as well as the potential for aligning an inclusive green economy approach with the country’s development priorities. The next step establishes a green growth pathway, refines the policy options available and identifies the options for implementation, in particular financing and public-private cooperation. This includes actions in priority sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, water, transport and energy, according to the partner country’s specific circumstances and priorities. 14. Currently, the Institute cooperates with the following countries and provinces (in alphabetical order): (a) Africa: the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Republic of Rwanda and the Republic of South Africa; (b) Asia: the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of Indonesia, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Karnataka (Republic of India), the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Republic of the Philippines, the Kingdom of Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and Yunnan Province (in the People’s Republic of China); (c) Latin America and the Caribbean: the Federative Republic of Brazil, the United Mexican States and the Republic of Peru. 15. In addition, the Institute has multi-country programmes in the Amazon, Aral Sea and Mekong regions. A programme among small island developing States is under preparation. 16. In the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Institute supported the Government in establishing institutional and legal frameworks and elaborating a national green growth policy and strategy. The strategy identifies a number of specific actions, and currently the Institute is looking into how best to support their implementation. 17. In the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Institute supported the Government in developing a climate-resilient green economy plan. This included national strategies on climate resilience and green economy (low-carbon development), underpinned by scientific and economic analysis. Currently, the Institute is supporting the Government in implementing the green economy plan, including setting concrete targets across different sectors and regions and assessing 5/10 A/68/191 the policies required, taking into account barriers to implementation, to meet these targets. 18. In the People’s Republic of China, the Institute plans to assist Yunnan Province in pursuing green growth by developing a five-year green growth action plan in line with the national and provincial development plans. The Institute also focuses on selected sectoral projects and provides training to key stakeholders in order to build local capacity in green growth planning and implementation. 19. In the United Mexican States, the Institute and the Government have designed a jointly funded programme of collaboration that supports the federal Government in developing a climate-resilience plan aimed at reducing economic vulnerability, especially among the poorest populations. It is also developing proposals for public- private cooperation and creating South-South dialogue and knowledge transfer. 20. The Institute’s two other programmes — research and _ public-private cooperation — are designed to support the delivery of the green growth planning and implementation programmes, in particular the quality of the analytical and implementation support provided to the Governments of developing countries. This includes South-South and North-South knowledge-sharing. 21. The Institute’s research programme analyses the development of the green growth paradigm in developing countries by conducting research on green growth theory and practice. The focus is on areas where there is the greatest need for additional research, identified jointly with senior policymakers (e.g., chief economic advisers and finance, economy and planning ministries) and leading economists in developing and emerging countries. The main outcome is relevant, high-quality research that explores the potential of inclusive green growth and provides practical guidance to policymakers, especially in developing and emerging countries. 22. The research programme prioritizes the following topic areas as they apply to developing and emerging countries: green growth planning tools and methodology; lessons from in-country green growth planning experience; economic theory and policy of green growth; resource efficiency and green growth, including sectoral opportunities and approaches; technological innovation and green growth; employment and poverty reduction; social innovation and welfare; the political economy of green growth; and international economic cooperation and green growth. 23. Some of the Institute’s research is generated primarily by in-house researchers and draws heavily on the Institute’s green growth planning and implementation experience in developing and emerging countries. Other research is conducted in partnership with leading economic policy institutes and research centres in both developing and advanced countries, especially on more theoretical and technology- focused issues. 24. Among the initiatives carried out under the research programme which may provide useful inputs to United Nations processes are the Green Growth Knowledge Platform and the Green Growth Best Practices. In the Green Growth Knowledge Platform, the Institute cooperates with the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to create a global network of researchers and development experts with the aim of identifying and addressing major knowledge gaps in green economy and green growth theory and practice. The Platform provides policymakers 6/10 A/68/191 with the tools to facilitate the transition, and identifies and addresses major knowledge gaps in green economy theory and practice, in order to help countries design and implement policies to move towards a green economy. 25. The Green Growth Best Practices initiative conducts fact-based analysis of green growth best practices with a team of expert authors from all regions. The assessment results are documented and shared through handbooks, policy briefs, training materials, a website and other audience-tailored resources, as well as through policy dialogue workshops, outreach to countries, webinars and other learning forums. In this initiative, the Institute cooperates with the Climate and Development Knowledge Network and the European Climate Foundation. 26. The Institute’s public-private cooperation programme facilitates the engagement of the resources and expertise of the private sector, both domestically and internationally, in the implementation of green growth strategies in the Institute’s partner countries. 27. Through this programme, the Institute facilitates public-private cooperation by linking companies to developing country Governments that are seeking private sector finance, technology and expertise to accelerate the implementation of their green growth or green economy plans. The Institute connects the partner countries with potential private sector providers of capital and technology by developing specific investment plans in key sectors that help tap domestic and external, as well as public and private, sources of finance. 28. In addition, the public-private cooperation programme builds intra- and cross- industry programmes of cooperation, and links them to relevant intergovernmental processes, to expand markets in developing and emerging countries for resource- efficient products, services and industrial processes, and to facilitate technology transfer. The programme elevates the importance that political and business leaders attach to the role of public-private cooperation for implementation. 29. As part of the public-private cooperation programme, the Institute acts as a strategic partner of the Global Green Growth Forum, which is a_ high-level partnership of three developed countries (the Kingdom of Denmark, the Republic of Korea and the State of Qatar) and three developing countries (the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Kenya and the United Mexican States) that seeks to support the innovation and scaling-up of private sector engagement in various aspects of green growth. 30. In June 2013, in recognition of the sustainable benefits that the Institute has brought and will be able to bring to developing and emerging countries, the OECD Development Assistance Committee Working Party on Development Finance Statistics approved the addition of the Institute to the list of international organizations eligible for official development assistance. V. Governance bodies 31. The Institute’s governance structure consists of the Assembly, the Council and the Secretariat, whose functions are as follows: (a) The Assembly is composed of the members of the Institute and meets every two years. The functions of the Assembly include advising on the overall 7/10 A/68/191 direction of the Institute and reviewing the organization’s progress in meeting its stated objectives. The Assembly also elects Council members and appoints a Director General; (b) The Council serves as the executive organ of the Institute and thus approves the organization’s strategy, budget, admission of new members and criteria for its programmes; (c) The Secretariat acts as the chief operational organ of the organization and is headed by the Director General, who represents the Institute externally and provides strategic leadership for the organization in carrying out its objectives. VI. Observer status in the United Nations General Assembly 32. The Institute is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations process on sustainable development and the attainment of internationally agreed development goals. 33. The Institute and its members adhere fully to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. 34. As a new international organization with a focus on developing countries, the Institute contributes in a concrete way towards the objectives and frameworks established by the United Nations and other international bodies in the areas of sustainable development and poverty reduction, including Agenda 21; the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy; the Istanbul Programme of Action; the internationally agreed commitments related to Africa’s development needs; the Millennium Development Goals; the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation; and the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want” (General Assembly resolution 66/288, annex). 35. Consistent with, and in active support of, these United Nations frameworks, the Institute cooperates with developing countries and emerging economies to facilitate and implement the transition towards a green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, as defined and detailed in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. 36. Through its programmes, the Institute helps developing countries and emerging economies to achieve sustainable development through green economy policies, to integrate the green economy potential into their national development strategies and investment plans, and to mobilize national and international resources. 37. Developing countries sometimes lack the expertise to build “bankable” investment cases, leading to difficulties in attracting finance. The Institute helps fill this gap through its familiarity with the country’s green growth plan, the strategic relationship it builds with the Government in helping to design their plans, and its neutrality in the sense of not being a financing agency or bilateral cooperation partner. 38. Cooperation with the Institute makes partner countries ready to benefit from international funding sources which support investments in a green economy, including the Green Climate Fund and other climate financing mechanisms. 8/10 A/68/191 39. Granting the Institute observer status in the General Assembly would enable the Institute to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes, based on real-life experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. 40. The Institute can contribute valuable and innovative analytical inputs and knowledge to the United Nations by providing: (a) Best practice experience and tools for the implementation of green economy policies and legislation; (b) Macroeconomic and cross-sectoral analysis on the green economy, including impacts on poverty alleviation and productive employment; (c) Analysis of financial options, investment flows and market-based mechanisms, such as payment of ecosystem services; (d) Analysis on the green economy potential of key areas, such as energy, water, oceans and seas, agriculture, forestry, transport, tourism, urban development, and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and on cross-sectoral interlinkages, such as the water-food-energy nexus; (e) Models for involving businesses and industry in the green economy, including small and medium-sized enterprises, e.g., through public-private partnerships, innovation and technology transfer; and (f) Indicators for measuring progress towards a green economy. 9/10 A/68/191 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the Global Green Growth Institute in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Wishing to promote cooperation between the United Nations and the Global Green Growth Institute, 1.
