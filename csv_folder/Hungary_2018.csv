in the digital age held during the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communications technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of Governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age may affect all individuals, including with particular effects on women, as well as children, persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, Recognizing that the promotion of and respect for the right to privacy are linked to the prevention of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, which occurs in digital and online spaces and includes cyberbullying and cyberstalking, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the

17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, !* while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption and the need to discuss the right to privacy in view of the challenges of the digital age, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, based on international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies, the impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, § Resolution 70/125. 2 Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-third Session, Supplement No. 40 (A/43/40),

the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology requires an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Affirming that this engagement is greatly facilitated by informal dialogues about the right to privacy among all relevant stakeholders, Emphasizing that the protection and promotion of, and respect for, the right to privacy require the sustained engagement of all stakeholders, including governments, industry, civil society and international organizations, Recognizing that the discussion on the right to privacy should be based upon existing international and domestic legal obligations, including international human rights law, as well as relevant commitments, and should not open the path for undue interference with an individual’s human rights, Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information and democratic participation, Recognizing that the right to privacy is important for the enjoyment of other rights and the free development of an individual’s personality and identity, and contributes to

human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Noting that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, Expressing deep concern that individuals often do not provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the sale or multiple resale of their personal data, as the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, have increased significantly in the digital age, Noting that big data, profiling and machine-learning technologies, sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence, without proper safeguards, may lead to discrimination or decisions that otherwise have the potential to affect the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, and recognizing the need to apply international human rights law to the design, algorithms, evaluation and regulation of these practices, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection and processing of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference

international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable and proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the necessary steps to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Recognizing that respecting the right to privacy contributes to the protection of individuals against the spread of disinformation and propaganda on the Internet, which can be designed and implemented so as to mislead, to violate and abuse human rights and to incite violence, hatred, discrimination or hostility, Emphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect personal data, when they share or otherwise provide access to the data collected on the basis of cross-border intelligence-sharing agreements and when they require the disclosure of personal data from third parties, including private companies, Noting the increase in the collection of sensitive biometric information from individuals, and stressing that States and business enterprises should respect the right to privacy, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and other human rights when collecting, processing, sharing and storing biometric information by, inter alia, implementing data protection policies and safeguards, Noting also that general comment No. 16 recommends that States take effective measures to prevent the unlawful retention, processing and use of personal data stored by public authorities and business enterprises, Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights, as set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations

concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption and anonymity, can be necessary to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and in this regard calling upon States to comply with their obligations under international human rights law and not to interfere with the use of such 4/7 technologies, and to refrain from employing unlawful or arbitrary surveillance techniques, including through hacking, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, human rights defenders and journalists frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy, as a result of their activities, Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting also, in that respect, that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Recognizing that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment is important to the realization of the right to privacy in the digital age, 1.
