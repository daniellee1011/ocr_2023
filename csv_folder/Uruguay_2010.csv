Urges States to enhance efforts to involve men and boys in initiatives to prevent violence against women and in highlighting the unacceptability of violence against women; 13. Stresses that women should be empowered to protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and calls upon States to take all necessary legislative and policy steps; 14. Calls upon States to strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacity of women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by providing HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services, to ensure protection from and prevention of stigma and discrimination, and to cooperate with United Nations bodies, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non- governmental organizations in this regard; 15.

A/C.3/65/L.34/Rev.1 Recalling the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held in New York on 14 and 15 September 2006 for the purpose of discussing the multidimensional aspects of international migration and development, which, among other things, recognized the relationship between international migration, development and human rights, Noting the fourth meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, held in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, from 8 to 11 November 2010, recognizing the discussion on its central theme “Partnerships for migration and human development: shared prosperity — shared responsibility” as a contribution to addressing the multidimensional nature of international migration as well as a step to promote a debate on possible synergies among countries of origin, transit and destination and, where appropriate, other relevant stakeholders, in support of comprehensive and balanced policies, and taking note with appreciation of the generous offer of the Government of Switzerland to assume the Presidency of the Global Forum for 2011, Recognizing the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving societies and their communities of origin, as well as the need to identify appropriate means of maximizing development benefits and responding to the challenges which migration poses to countries of origin, transit and destination, especially in the light of the impact of the economic and financial crisis, and committing to ensuring dignified, humane treatment with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation, Emphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this regard, as appropriate, and the need to protect the human rights of migrants, particularly at a time in which migration flows have increased in the globalized economy and take place in a context of new security concerns, Bearing in mind the obligations of States under international law, as applicable, to exercise due diligence to prevent crimes against migrants and to investigate and punish perpetrators, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, Affirming that crimes against migrants, including trafficking in persons, continue to pose a serious challenge and require a concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for its eradication, Bearing in mind that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including those that refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic approaches that take into account the causes and consequences of the phenomenon, as well as full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, Stressing the importance of regulations and laws regarding irregular migration being in accordance with the obligations of States under international law, including international human rights law, Stressing also the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants regardless of their migration status, and expressing its concern at measures which, including in the context of policies aimed at reducing irregular migration, treat A/C.3/65/L.34/Rev.1 irregular migration as a criminal rather than an administrative offence where the effect of doing so is to deny migrants full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, Aware that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to circumvent restrictive immigration policies, migrants become more vulnerable to, inter alia, kidnapping, extortion, forced labour, sexual exploitation, physical assault, debt servitude and abandonment, Recognizing the contributions of young migrants to countries of origin and destination, and in that regard encouraging States to consider the specific circumstances and needs of young migrants, Concerned about the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and children, who place themselves in a vulnerable situation by attempting to cross international borders without the required travel documents, and recognizing the obligation of States to respect the human rights of those migrants, Stressing that penalties and the treatment given to irregular migrants should be commensurate with their infraction, Recognizing the importance of having a comprehensive and balanced approach to international migration, and bearing in mind that migration enriches the economic, political, social and cultural fabric of States and the historical and cultural ties that exist among some regions, Recognizing also the obligations of countries of origin, transit and destination under international human rights law, Underlining the importance for States, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and other relevant stakeholders, to undertake information campaigns aimed at clarifying opportunities, limitations, risks and rights in the event of migration, so as to enable everyone to make informed decisions and to prevent anyone from utilizing dangerous means to cross international borders, 1.
