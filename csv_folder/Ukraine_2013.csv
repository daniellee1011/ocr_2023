the holding of the General Assembly plenary meeting of 27 July 2011 entitled “The human right to water and sanitation”, Welcoming also the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day, in the context of and pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, entitled “Sanitation for All’, Recalling general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural

Social and Cultural Rights of 19 November 2010, as well as the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that approximately 768 million people still lack access to improved drinking water sources and that more than 2.5 billion do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, including more than 1.04 billion people who still practice open defecation, as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2013 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, and that these figures do not fully capture the dimensions of water safety, the affordability of services and the safe management of excreta and wastewater, as well as equality, non-discrimination and differences between urban and rural areas, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned also that, despite the fact that the target of the Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to improved water sources was formally met five years before its deadline of 2015, the target on sanitation is one of the most off-track on the Millennium Development Goals agenda, that communities continue to be exposed to harmful substances owing to inexistent or inadequate sanitation facilities and that the achieved level of drinking water and sanitation coverage might not be sustainable owing to the serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment, which have a negative impact on water provision and likely also on future access to drinking water, Deeply concerned further that women and girls often face particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, Deeply alarmed that, every year, almost 700,000 children under 5 years of age die, and millions of school days are lost, as a result of water- and sanitation-related diseases, and that girls in large parts of the world do

rights and must take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively

Reaffirms the recognition of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights; 4.

improved sanitation facilities, including more than 1.04 billion people who still practice open defecation, as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2013 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, and that these figures do not fully capture the dimensions of water safety, the affordability of services and the safe

to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic
