East Jerusalem, Recalling General Assembly resolutions on Israeli violations of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, Recalling in particular General Assembly resolution 37/43 of 3 December 1982 reaffirming the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence from foreign domination and foreign occupation and for self-determination, by all available means, Recalling the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), Welcoming the report of the Special

food, Mr. Jean Ziegler (E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2), Expressing its deep concern at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate with the Human Rights Inquiry Commission established pursuant to Commission resolution S-5/1 of 19 October 2000 and its failure to cooperate with other relevant special rapporteurs, particularly Mr. John Dugard, Gravely concerned at the continued deterioration of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and at the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, in particular, acts of extrajudicial killing, closures, collective punishments, the persistence in establishing settlements, arbitrary detentions, siege of Palestinian towns and villages, the shelling of Palestinian residential neighbourhoods by warplanes, tanks and Israeli battleships, and incursions into towns, villages and camps to kill innocent men, women and children, as was the case in Jenin, Balata, Khan Younis, Rafah, Ramallah, Gaza, Nablus, Al-Birah, Al-Amari, Jabalia, Bethlehem and Dheisheh and in the Al-Daraj and Al-Zaitoun neighbourhoods in the city of Gaza, and also during recent months in the Rafah and in Al-Shajai’ia neighbourhood in Gaza, as well as during the last Israeli massacres in the Al-Nusseirat and Al-Burreij refugee camps in the centre of the Gaza Strip on 7 March 2004, Expressing its grave concern at the continued Israeli aggression and the resulting deaths and injuries, mostly among Palestinians, the toll of casualties having increased to over 2,800 martyrs and over 25,000 wounded since 28 September 2000, Taking note of the reports of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories submitted to the General Assembly since 1968, the last of which was A/58/311, Expressing its grave concern at the continued Israeli refusal to abide by the resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights calling upon Israel to put an end to the violations of human rights and affirming the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, Convinced that the basis of negotiations and of achieving a just and lasting peace should be Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions, including the principle of the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war, the need for every State in the area to be able to live in security and the principle of land for peace, Recalling all its previous resolutions in this respect, the latest of which is resolution 2003/6 of 15 April 2003, Recalling also the inadmissibility of the acquisition of others’ land by force, which constitutes a jus cogens in international law, Gravely concerned at the construction of the Israeli wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, aimed at expropriating further Palestinian lands by force, with all the drastic consequences that this wall will have on the Palestinian community, namely on its social, economic, educational, health and psychological aspects, and which is destroying any possibility of achieving a genuine peace based on the two-State solution, with an independent Palestinian State and an Israeli State, Affirming that the construction of this wall on the Palestinian territories constitutes a violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and hinders the exercise by the Palestinian people of this right, Recalling in this respect General Assembly resolution ES-10/13 of 21 October 2003, Recalling also the report of the Secretary-General (A/ES-10/248), which concluded that Israel is not in compliance with the Assembly’s demand that “it stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”, 1. Reaffirms the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to resist the Israeli occupation in order to free its land and be able to exercise its right to self-determination, in conformity with the goals and purposes stipulated by the Charter of the United Nations; 2. Strongly condemns once more the human rights violations of the Israeli occupation authorities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, since 1967; 3. Also strongly condemns the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories as being an aggression and an offence against humanity and a flagrant violation of human rights; 4. Further strongly condemns the war launched by the Israeli army, particularly since October 2000, against Palestinian towns and camps, which has resulted so far in the death of hundreds of Palestinian civilians, including women and children; 5. Strongly condemns anew the practice of “liquidation” or “extrajudicial executions” carried out by the Israeli army against Palestinians, a practice which not only constitutes a violation of human rights norms, a flagrant violation of article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the rule of law, but which is also damaging for the relationship between the parties and therefore constitutes an obstacle to peace, and urges the Government of Israel to respect international law and immediately to put an end to such practices; 6. Strongly condemns once again the establishment of Israeli settlements and other related activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, such as the construction of new settlements and the expansion of the existing ones, land confiscation, biased administration of water resources and the construction of bypass roads, which not only constitute grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, especially article 49 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949 (the Fourth Geneva Convention) and Additional Protocol I thereto of 1977, according to which such violations are categorized as war crimes, but are also major obstacles to peace, urges the Government of Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions as well as the resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights relative to the Israeli settlements, and affirms that the dismantling of Israeli settlements constitutes an essential factor for achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region; 7. Condemns once again the expropriation of Palestinian homes in Jerusalem, Hebron and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the revocation of the identity cards of the residents of East Jerusalem and the policy of imposing fabricated and exorbitant taxes with the aim of forcing Palestinians living in Jerusalem, who cannot afford to pay these high taxes, out of their homes and out of their city, with the aim of Judaizing Jerusalem, and calls upon the Government of Israel to put an end immediately to these practices; 8. Also condemns once again the use of torture against Palestinians during interrogation, as it constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international humanitarian law, of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and also of article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and calls upon the Government of Israel to immediately put an end to such practices and to bring the perpetrators of these violations to justice; 9. Strongly condemns once more the offensives of the Israeli army of occupation against hospitals and sick persons and the use of Palestinian citizens as human shields during Israeli incursions into Palestinian areas; 10. Also strongly condemns once more the Israeli army of occupation’s practices of opening fire on ambulances and paramedical personnel and preventing ambulances and vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross from reaching the wounded and the dead in order to transport them to hospital, thus leaving the wounded bleeding to death in the streets; 10. 11. Strongly condemns acts of mass killing of Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli occupation authorities, including the killing of children, such as recently took place in Nablus, Gaza, Rafah, Al-Nusseirat and Al-Burreij and which persist to this day; 11. 12. Also strongly condemns acts that consist of imposing collective punishments, military siege of Palestinian territories, isolating Palestinian towns and villages from each other by military roadblocks used as a trap to kill Palestinians, demolishing houses and levelling agricultural lands, as these practices contribute, together with other factors, to the acts of violence that have prevailed in the region for over three and a half years, and calls upon the Government of Israel immediately to put an end to these practices and to lift its military siege of Palestinian towns and villages and its military roadblocks, and affirms anew that such collective punishments are prohibited under international law, as they constitute grave violations of the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I thereto, and also are 12. war crimes; 13. Expresses its grave concern once again at the restriction of the freedom of movement imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities on Yasser Arafat, the democratically elected Palestinian President, in violation of articles 9 and 13 of the Universal Declaration of 13. Human Rights; 14. Strongly condemns campaigns of massive arrests conducted by the Israeli occupation authorities to detain thousands of Palestinians without trial and without any criminal charges having been brought against them, in violation of article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention in this respect; 14. 15. Affirms anew that the demolitions carried out by the Israeli occupying forces of at least thirty thousand Palestinian houses, facilities and property constitute grave violations of articles 33 and 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and that acts of levelling farmlands, uprooting trees and destroying what is left of the Palestinian infrastructure constitute a form of collective punishment to which Palestinians are subjected, grave violations of the provisions of international humanitarian law and war crimes according to international law; 15. 16. Affirms anew that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and considers any change in the geographical, demographic and institutional status of the city of East Jerusalem from its status prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void; 16. 17. Calls once again upon Israel, the occupying Power, to desist from all forms of human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other occupied Arab territories, and to respect the principles of international law, international humanitarian law, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its international commitments and its signed agreements with the Palestine Liberation Organization; 17. 18. Also calls once again upon Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Commission on Human Rights, as a basic condition for achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East; 18. 19. Strongly condemns the construction of the Israeli wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in the West Bank, as it constitutes a new Israeli pretext for the forcible confiscation of further Palestinian lands, it endangers the social, economic, cultural, educational, health and psychological aspects of the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians as well as their familial unity, it prevents Palestinians from having access to their natural resources and it constitutes a major obstacle to achieving a just and lasting peace on the basis of the two-State 19. solution, with an independent Palestinian State and Israeli State, the only solution which guarantees peace and stability in the region, and it also prevents Palestinians from exercising their right to self-determination; and calls on Israel immediately to stop the construction of the said wall and to erase what it has already built of this wall inside the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967; 20. Requests the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, to investigate Israel’s violations of the principles and bases of international law, international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and, in his capacity as a monitoring mechanism, to follow up on the implementation of these recommendations and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session, until the end of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as established in Commission resolution 1993/2 A of 1993; 20. 21. Calls upon the relevant United Nations organs urgently to consider the best ways to provide the necessary international protection for the Palestinian people until the end of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories; 21. 22. Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of the Government of Israel and all other Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized agencies, regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, to disseminate it on the widest possible scale and to report on its implementation by the Government of Israel to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session; 22. 23.

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1. Stresses that the proposal of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and, therefore, unacceptable; 11. 12. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office in Geneva; 12. 13. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 13. 14. Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 14. 15. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from non-represented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 15. 16. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 16. 17. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 17. 18. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 18. 19. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 19. 20. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 20. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 21. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of his mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 21. 22. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 22. Also requests the High Commissioner: 23. (a) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (b) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; () To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-first session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 24. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 25. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Right (JIU/REP/2003/6), in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 25. 26. Requests the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other intergovernmental bodies of the Organization regarding the management, programmes and 26. administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; Decides to consider this matter under the same agenda item at its 27. sixty-first session.

Draft negotiating text on simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism A. Introduction 1. Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism (CDM) shall follow the stages of the project cycle specified in the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM contained in the annex to decision 19/CP.9 (hereinafter referred to as the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM). In order to reduce transaction costs, modalities and procedures are simplified for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM as follows: [Project activities may be bundled or portfolio bundled at the following stages in the project cycle: the project design document, validation, registration, monitoring, verification and certification. [The size of the total bundle should not exceed the limits stipulated in paragraph 1 (i) of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM]]; (a) The requirements for the project design document are reduced; (b) Baseline methodologies by project type are simplified to reduce the cost of developing a project baseline; (©) Monitoring plans are simplified, including simplified monitoring requirements, to reduce monitoring costs; (d) The same operational entity may undertake validation, and verification and certification. () 2. Simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies may be developed for types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. They are presented in appendix B. This list shall not preclude other types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. If a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM does not fall into any of the types in appendix B, the project participants may submit a request to the Executive Board of the CDM (hereinafter referred to as the Executive Board) for approval of a simplified baseline and/or monitoring plan developed bearing in mind the provisions in paragraph 8 below. 3. The modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM shall apply to small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM except for paragraphs 12-30. The following paragraphs 4-34 apply instead. Appendix A should replace, as appropriate, the provisions in appendix B of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. B. Simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism 4. To use simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation CDM project activities, a proposed project activity shall: Meet the eligibility criteria for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM set out in paragraph 1 (i) of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM; (a) Conform to one of the project types in appendix B; (b) Not be a debundled component of a larger project activity, as determined through appendix C. (©) 5. Project participants shall prepare a project design document in accordance with the format specified in appendix A. 6. Project participants may use the simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies specified in appendix B. 7. Project participants involved in small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM may propose changes to the simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies specified in appendix B or propose additional project types for consideration by the Executive Board. 8. Project participants willing to submit a new small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM type or revisions to a methodology shall make a request in writing to the Executive Board providing information about the activity and proposals on how a simplified baseline and monitoring methodology would be applied to this type. The Board may draw on expertise, as appropriate, in considering new project types and/or revisions of and amendments to simplified methodologies. The Executive Board shall expeditiously, if possible at its next meeting, review the proposed methodology. Once it is approved, the Executive Board shall amend appendix B. The Executive Board shall review and amend, as necessary, appendix B at least once a year. 10. Any amendments to appendix B shall apply only to small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM which are registered subsequent to the date of amendment and shall not affect already registered small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM during the crediting periods for which they are registered. 11. [Several small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities under the CDM may be bundled for the purpose of validation. An overall monitoring plan that monitors performance of the constituent project activities on a sample basis may be proposed for bundled project activities. If bundled project activities are registered with an overall monitoring plan, this monitoring plan shall be implemented and each verification/certification of the net anthropogenic removals by sinks achieved shall cover all of the bundled project activities. | 12. A single designated operational entity (DOE) may perform validation as well as verification and certification for a small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM [or bundled small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM]. 13. The Executive Board, in proposing the share of proceeds to cover administrative expenses and registration fees to recover any project-related expenses, may consider proposing lower fees for small- scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. C. Validation and registration 14. The DOE selected by project participants to validate a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, being under a contractual arrangement with them, shall review the project design document and any supporting documentation to confirm that the following requirements have been met: The participation requirements set out in paragraphs 28—30 of the annex to decision 17/CP.7 and paragraphs 8 and 9 of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM are satisfied (a) Comments by local stakeholders have been invited, a summary of the comments received has been provided, and a report to the DOE on how due account was taken of any comments has been received (b) Project participants have submitted to the DOE documentation on the analysis of the socio-economic and environmental impacts, including impacts on biodiversity and natural ecosystems, and impacts outside the project boundary, of the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM. If any negative impact is considered significant by the project participants or the host Party, project participants have undertaken a socio-economic impact assessment and/or an environmental impact assessment in accordance with the procedures required by the host Party. Project participants shall submit a statement that confirms that they have undertaken such an assessment in accordance with the procedures required by the host Party and include a description of the planned monitoring and remedial measures to address them (©) The proposed small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activity under the CDM is additional if the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks are increased above the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, in accordance with paragraphs 18—19 below (d) Project participants have specified the approach proposed to address non-permanence in accordance with paragraph 38 of the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM () The proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM conforms to one of the types in appendix B and uses one of the simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies specified in appendix B, and the estimation of the existing carbon stock is conducted in an appropriate manner ® [A bundle of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities satisfies the conditions for bundling and the overall monitoring plan for the bundled small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities is appropriate] (9] Project participants provide information regarding leakage in accordance with appendix B (h) The proposed project activity conforms to all requirements, including monitoring, verification and reporting, for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM in decision 19/CP.9, its annex on modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM that are not replaced by these simplified modalities and procedures, as well as relevant decisions by the Conference of the Parties (i) serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP) and the Executive Board. The DOE shall: 15. Prior to the submission of the validation report to the Executive Board, have received from the project participants written approval of voluntary participation from the designated national authority of each Party involved, including confirmation by the host Party that the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM assists it in achieving sustainable development [and is developed or implemented by low-income communities and individuals]; (a) [Prior to the submission of the validation report to the Executive Board, have received from the project participants a written declaration that the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is developed or implemented by low-income communities and individuals as determined by the Host Party.] (b) In accordance with the provisions on confidentiality contained in paragraph 27 (h) of the annex to decision 17/CP.7, make the project design document publicly available; (©) Receive, within 30 days, comments on the validation requirements from Parties, stakeholders and UNFCCC-accredited non-governmental organizations, and make them publicly available; (d) After the deadline for receipt of comments, make a determination as to whether, on the basis of the information provided and taking into account the comments received, the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM should be validated; () Inform project participants of its determination on the validation of the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM. The notification to the project participants will include a confirmation of validation and the date of submission of the validation report to the Executive Board, or an explanation of reasons for non- acceptance if the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, as documented, is judged not to fulfil the requirements for validation; ® Submit to the Executive Board, if it determines the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM to be valid, a request for registration in the form of a validation report including the project design document, the written approval of voluntary participation from the designated national authority of each Party involved, as referred to in paragraph 15 (a) above, and an explanation of how it has taken due account of comments received; (9] Make this validation report publicly available upon transmission to the Executive Board. (h) 16. The registration by the Executive Board shall be deemed final four weeks after the date of receipt by the Executive Board of the request for registration, unless a Party involved in the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, or at least three members of the Executive Board, request a review of the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM. The review by the Executive Board shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: It shall be related to issues associated with the validation requirements; (a) It shall be finalized no later than at the second meeting following the request for review, with the decision and the reasons for it being communicated to the project participants and the public. (b) 17. A proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM that is not accepted may be reconsidered for validation and subsequent registration after appropriate revisions, provided that this project activity follows the procedures and meets the requirements for validation and registration, including those relating to public comments. 18. A small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is additional if the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks are increased above the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM. 19. The baseline for a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is the scenario that reasonably represents the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would have occurred in the absence of the proposed project activity. A baseline shall be deemed to reasonably represent the sum of the changes in carbon stocks in the carbon pools within the project boundary that would occur in the absence of the proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM if it is derived using a baseline methodology referred to in appendix B. 20. A simplified baseline and monitoring methodology listed in appendix B may be used for a small- scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM if the project participants are able to demonstrate to a DOE that the project activity would otherwise not be implemented due to the existence of one or more of the barriers listed in attachment A of appendix B. Where specified in appendix B for a project type, quantitative evidence that the project activity would otherwise not be implemented may be provided instead of a demonstration based on the barriers listed in attachment A to appendix B. 21. The crediting period shall begin at the start of the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM. The crediting period for a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM shall be either of the following: A maximum of 20 years which may be renewed at most two times, provided that, for each renewal, a DOE determines and informs the Executive Board that the original project baseline is still valid or has been updated taking account of new data where applicable (a) A maximum of 30 years. (b) 22. A small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM shall be designed in such a manner as to minimize leakage. D. Monitoring 23. Project participants shall include, as part of the project design document for a small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM [or a bundle of small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities under the CDM,] a monitoring plan that provides for: The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for estimating or measuring the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks during the crediting period as specified in appendix B (a) The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for determining the baseline net greenhouse gas removals by sinks during the crediting period as specified in appendix B (b) [Unless project participants have successfully shown to the DOE that significant leakage is not expected to occur, the identification of all potential sources of, and the collection and archiving of data on, leakage during the crediting period as specified in appendix B] (©) Changes in circumstances within the project boundary that affect legal title to the land or rights of access to the carbon pools (d) [Simplified] Quality assurance and quality control procedures for the monitoring process in accordance with appendix B () Procedures for the periodic calculation of the net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks due to the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, and documentation of the steps involved in those calculations ® Procedures for the review of implementation of relevant measures to minimize leakage where the circumstances of the project activity have changed in a manner that may result in, or increase, leakage. (9] 24. The monitoring plan for a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM may use the monitoring methodology specified in appendix B for the relevant project activity if the DOE determines at validation that the monitoring methodology reflects good monitoring practice appropriate to the circumstances of the project activity. 25. [If small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities under the CDM are bundled, a separate monitoring plan shall apply for each of the constituent project activities in accordance with paragraphs 23 and 24 above, or an overall monitoring plan shall apply for the bundled projects, as determined by the DOE at validation to reflect good monitoring practice appropriate to the bundled project activities and to provide for the collection and archiving of the data needed to calculate the net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks achieved by the bundled project activities. Good practice may include monitoring of a sample of projects in a bundle.] 26. Project participants shall implement the monitoring plan contained in the registered project design document, archive the relevant monitored data and report the relevant monitoring data to a DOE contracted to verify the net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks achieved during the crediting period specified by the project participants. 27. Revisions, if any, to the monitoring plan to improve the accuracy and/or completeness of information shall be justified by project participants and shall be submitted for validation to a DOE. 28. The implementation of the registered monitoring plan and its revisions, as applicable, shall be a condition for verification, certification and the issuance of tCERs or ICERs. 29. The project participants shall provide to the DOE contracted by the project participants to perform the verification a monitoring report in accordance with the registered monitoring plan set out in paragraph 23 above for the purpose of verification and certification. E. Additional proposals for simplified modalities 30. [Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM shall be exempt from the share of proceeds to cover the costs of adaptation. ] 31. [Project participants may incorporate additional areas within the project boundary until net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks achieved by the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM are equal to 8 kt of CO, per year, provided that the newly incorporated areas have similar characteristics of baselines and additionality.] 32. [Option 1: Project participants may decide which carbon pools will be included in the assessment of changes in carbon stocks. They may choose to exclude any pool without having to provide further information. Option 2: Project participants may exclude from the monitoring of the baseline net greenhouse gas removals by sinks and actual greenhouse gas removals by sinks those carbon pools for which no significant changes in carbon stocks are expected or those which it is not possible to assess. | 33. [Non-CO, emissions resulting from small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities under the CDM, such as increases of nitrous oxide due to fertilization, should be estimated and deducted from the net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks only if they represent 15 per cent or more of the proposed net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks. [Default methods as outlined in the /PCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry may be used for their assessment.]] 34. [In the absence of formal land property, tenure or use rights, recognized customary or access rights to the land should be a sufficient condition for low-income communities and individuals to participate in the CDM. A substantial proportion of the benefits from the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM should be assigned to these low-income communities and individuals.] 35. [The host Party and/or the investor Party may, with the [consent] of the project participants, coordinate several small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM with a view to diminishing the costs of validation, verification and certification.] Appendix A Project design document for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism 1. The purpose of this appendix is to outline the information required in the project design document for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM.

() Appendix B Indicative simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies for selected types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the clean development mechanism 1. The Executive Board shall develop an indicative list of simplified methodologies for selected types of small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM, in accordance with the following guidance: Baseline methodology 2. If project participants can provide relevant information that indicates that in the absence of the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM no significant changes in the carbon stocks within the project boundary would have occurred, they shall assess the existing carbon stocks prior to the implementation of the project activity. The existing carbon stocks shall be considered as the baseline and shall be assumed to be constant throughout the crediting period. 3. If significant changes in the carbon stocks within the project boundary would be expected to occur in the absence of the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity, project participants shall use simplified baseline methodologies to be developed by the Executive Board. 4. The Executive Board shall develop simplified baseline methodologies, for the following types of small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities:' Grassland to forested land (a) Cropland to forested land (b) Wetland to forested land (©) Settlements to forested land (d) 5. The Executive Board shall consider the types referred to in paragraph 4 above and develop, for consideration by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its eleventh session, default factors for assessing the existing carbon stocks and for simplified baseline methodologies, taking into account, if appropriate, types of soils, lifetime of the project and climatic conditions. Project participants may use either the default factors or project-specific methods, provided they reflect good practice appropriate to the type of the project activity. Monitoring methodology No monitoring of the baseline is requested. 7. The Executive Board shall develop, for consideration by the COP at its eleventh session, simplified monitoring methodologies based on appropriate statistical methods to estimate or measure the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks. As appropriate, the Executive Board may indicate different methods for different types of afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM and ' The land categories shall be consistent with those defined in chapter 2 (Basis for consistent representation of land areas) of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. propose default factors, if any, to facilitate the estimation or measurement of actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks. 8. The Executive Board shall consider ways to simplify the information requirements needed to determine that one or more carbon pools and/or greenhouse gas emissions can be excluded from the estimation of the baseline net greenhouse gas removals by sinks and/or the actual net greenhouse gas removals by sinks. Leakage 9. If project participants demonstrate that the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM does not result in the displacement of activities or people, or does not trigger activities outside the project boundary, that would have been attributable to the small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM, such that an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by sources occurs, a leakage estimation is not required. In all other cases leakage estimation is required. The Executive Board shall develop guidelines to estimate leakage. Attachment A to Appendix B (The attachment A to appendix B, referred to in paragraph 20 of the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM, shall be developed by the Executive Board, taking into consideration the existing list of barriers for non-afforestation and reforestation CDM project activities, as contained in attachment A to appendix B of annex II to decision 21/CP.8.) Appendix C Criteria for determining the occurrence of debundling 1. Debundling is defined as the fragmentation of a large project activity into smaller parts. A small- scale project activity that is part of a large project activity is not eligible to use the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. The full project activity or any component of the full project activity shall follow the regular modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. 2. A proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM shall be deemed to be a debundled component of a large project activity if there is a registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM or an application to register another afforestation or reforestation small-scale project activity under the CDM: With the same project participants (a) Registered within the previous two years (b) Whose project boundary is within 1 km of the project boundary of the proposed small- scale afforestation or reforestation activity under the CDM at the closest point. (©) 3. If a proposed small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM is deemed to be a debundled component in accordance with paragraph 2 above, but the total size of such an activity combined with the previously registered small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activity under the CDM does not exceed the limits for small-scale afforestation or reforestation project activities under the CDM as set out in paragraph 1 (h) of the annex to decision 19/CP.9, the project activity can qualify to use simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM. II. Recommendation of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice [The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), at its twenty-first session, decided to recommend the following decision for adoption by the Conference of the Parties at its tenth session:] Draft decision -/CP.10 [Good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, of the Kyoto Protocol] The Conference of the Parties, Recalling decisions 11/CP.7, 19/CP.7, 21/CP.7, 22/CP.7 and 13/CP.9, [1.
