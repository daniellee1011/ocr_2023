A/C.3/54/L.11 Annex Guidelines aimed at creating a supportive environment for the development of cooperatives Introduction In its resolution 51/58 of 12 December 1996, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to ascertain, in cooperation with the Committee for the Promotion and Advancement of Cooperatives, the desirability and feasibility of elaborating United Nations guidelines aimed at creating a supportive environment for the development of cooperatives and to include his findings and recommendations in a report to be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session. In response to that request, the Committee took up the matter at its fifty-sixth session, held at Geneva in November 1996. It decided in principle that such guidelines were highly desirable: the only existing guidance was provided by Cooperatives (Developing Countries) Recommendation No. 127, adopted on 21 June 1966 by the General Conference of the International Labour Organization. A meeting of experts on cooperatives was held at Geneva from 29 March to 2 April 1993 by the International Labour Organization. It concluded that, after nearly three decades of substantial change in global economic and social conditions in the cooperative movement and in the relations between it and Governments, there was need to change the tone and emphasis of the Recommendation to reassess the underlying concepts of aid to cooperatives and to include matters not addressed by it. Moreover, in the view of the Commiittee, there was an urgent need for guidance to many Governments on policy regarding cooperatives and the cooperative movement in view of the importance of the movement, as agreed upon by them at the series of recent global conferences for new forms of collaboration and partnership with major stakeholders within society. New forms of relationships between Governments and the cooperative movement had been called for at a series of ministerial level meetings organized by the International Cooperative Alliance. The role and status of both Governments and the cooperative movement had changed drastically in formerly socialist countries and in many other developing countries. The international cooperative movement itself had comprehensively reviewed its values and principles and the nature of its proper relationship with other sections of society, including Governments, and had adopted a new “Statement on the Cooperative Identity” at the centennial congress of the International Cooperative Alliance in 1995. In order to explore the feasibility of elaborating such guidelines, the Committee appointed a consultant to prepare a . A first version was reviewed and a second version examined at a consultative meeting attended by specialists from around the world, as well as by representatives of members of the Committee, at Geneva in May 1997. On the basis of extensive examination at that meeting, a third version of the guidelines was prepared. The guidelines were circulated widely in print and electronic version. The electronic version of the guidelines was posted on the Committee for the Promotion and Advancement of Cooperatives Web site in January 1998. A printed version was also included in the International Day of Cooperatives press pack, which was mailed in July 1998 to over 2,000 organizations. The Committee also requested input from a number of cooperative organizations on an individual basis and briefed and provided copies of the guidelines at the International Cooperative Alliance meeting of chairpersons of the specialized bodies in March of 1998. No major comments to the guidelines were received by the Secretariat with the exception of a critical review by the Industrial Common Ownership Movement, which was circulated to members upon receipt. Other than this comment, there have been no negative A/C.3/54/L.11 reactions to the guidelines or any suggestions for improvements. Specific comments of approval were received from the International Cooperative Alliance Board, which reviewed and adopted the guidelines at their meeting in Tokyo in April 1998, and from the Federation of Danish Cooperatives. The representative of the International Labour Organization also reported that, despite the fact that the proposal for the revision of ILO Recommendation 127 was not accepted, the discussion of the item indicated that Governments in developing countries supported having a new standard on cooperatives, thus showing that there was a need for some sort of guidelines. On the basis of the process of elaborating this , the Committee is able to advise the Secretary-General that it considers further elaboration of guidelines to be entirely feasible. During the process of wide circulation of the s of the guidelines by the Committee, the views expressed by specialists within the cooperative movement as well as in governmental and intergovernmental organizations is unanimously that such guidelines are desirable. Objectives 1. Within the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, and at major recent international conferences, Governments have acknowledged the significance of cooperatives as associations and enterprises through which citizens effectively overcome a wide range of problems and achieve many of their goals. They have recognized the cooperative movement as a distinct and major stakeholder in both national and international affairs. 2. Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic, locally autonomous but internationally integrated, and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives, such as overcoming poverty, securing productive employment and encouraging social integration. 3. Consequently, Governments seek to support the cooperative movement and to work closely with it to develop an effective partnership to achieve their respective goals. Policies setting out the objectives and means of support and collaboration are valuable instruments for ensuring that the potential of cooperatives for meeting the individual goals of citizens who are members, and through this the aspirations of the wider societies of which they are a part, is realized. 4. However, such policies can be effective only if they take into account the special character of cooperatives and the cooperative movement, which differs significantly from that of associations and enterprises not organized according to cooperative values and principles. 5. The objective of the present guidelines is to provide advice to Governments that is appropriate to contemporary and anticipated conditions. Because of the expectations shown by Governments in recent years regarding the cooperative movement and the rapidly changing global conditions and changes in the cooperative movement itself, many policies in most of the States Members of the United Nations might benefit from review, and in some cases from substantial revision. Given the relevance of cooperatives to many aspects of national life, as well as the special nature of cooperative organization, policy in respect to cooperatives may be complex and sensitive. It is the purpose of these guidelines to set out succinctly the principles on which national policy might best be based and the scope and content likely to suffice as a framework for the necessarily more specific and detailed national policies which fall within the responsibility of each Government. Policy regarding cooperatives and the cooperative movement A/C.3/54/L.11 6. The objective of the policy is to ensure that cooperatives, recognized as legal entities, are assured real equality with other types of associations and enterprises, and that this equality is extended to all organizations and institutions set up by the cooperative movement. Enjoyment of such equality requires that the special values and principles of cooperative organization, expressed in the particular forms taken by cooperative organization, receive full recognition as being desirable and beneficial to society and that appropriate measures are taken to ensure that their special qualities and practices are not the cause of discrimination and disadvantage of any kind. 7. To achieve this objective, Governments are concerned with creating, and with maintaining as conditions change, a supportive and enabling environment for cooperative development. As part of such an environment, it is useful if every effort is made to create and maintain an effective partnership between Governments and the cooperative movement. Public recognition 8. It is appropriate and useful for Governments to acknowledge publicly the special contribution, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, made by the cooperative movement to the national economy and society. It is also beneficial for Governments to acknowledge and publicize the purposes of all forms of partnership and collaboration between themselves and the cooperative movement. A number of specific actions may be useful, one of which might be full participation in the annual joint observance of the United Nations International Day of Cooperatives and the International Cooperative Day organized by the International Cooperative Alliance, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 47/90, 49/155 and 51/58; and appropriate participation in other celebrations of the cooperative movement. Legal, judicial and administrative provisions 9. Appropriate provision is necessary within legal, judicial and administrative practice if these most important areas of the environment in which cooperatives exist are to contribute positively to the supportive and enabling nature of that environment. Legal provisions may take various forms appropriate to individual national legal systems. The status, rights and responsibilities of cooperatives and the cooperative movement in general, as well as, if appropriate, those of special categories of cooperatives or of distinct aspects of cooperation should be addressed. 10. National constitutions: These instruments could acknowledge, if appropriate, the legitimacy of cooperatives and the cooperative movement and the utility of their contribution to national life. 11. General law on cooperatives or the general section of a single law on cooperatives: A general law on cooperatives could form the basic element in legal provisions and the fundamental point of guidance for all judicial and administrative practice. Participation by representatives of the cooperative movement in its formulation would be a valuable means to ensure its relevance and utility. It should acknowledge the nature of cooperation and its utility, set out criteria for treatment of cooperatives in law and define the nature of governmental responsibilities as well as the rights and responsibilities of the cooperative movement. It should include the following basic set of acknowledgments, definitions and provisions, certain of which might be set out in a preambular section: acknowledgment that the organization of associations and enterprises on the basis of cooperative values and principles is legitimate; acknowledgment of the utility of the cooperative approach to association and enterprise, its contribution to national life and the status of the cooperative movement as a significant stakeholder within society; definition of cooperatives, using the “Statement on the Cooperative Identity” adopted by the International Cooperative Alliance A/C.3/54/L.11 in 1995; recognition of the unique nature of the values and principles of cooperation, and hence the need for their separate and distinct treatment in law and practice; commitment that neither their unique nature nor their separate and distinct treatment in law and practice should be the cause of discrimination, intended or not; undertaking that no law or practice should restrict the rights of citizens to full participation in the cooperative movement in any capacity consistent with its values and principles and should not restrict the operation of that movement; provision that a general law apply to all categories of cooperatives but that, in order to respond to the situation of certain categories of cooperatives, special laws might be enacted, consistent with the general law; stipulation that all judicial and administrative regulations and practices be based only on the general or special laws on cooperatives; that all regulations clearly identify the provision of the law on which they are based and the purpose for which they are made; recognition of the full autonomy and capacity for self- regulation of the cooperative movement; acknowledgment that intervention by Governments in the internal affairs of the movement should be strictly limited to measures applied generally to all associations and enterprises equally in order to ensure their conformity with the law. Adjustments may be made only to ensure: real equality in treatment; definition of the responsibilities of the cooperative movement for self-regulation in all matters distinctive to it; provision that the texts of laws and regulations be made available to all cooperative members and employees; provision that representatives of the cooperative movement participate fully in ing special laws or judicial or administrative regulations and guidelines concerning practice; provision for the maintenance of a public register of cooperatives as a part of procedures for registration of all associations and enterprises; provision for procedures for continuous monitoring and regular review of law and practice which would include the full and equal participation of representatives of the cooperative movement and for encouragement of research on the effect of law and practice on the environment for cooperatives; establishment of the responsibility of Governments to formulate and carry out a policy in respect to cooperatives that would seek to establish a supportive and enabling environment while avoiding any infringement of the autonomy of the movement and any diminution of its capacity for responsible self-regulation and would seek also to engage in an effective and equal partnership with the movement in all matters where it is able to contribute significantly to the formulation and carrying out of public policy; recognition of the value of governmental support for the international cooperative movement, including through intergovernmental activities; and definition of the responsibilities of the cooperative movement as a major stakeholder in society, to the extent these responsibilities are consistent with its full autonomy. These responsibilities include making available its experience in self- reliant, people-oriented and community-based organizations of associations and enterprises. 12. Special laws on certain categories of cooperatives: These must be consistent with the basic provisions set out in either a general law or in the preambular and initial sections of a single law where neither exists. Each special law should provide the same set of such basic provisions. They may be necessary when the distinctive nature of cooperatives requires special provision in law to safeguard their autonomy while achieving their equal although distinctive inclusion in generally applicable regulations. This is often the case in respect to financial cooperatives. 13. Judicial and administrative practice concerned explicitly with cooperatives: These must be consistent with the general law on cooperatives and, specifically, with its provisions concerning such practice. 14. All other laws and practices insofar as they may have an effect on cooperatives: Many laws and judicial and administrative practices may affect the environment in which cooperatives operate, whether intentionally or not. Relevant governmental bodies should make every effort to exclude any discriminatory or prejudicial impact. Responsibility for identifying A/C.3/54/L.11 cases needing revision lies with the cooperative movement. Government bodies should assist by making available the full text of s of proposed laws or regulations as well as any evaluation of their impact. 15. Monitoring, review and revision of laws and judicial and administrative practices: This is necessary to ensure that the impact of laws and judicial and administrative practices on the cooperative movement is entirely positive. If identified, discriminatory provisions should be rendered inoperative as quickly as possible pending enactment of revised laws or the issuance of revised regulations and guidelines concerning practice. This process should have as its purpose the early and complete disengagement by Governments from the internal affairs of cooperatives and the cooperative movement, where this still exists, and full operational realization of the principles that cooperatives, although different, are equal to other business enterprises and civil associations. 16. For these purposes, formal procedures for consultation and collaboration should be set up and should include regular and full participation by the cooperative movement. Advantage may be taken also of the special programmes and guidelines offered by specialized international cooperative organizations and intergovernmental organizations. Research, statistics and information 17. Research: Given the significance of the cooperative movement, its own research and development programmes and the active role of Governments in supporting research generally, it is appropriate to undertake the following measures: recognition of the contribution of the cooperative movement itself, and hence disengagement from any direct intervention other than that applied to any recipient of public funding; provision for equal access as other types of associations, enterprises or movements to public funds; collaboration between governmental and cooperative movement research on matters relevant to public policy; publication and wide diffusion of research results, including those produced by the international cooperative movement, intergovernmental organizations and the United Nations. Emphasis should be on applied research of immediate utility in improving the efficiency of cooperatives, extending benefits to society and improving partnerships between the cooperative movement and Governments. 18. Statistics: Several measures may be undertaken to improve statistics for and about cooperatives: extend technical support provided by the national statistical service to the cooperative movement to an extent at least equal to that provided to other major stakeholders; assist in preparation of the annual report of the register of cooperatives; undertake preliminary studies on which to base integration of statistics on cooperatives in regular programmes of the national statistical service and participate in international efforts to improve cooperative statistics, including the establishment of a uniform set of definitions for use by national statistical services. 19. Information: Given that Governments regulate and broadly influence information diffusion, a number of measures may be useful in expanding knowledge of the cooperative movement and overcoming prejudices and misconceptions: extension of technical and financial assistance to an extent equal to that made available to other stakeholders; ensuring that no discrimination exists because of the distinctive nature of cooperatives; equal and non- discriminatory access by the cooperative movement to all public media commensurate with its contribution to national life; use of affirmative action to overcome prejudice and misinformation where the term cooperative is associated with a previous and inappropriate usage; diffusion through public media of material on intergovernmental activities undertaken in partnership with or in support of cooperatives; dissemination of printed and computer-based A/C.3/54/L.11 information prepared by governmental or intergovernmental bodies with the same priority and resources as allocated to information on other stakeholders. Education 20. Given the important contributions of the cooperative movement to education, a number of supportive and enabling measures might be useful: acknowledgment of the contributions made; commitment to non-interference in the movement’s own programmes other than those generally applied in order to maintain standards in all educational institutions; avoidance of discrimination in certification and accreditation; support for all forms of collaboration and partnership between cooperative and public systems and assurance of equality with other types of private education (where this exists) in respect to eligibility for public funds; consideration of the option constituted by cooperative organization in programmes of privatization; encouragement of self-reliance among students by facilitating the formation of cooperatives to supply them with goods and services, including accommodation; encouragement of formation by public educational institutions of purchasing, supply and common service cooperatives; assurance of equal access by cooperatives with other suppliers, inclusion within the national curricula at all levels of the study of the values principles, history, current and potential contribution of the cooperative movement to national society; and encouragement and support of specialized studies in cooperatives at the tertiary level. Provision of public funds 21. Financial self-reliance, total responsibility and full independence are vital for an effective cooperative enterprise. The best policy approach is one where cooperatives receive the same treatment as any other form of enterprise. A number of other measures are valuable: acknowledgement and protection of the special character of cooperatives and avoidance in law or practice of any discrimination arising from the special financial status, organization and management of cooperatives; avoidance of any direct or indirect engagement in the internal financial affairs of cooperatives or of the cooperative movement and recognition of the full responsibility of the movement for its own financial affairs; and the development of partnerships with cooperative financial institutions in such matters as community and regional development, drawing on their experience of mobilizing and managing capital in a manner and for purposes conducive to the public good. Institutional arrangements for collaboration and partnership 22. Many governmental departments and bodies will have contact with the cooperative movement, while a policy of enabling and supporting cooperatives and operating an effective partnership with the movement will involve actions by a wide range of governmental institutions. In order to ensure consistency with broad general policy, certain coordinating functions within government, as well as liaison with the cooperative movement, will be useful. 23. [Itis advisable that a single department or office assume central coordinating, focal and liaison functions, of which the following might be most important: elaboration of a single national comprehensive policy in respect of cooperatives, formulation of guidelines for consistent execution throughout government, including monitoring and review of that execution; collaboration with legal departments in ing the general and any special laws; and liaison, consultation and collaboration with the cooperative movement. 24. The most effective organizational location for the responsible entity would be within a department already charged with broad strategic and coordinating functions, such as the A/C.3/54/L.11 office of a prime minister or president, or that responsible for economic management of development planning. 25. Aninstitutional arrangement appropriate to specific national conditions, which would permit effective collaboration between Governments and the cooperative, movement would be valuable. 26. Liaison between intergovernmental programmes and the international cooperative movement should be supported, including, in particular, that achieved through the Committee for the Promotion and Advancement of Cooperatives.",10/08/1999,1999_287246,Morocco,N/A,yes

an increasing economic cost for Governments, also threatens the national security and sovereignty of States, as well as the dignity and hope of millions of people and their families, and causes irreparable loss of human lives, Concerned that demand for, production of and trafficking in illicit drugs and psychotropic substances continue to seriously threaten the socio-economic and political systems, stability, national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States, especially those involved in conflicts and wars, and that trafficking in drugs could make conflict resolution more difficult, Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug-trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money-laundering and illicit traffic in arms, precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing the need for international

and balanced approach with strategies, measures, methods, practical activities, goals and specific targets to be met, that all States, the United Nations system and other international organizations

world drug problem in their programmes, taking into account the priorities of States, Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, can make an effective contribution to and should play an active role in addressing the world drug problem, Emphasizing the importance of the adoption of the Action Plan for the Implementation ofthe Declaration on the Guiding Principles of

use of drugs and at reducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse, ensuring that special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, particularly youth, and constitutes one of the pillars of the new global strategy and an important initiative of the United Nations Decade against Drug Abuse, 1991-2000, and reaffirming the need for demand reduction programmes, Emphasizing equally the importance of

production at a level consistent with licit demand, in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971,° Acknowledging that there are links, under certain circumstances, between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production, Stressing that respect for all human rights is and must be

A/C.3/54/L.20 (i) To working closely with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme to develop action-oriented strategies to assist in the implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction; (iii) To establishing the year 2003 as a target date for new or enhanced drug demand reduction strategies and programmes set up in close collaboration with public health, social welfare and law enforcement authorities; (iv) To achieving significant and measurable results in the field of demand reduction by 2008; (b) Called upon all States to report biennially to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on their efforts to meet the above-mentioned goals and targets for the years 2003 and 2008. 2. The present Action Plan is offered as guidance to Member States in implementing the above-mentioned commitments. Organizations of the United Nations system,? other international organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations are invited to provide support to Member States in implementing the Action Plan, according to their available resources, specific mandates and the different roles that they are to play in achieving the goals set out in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction. 3. The Action Plan reflects the emphasis in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction on the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach involving demand reduction and supply reduction, each reinforcing the other, together with the appropriate application of the principle of shared responsibility. It stresses the need for services responsible for prevention, including law enforcement agencies, to transmit the same message and use similar language. 4. The Action Plan is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.?! It allows for flexible approaches to reflect social, cultural, religious and political differences, and it acknowledges that efforts to reduce illicit drug demand are at different levels of implementation in different countries. 5. The Action Plan recognizes that progress to reduce the demand for illicit drugs should be seen in the context of the need for programmes to reduce the demand for substances of abuse. Such programmes should be integrated to promote cooperation between all concerned, should include a wide variety of appropriate interventions, should promote health and social well-being among individuals, families and communities, and should reduce the adverse consequences of drug abuse for the individual and for society as a whole. 6. The Action Plan focuses on the need to design demand reduction campaigns and programmes to meet the needs of the population in general, as well as those of specific population groups, taking into account differences in gender, culture and education and 20 This may include, but is not restricted to, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, the Joint United Nations Programme on Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the International Labour Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Health Organization, as well as international financial institutions such as the World Bank. 2!

(b) To facilitate the process of considering annual national inventories and national inventories included in national communications. including the preparation of technical analysis and synthesis documentation: and (¢) To facilitate the process of verification and technical assessment and expert review of the inventory intormation. B. Principles and definitions 2. National greenhouse gas inventories. reterred to below only as inventories. should be transparent. consistent. comparable. complete and accurate. 3. [nventories should be prepared using comparable methodologies agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties (COP). as indicated in paragraph 7 below. and any good practices' agreed upon by the COP at a future session. In the context of these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories: Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory ' The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is currently developing guidance on good practices as part of its work related to uncertainties in inventories. This guidance may be available for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) in 2000. Guidance on good practices may include. inter aliu, advice on the choice of methodology. emission factors, activity data, and uncertainties, and on a series of quality assessment and quality control procedures which may be applied during the preparation of inventories. should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the process for the communication and consideration of information: Consistency means that an inventory should be internally consistent in all its elements with inventories of other years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks. Under certain circumstances referred to in paragraphs 10 and 11, an inventory using different methodologies for different years can be considered to be consistent if it has been recalculated in a transparent manner. taking into account any good practices; ' Comparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by Parties in inventories should be comparable among Parties. For this purpose, Parties should use the methodologies and formats agreed by the COP for estimating and reporting inventories. The allocation of different source/sink categories should follow the split of the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. at the level of its summary and sectoral tables. Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks. as well as all gases, included in the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas [nventories, as well as other existing relevant source/sink categories which are specitic to individual Parties. and therefore may not be included in the [IPCC Guidelines. Completeness also means full geographic coverage of sources and sinks of a Party .’ Accuracy is a relative measure of the exactness of an emission or removal estimate. Estimates should be accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over or under true emissions or removals. as far as can be judged. and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Appropriate methodologies conforming to guidance on good practices should be used to promote uccuracy in inventories. C. Scope 5. These UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories cover the estimation and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals of both annual inventories and inventories included in national communications, as specified by decision 11/CP.4 and other relevant ‘decisions of the COP. D. Base vear 5 > According to the instruments of ratification. acceptance. approval or accession of the Convention by a given Party. 6. The vear 1990 should be the base year for the estimation and reporting of inventories. According to the provisions of Article 4.6 of the Convention and decisions 9/CP.2 and 11/CP 4. the tollowing Annex I Parties that are undergoing the process of transition to a market economy. are allowed to use a base vear or a period of years other than 1990. as follows: to use 1988 to use the average of the years 1985 to 1987 to use 1988 to use 1989 to use 1986 Bulgaria: Hungary: Poland: Romania: Slovenia: E. Methods Methodologv 7. Parties shall use the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. referred to below as the IPCC Guidelines, to estimate and report on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In accordance with the TPCC Guidelines. Parties may use different methods (tiers) included in those guidelines. giving priority to those methods which are believed to produce the most accurate estimates, depending on the data available. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. Parties can also use national methodologies which they consider better able to reflect their national situation provided that these methodologies are compatible with the IPCC Guidelines and are well documented. 8. The IPCC Guidelines offer a default methodology which includes default emission factors and in some cases default activity data. As these default data. factors and assumptions may not always be appropriate for specitic national contexts. it is preterable that Parties use their own national emission factors and activity data. where available. provided that they are developed in a manner consistent with any good practices. and considered to be more accurate, and the reporting of the emission and removal estimates and their underlying data is transparent. Good practices 9. When preparing inventories. Parties should apply any good practices agreed upon by the COP, in order to improve transparency. consistency, comparability. completeness and accuracy. Recalculations 10. The purpose of all recalculations should be the improvement of accuracy and/or completeness. Recalculations have to ensure consistency of the time-series. The inventories of an entire time-series. including the base vear and all subsequent years for which inventories have been reported. should be estimated using the same methodologies. and the underlying activity data and emission factors should be obtained and used in a consistent manner. Where the methodology or manner in which underlying activity data and emission factors are gathered has changed. Parties should recalculate inventories for the base and subsequent years. 1. However, in some cases activity data may be missing for some historical years, including the base vear. In this case, emissions or removals for these years may need to be recalculated with alternative methodologies. In these instances, Parties should demonstrate that the time- series is consistent. The alternative methodologies should be documented in a transparent manner. taking into account any good practices. Uncertainties 12, Parties should estimate the uncertainties of their inventories using the best methodologies available to them, taking account of any good practices. F. Reporting 1. General guidance Estimates of emissions and removals 3. Article 12.1(a) of the Convention requires that each Party shall communicate to the COP. through the secretariat. inter alia. a national inventory of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Ata minimum. inventories shall contain information on the following six greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO.). methane (CH,). nitrous oxide (N,O). pertluorocarbons (PFCs). hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). and sulphur hexatluoride (SF,). Parties should report emissions and removals of any other greenhouse gases whose 100-year global warming potential (GWP) values have been identitied by the IPCC and adopted by the COP. Parties should also provide information on the following indirect greenhouse gases: carbon monoxide (CO). nitrogen oxides {NO,) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Parties are encouraged to provide information on sulphur oxides (SO,). 14. Greenhouse gas emissions and removals should be presented on a gas-by-gas basis in units of mass with emissions by sources listed separately from removals by sinks. except in cases where it may be technically impossible to separate information on sources and sinks in the areas of land-use. land-use change and forestry. For HFCs and PFCs. emissions should be reported for each relevant chemical in the category on a disaggregated basis except in cases where paragraph 19 applies. 15. In addition. consistent with decision 2/CP.3. Parties should report aggregate emissions and removals of greenhouse gases. expressed in CO, equivalent terms at summary inventory level.” using GWP values provided by the IPCC in its Second Assessment Report, referred to below as 1995 IPCC GWP values, based on the effects of greenhouse gases over a 100-year time horizon. A list of these values is given in table 1 at the end of this document. Table 1 will be amended to include any additional greenhouse gases and their 100-year GWP values. once the GWP values have been adopted by the COP. 16. Consistent with decision 2/CP.3. Parties should report actual emissions of HFCs. PFCs and SF,, where data are available. providing disaggregated data by chemical (for example. HFC-134a) and source category in units of mass and in CO, equivalents. Parties should make every effort to develop the necessary sources of data for reporting actual emissions. For the source categories where the concept of potential emissions applies. and Parties do not yet have the necessary data to calculate actual emissions. Parties should report disaggregated potential emissions. Parties reporting actual emissions should also report potential emissions for the sources where the concept of potential emissions applies. for reasons of transparency and comparability. 17. Parties are strongly encouraged to also report emissions and removals of greenhouse gases for which 100-year GWP values are available, but not yet adopted by the COP. These emissions and removals should be reported separately from national totals. The GWP value and reference should be indicated. 18. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. international aviation and marine bunker fuel emissions. based upon fuel sold to ships or aircraft engaged in international transport. should not be included in national totals. but reported separately. Parties should also report emissions from international aviation and marine bunker fuels as two separate entries in their inventories. 19. Emissions and removals should be reported on the most disaggregated level of each source/sink category. taking into account that a minimum level of aggregation may be required to protect confidential business and military information. 3 CO. equivalent emissions should be provided at a level of disaggregation similar to summary table 7A of the IPCC Guidelines. Recalculations 20. Recalculations of previously submitted estimates of emissions and removals as a result of changes in methodologies, changes in the manner in which emission factors and activity data are obtained and used or the inclusion of new sources or sinks. which have existed since the base year but were not previously reported. should be reported for the base year and all subsequent years. up to the vear in which the recalculations are made. Recalculations should result in an improvement in the accuracy and completeness of the inventory and ensure the consistency of the time-series. In this regard, Parties should report justifications for these changes. The information on the procedures used for performing the recalculations, changes in the calculation methods. emission factors and activity data used. and inclusion of sources or sinks. should be documented in a transparent manner, indicating the relevant changes in each source or sink category where these changes have taken place. Completeness 21. Where methodological or data gaps in inventories exist. information on these gaps should be presented in a transparent manner. Parties should clearly indicate the sources and sinks not considered in their inventories but included in the IPCC Guidelines. and explain the reason for the exclusion. In addition. Parties should use the standard indicators presented below to fill the blanks in all the tables of an inventory. This approach facilitates assessment of the completeness of'an inventory. The standard indicators are as follows: () “NO™ (not occurring) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that do not occur for a particular gas or source/sink category within a country; (b) “NE™ (not estimated) for existing emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which have not been estimated. Where ""NE” is used in an inventory for emissions or removals of CO-, N-O. CH,, HFCs. PFCs, or SF,. the Party should indicate, using the completeness table of the common reporting format. why emissions could not be estimated: (c) “NA"" (not applicable) for activities in a given source/sink category that do not result in emissions or removals of a specific gas. If categories in the common reporting format for which “NA™ is applicable are shaded. they do not need to be filled in: (d) “[E™ (included elsewhere) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of ‘greenhouse gases estimated but included elsewhere in the inventory instead of the expected source/sink category. Where “IE” is used in an inventory. the Party should indicate. using the completeness table of the common reporting format, where in the inventory the emissions or removals from the displaced source/sink category have been included and the Party should give the reasons for this inclusion deviating from the expected category: =™ (confidential) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse [¢7 gases which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. given the provisions of paragraph 19 above: and (t) “0” for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which are estimated to be less than one half the unit being used to record the inventory table, and which therefore appear as zero after rounding. The amount should still be included in the national totals and any relevant subtotals.*’ In the sectoral background tables of the common reporting format Parties should provide data as detailed as methods allow. 22. If Parties estimate emissions and removals from country-specific sources or sinks, or of gases, which are not part of the IPCC Guidelines, they should explicitly describe what source/sink categories or gases these are. as well as what methodologies. emission factors and activity data have been used for their estimation. Verification® 25. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines. and for verification purposes, Parties should compare their national estimates of carbon dioxide emissions from fuel/ combustion with those estimates obtained using the [PCC reference approach. and report on them in annual inventories. Parties are also encouraged to report on any peer review of their inventory conducted nationally. Uncertainties’ 24, When reporting greenhouse gas emission and removal inventory data, the level of uncertainty associated with these data and their underlying assumptions should be indicated. The methodologies used for estimating uncertainties should be reported in a transparent manner. Parties are encouraged to report quantitative information on uncertainties where this is available. Adjustments Inventories are to be reported without adjustments related. for example. to climate (8] h work on guod practices and Parties should use any guidance which is subsequently agreed by the COP. With this procedure it is possible that sums of all sectoral tables will differ slightly from sums of summary tables because of rounding effects. ® The SBSTA may wish to consider this issue when more data are available or on completion of the development of guidance on good practices by the IPCC and. as appropriate. expand this section in any subsequent revisions to these guidelines. —] More rigorous requirements for reporting uncertainties may be adopted by the COP once the ongoing work of the IPCC on this matter is completed. variations or trade patterns of electricity. If Parties, in addition. carry out such adjustments to inventory data, they should be reported separately and in a transparent manner, with clear indications of the method followed. 26. Adjustments are regarded as important information in relation to the monitoring of emission and removal trends and the performance of national policies and measures. Individual Parties may choose whether adjustments are applied. in addition to reporting unadjusted inventory data. and if so. indicate which methods are chosen. Parties are further encouraged to share with others their experience with the application of adjustments. 2. Common reporting format 27. Parties shall submit annually to the Conference of the Parties, through the secretariat, the information required under the common reporting format as contained in the annex to these guidelines. This information shall be submitted on an annual basis for the last but one year prior to the year of submission, in accordance with paragraph 5. It should be formally submitted in both electronic form and hard copy. The common reporting format is part of the national inventory report referred to in section 3 below. 28. The common reporting format is a standardized format for reporting estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and removals and other relevant information. It will be provided to Parties by the secretariat and will also be available on the UNFCCC Web site. The common reporting format allows for the improved handling of electronic submissions and facilitates the processing of inventory information and the preparation of useful technical analysis and synthesis documentation. The common reporting format consists of: Summary and sectoral tables: (a) (b) Sectoral background data tables for reporting of aggregate emission factors and activity data; (¢) The [PCC worksheet 1-1 containing estimates of CO- emissions tfrom fuel combustion using the [PCC reference approach and a table for comparing estimates under this reference approach with national estimates. as well as providing explanations of any significant ‘difterences: (d) Tables for reporting. inter alia, aggregate CO, equivalent emissions and removals. recalculations. completeness of the inventory. uncertainty, feedstocks and non-energy use of fuels. international bunkers and multilateral operations. emission trends. and a check-list of the main inventory information requested by these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. 30. The common reporting format follows the source/sink category split of the IPCC sectoral tables. It provides a minimum set of information on methods. aggregate emission factors. and activity data. as well as relevant assumptions that underlie the estimates given in the sectoral tables. —J 31 The information provided by the common reporting format is aimed at enhancing the comparability and transparency of inventories by facilitating, inter alia, activity data and aggregate emission factor cross-comparisons among Parties. and easy identification of possible mistakes, misunderstandings and omissions in the inventories. 3. National inventorv report 32. Parties shall submit to the Conference of the Parties, through the secretariat. a national inventory report containing detailed and complete information on their inventories for all years from the base vear to the vear of the current annual inventory submission. in order to ensure the transparency of the inventory. 33. The national inventory report shall be submitted annually in its entirety to the Conference of the Parties. through the secretariat. in accordance with relevant decisions ot the COP, either as a printed document or electronically and should be updated annually to retlect changes. It should include: (a) The annual inventory information. submitted in accordance with paragraph 27, for all vears from the base vear® to the vear of the current annual inventory submission: (b) Calculation sheets’ or equivalent database information on detailed inventory calculations in each sector. for all vears from the base year to the year ot the current annual inventory submission. containing. inter «lia, disaggregated national emission factors and activity data underlying the estimates; (c) A description of the specttic methodologies and assumptions used in each sector, including an indication of the level ot complexity (IPCC tiers) applied and a description of any national methodology used by the Party. as well as information on anticipated future improvements in methodologies: Reterences or sources of information related to methodologies. emission factors (d) ¥ According to the provisions of Article 4.6 of the Convention and decisions 9/CP.2 and 11/CP.4. some Parties with economies in transition are allowed to use base years other than 1990, as mentioned in paragraph 7 above. national methods. and activity data. as well as the rationale tor their selection: (e) Information on assumptions and conventions underlying the emission and removal estimates, as well as the rationale for their selection; H Specific information on feedstocks and bunkers: With regard to possible double counting or non-counting of emissions, Parties should indicate whether feedstocks have been accounted for in the inventory, and if so. how they have been accounted for; (1) Regarding the reporting of emissions from bunker fuels, Parties should explain how they distinguish between domestic marine and aviation emissions, which are to be included in national totals, and international bunker emissions; (i1) (2) Information on any recalculations related to previously submitted inventory data, as requested in paragraph 20 above; Information on uncertainties, as requested in paragraph 24 above; (h) (1) Information on quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures implemented. N A separate section clearly identitying changes with respect to the previous years, including the changes in methodologies. sources of intormation and assumptions, as well as changes in response to the review process: 34. Parties shall publish their national inventory report. Parties may fulfil that obligation by keeping the national inventory report in its entirety on their national Web sites. G. Record keeping 35. Parties should gather and archive all relevant inventory information for each year. including all disaggregated emission factors. activity data and documentation about how these factors and data have been generated and aggregated for the reporting of the inventory. This ‘information should allow the reconstruction of the inventory. inter aliu, by the expert review teams. Inventory information should be archived from the base vear. including the corresponding data on recalculations applied. The paper trail should enable estimates of emissions and removals to be traced back to the original disaggregated emission tactors and activity data. This information should also facilitate the timely process of claritying inventory data when the secretariat prepares annual compilations of inventories or assesses methodological issues. Parties are encouraged to collect and gather the information in a single national inventorv tacility or to. at least, keep the number of facilities to a minimum. H. Systematic updating of the guidelines 36. Relevant future decisions. once taken by the COP. regarding the reporting of inventories under the Convention should be applied mutatis mutandis to these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on inventories, which will be updated accordingly. 1. Language 37. The national inventory report shall be submitted in one of the official languages of the United Nations.

Annex 1l to the decision COMMON REPORTING FORMAT (Annex to the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories) Notes on the common reporting format 1. This common reporting format consists of summary, reporting and overview tables from the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines). plus newly developed sectoral background tables. Users of IPCC software and of the software for converting from CORINAIR to [PCC formats should be aware that a few small additions have been made to the tables taken from the IPCC Guidelines. 2. Some sectoral background tables call for the calculation of implied emission fuctors. These are top-down ratios between the Party’s emissions estimate and aggregate activity data. The implied emission factors are intended solely for purposes of comparison. They will not necessarily be the emission factors actually used in the original emissions estimate, unless of course this was a simple multiplication based on the same aggregate activity data used to calculate the implied emission factor. 3. Consistent with the IPCC Guidelines. memo items. such as emissions estimates from international marine and aviation bunker fuels. should be reported in the appropriate tables, but not included in national totals. 4. Parties should use the documentation boxes provided at the foot of the sectoral background tables to improve clarity. 5. Parties should complete all cells calling for emissions or removals estimates. activity data or emission tactors. The tollowing standard indicators should be used where data are not entered. (a) “NO™ (not occurring) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that do not occur for a particular gas or source/sink category within a country: (b) “NE™ (not estimated) for existing emissions by sources and removal by sinks of greenhouse gases which have not been estimated. Where ""NE™ is used in an inventory for emissions or removals of CO.. N,O. CH,. HFCs. PFCs. or SF.. the Party should indicate. using the completeness table 9. why emissions could not be estimated: (c) “NA™ (not applicable) for activities in a given source/sink category that do not result in emissions or removals of a specific gas. [f categories in the common reporting format for which ""NA™ is applicable are shaded. they do not need to be filled in: (d) “IE” (included elsewhere) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases estimated but included elsewhere in the inventory instead of the expected source/sink categorv. Where ""IE” is used in an inventory. the Party should indicate using the completeness table 9. where in the inventory the emissions or removals from the displaced source/sink category have been included and the Party should give the reasons for this inclusion deviating trom the expected category:; (e) “C"" (confidential) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, given the provisions of paragraph 19 of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories; (f) “0” for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which are estimated to be less than one half the unit being used to record the inventory table, and which would therefore appear as zero after rounding. The amount should still be included in the relevant subtotals. In the sectoral background tables, Parties should provide data as detailed as methods allow. 6. Parties should complete the data in the additional information boxes. Where the information called for is inappropriate because of the methodological tier used by the Party. the corresponding cells should be completed using the indicator ""NA™. 7. Table 3 (the land-use change and forestry sectoral report) should be completed by Parties. The corresponding sectoral background tables 5 A-D follow the IPCC Guidelines and should be completed by Parties that use [PCC detault methods. The species and ecosystem types given in the background tables are examples and may be changed by Parties to better describe national circumstances. Parties which do not use the sectoral background tables 5 A-D should complete alternative formats. when they are available. 8. Neither the order nor the notation of columns. rows or cells should be changed in the tables because this will complicate data compilation. Any additions to the existing disaggregation of source and sink categories should be made using the spare rows and columns b= provided. Additional changes that are made should be clearly indicated both by using a red font and by underlining the information contained in changed cells. 9. Where recalculations of previously submitted data are necessary for the reasons set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories. Parties should - -complete recalculation table 8a for every vear from the base year, and table 8b. Parties should also complete the other tables of the common reporting format for the base year which have changed due to the recalculations.
