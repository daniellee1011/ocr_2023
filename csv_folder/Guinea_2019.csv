The text of resolution A/AC.109/2019/L.7, adopted at the 6th meeting without a vote, reads as follows: Decision of the Special Committee of 18 June 2018 concerning Puerto Rico The Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, Bearing in mind the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, contained in General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, Considering that more than half of the period 2011-2020, proclaimed by the General Assembly, in its resolution 65/119 of 10 December 2010, as the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, has concluded, Bearing in mind the 36 resolutions and decisions adopted since 1972 by the Special Committee on the question of Puerto Rico contained in the reports of the Special Committee to the General Assembly, in particular those adopted without a vote in recent years, Recalling that 25 July 2019 marks the 121st anniversary of the intervention in Puerto Rico by the United States of America, Noting with concern that, despite the rejection expressed by the majority of the Puerto Rican people on 6 November 2012 of their current status of political subordination, the political representatives of Puerto Rico and the United States have failed to set in motion a decolonization process that begins in Puerto Rico, in compliance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee on Puerto Rico, Noting that the consultation undertaken by the Government of Puerto Rico on 11 June 2017, in which, as reported by the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission, less than 23 per cent of voters participated, was not designed to promote decolonization in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), Noting with concern that the present political subordination of the Puerto Rican people impedes sovereign decision-making regarding the humanitarian crisis caused by the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which have aggravated the already serious economic and social problems, resulting in increased levels of poverty in Puerto Rico from 45 per cent to around 60 per cent of the population, which has caused mass migration and seriously affected efforts to achieve sustainable economic development, Also noting with concern that the United States Congress, invoking thereby its doctrine on plenary powers under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution, imposed in June 2016 a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (Fiscal Supervisory Board), appointed by the President of the United States to exercise plenary control powers over the elected executive and legislative officials of the Government of Puerto Rico in all issues relating to fiscal, economic and budgetary matters, as well as all that concerns the restructuring of the public debt of Puerto Rico, all of which aggravates the colonial situation in the country, Noting that the Supreme Court of the United States, in conformity with the request made by the Department of Justice, decided in June 2016 in the case of Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, that the original and ultimate source of governmental power in Puerto Rico lies in the United States Congress, and that any limited concession of 14/144 A/74/23 self-government to Puerto Rico may be unilaterally revoked by the United States Congress, Stressing again the urgent need for the United States to lay the groundwork for the full implementation of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto Rico, Noting the declarations by the Heads of State and Government of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Council of the Socialist International, which reiterate the inalienable rights of the people of Puerto Rico in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), and which also reiterate the Latin American and Caribbean character of Puerto Rico and their support for the resolutions on Puerto Rico adopted by the Special Committee, Noting also the debate in Puerto Rico on the search for a procedure that would enable the process of decolonization of Puerto Rico to begin, and aware of the principle that any initiative seeking a solution to the political status of Puerto Rico should originate from the people of Puerto Rico, and of the fact that, to date, several sectors have expressed that they are in favour of convening a constitutional assembly on status in Puerto Rico, Further noting the concern of the people of Puerto Rico regarding violent actions, including repression and intimidation, against supporters of Puerto Rican independence, that have come to light through documents declassified by federal agencies of the United States, Aware that Vieques Island (Puerto Rico) was used for over 60 years by the United States Marine Corps and naval forces to carry out military exercises, with negative consequences for the health of the population, the environment and the economic and social development of that Puerto Rican municipality, Noting the consensus among the people and the Government of Puerto Rico on the need to clean up, decontaminate and return to the people of Puerto Rico all the lands previously used for military exercises and installations, and use them for the social and economic development of Puerto Rico, as well as on the slowness of the process thus far, Also noting the constant complaints made by the inhabitants of Vieques Island regarding the continued bombing and the use of open burning as a clean-up method, thereby exacerbating the existing health and pollution problems and endangering civilian lives, Further noting that in the final document of the Seventeenth Summit Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Countries, held on Margarita Island (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), on 17 and 18 September 2016, and other meetings of the Non-Aligned Movement, the right of the people of Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence is reaffirmed under General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), the Government of the United States is urged to assume its responsibility to expedite a process that will allow the Puerto Rican people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence and to return the territory and occupied installations on Vieques Island and at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station to the Puerto Rican people, who constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation, and the General Assembly is urged to actively consider the question of Puerto Rico in all its aspects, Having heard statements and accounts representative of various viewpoints among the people of Puerto Rico and their social institutions, 15/144 A/74/23 Having considered the report of the Rapporteur of the Special Committee on the implementation of the resolutions concerning Puerto Rico, ! 1. Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to self- determination and independence in conformity with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the applicability of the fundamental principles of that resolution to the question of Puerto Rico, and that the people of Puerto Rico constitute a Latin American and Caribbean nation that has its own distinct national identity; 2. Calls again upon the Government of the United States of America to assume its responsibility to promote a process that will enable the Puerto Rican people to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence, in accordance and in full compliance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) and the resolutions and decisions of the Special Committee concerning Puerto Rico, and to take decisions, in a sovereign manner, to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty, and the problems related to education and health, which have been aggravated by the ravages of Hurricanes Irma and Maria; 3. Notes with concern that, by virtue of the decision of the United States Congress, under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) which creates the Financial Oversight and Management Board, the already weakened area in which the prevailing regime of political and economic subordination in Puerto Rico operates is reduced any further; 4. Notes the broad support of eminent persons, governments and political forces in Latin America and the Caribbean for the independence of Puerto Rico; 5. Again notes the debate in Puerto Rico on the implementation of a mechanism that would ensure the full participation of representatives of all sectors of Puerto Rican public opinion, including a constitutional assembly on status with a basis in the decolonization alternatives recognized in international law, and aware of the principle that any initiative seeking a solution to the political status of Puerto Rico should originate from the people of Puerto Rico; 6. Expresses serious concern over the actions carried out against supporters of Puerto Rican independence, and encourages the investigation of those actions with the necessary rigour and with the cooperation of the relevant authorities; 7. Requests the General Assembly to consider the question of Puerto Rico comprehensively and in all its aspects, and to decide on this issue as soon as possible; 8. Urges the Government of the United States, in line with the need to guarantee the legitimate right of the Puerto Rican people to self-determination and the protection of their human rights, to complete the return of all lands occupied by its military forces in Puerto Rico territory, in particular installations on Vieques Island and in Ceiba, to the people of Puerto Rico, respect fundamental human rights, such as the right to health and economic development, and expedite and cover the costs of the process of cleaning up and decontaminating the areas previously used in military exercises through means that do not continue to worsen the serious consequences of its military activity in order to protect the health of the inhabitants of Vieques Island and the environment; 9. Takes note with satisfaction of the report prepared by the Rapporteur of the Special Committee, in compliance with its resolution of 18 June 2018;! ' A/AC.109/2019/L.13. 16/144 A/74/23 10. Requests the Rapporteur to report in 2020 on the implementation of the present resolution; including new developments relevant to a process of decolonization of Puerto Rico, in accordance with resolution 1514 (XV); 11. Decides to keep the question of Puerto Rico under continuous review. F. Consideration of other matters 31. Atits Ist meeting, on 21 February, the Special Committee adopted suggestions relating to the organization of its work put forward by the Chair and decided to include on its programme of work and timetable for 2019 items relating to the compliance of Member States with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and other resolutions on _ decolonization (see A/AC.109/2019/L.2). Question of holding a series of meetings away from Headquarters 32. Having regard to its programme of work for 2019, the Special Committee remained committed to its mandate to hold meetings away from Headquarters, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 1654 (XVI) and paragraph 3 (9) of resolution 2621 (XXV), by which the Assembly authorized the Committee to meet elsewhere than at Headquarters whenever and wherever such meetings might be required for the effective discharge of its functions. Pattern of conferences 33. Inaccordance with measures that it had taken previously, the Special Committee continued to ensure the effective utilization of the conference-servicing resources allocated to it, and the further reduction of its documentation requirements by circulating communications and information material by, as much as possible, electronic means. A list of the documents of the Committee in 2019 is contained in annex I to the present report. 34. In the conduct of all its meetings during 2019, the Special Committee closely followed the guidelines set forth in the resolutions of the General Assembly on the pattern of conferences, in particular resolution 67/237. By effectively organizing its programme of work and holding extensive informal consultations, the Committee was able to keep the number of its formal meetings to a minimum. Cooperation and participation of the administering Powers in the work of the Special Committee 35. In accordance with the provisions of relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the delegation of the administering Power, New Zealand, participated in the work of the Special Committee in 2019, during its plenary meetings at Headquarters. 36. Ina related context, the Special Committee, at its 3rd meeting, on 17 June, adopted a resolution on the question of sending visiting and special missions to Territories in which it called upon the administering Powers to cooperate or continue to cooperate with the United Nations by facilitating United Nations visiting missions to the Territories under their administration, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on decolonization (see chap.

At its 11th meeting, on 28 June, and at the recommendation of the Chair, the Special Committee authorized the Rapporteur to prepare, with the assistance of the Secretariat, the report on the Committee’s work at its 2019 session, incorporating all the resolutions and decisions adopted and the related proceedings of the Committee, and, once completed and approved by the Bureau, to submit it directly to the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, in accordance with established practice (see A/AC.109/2019/SR.11). 41. At its 12th meeting, also on 28 June, the representative of the Syrian Arab Republic requested information regarding the decision taken by the Special Committee at its 11th meeting concerning the preparation of its annual report to the General Assembly, noting what he considered to be a difference between the decision in question and paragraph 8 of A/AC.109/2019/L.2. The Chair said that the record of the decision, which had been made by consensus that morning by the Committee in accordance with long-standing and established practice, would be available in the Journal of the United Nations (see A/AC.109/2019/SR.12). G. Relations with United Nations bodies and intergovernmental, regional and non-governmental organizations 42. In connection with the Special Committee’s consideration of the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations, and in accordance with paragraph 21 of General Assembly resolution 73/105, the President of the Economic and Social Council and the Chair of the Committee continued to maintain close contact with regard to appropriate measures for the coordination of the policies and activities of specialized agencies in implementing the relevant resolutions of the Assembly (see E/2019/61).

The Special Committee also continued to monitor related developments in the Non-Self-Governing Territories, having regard to relevant provisions of article 15 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. H. Review of work 46. In ongoing efforts to find creative and innovative ways to enable better implementation of the mandate of the Special Committee, its Bureau maintained the practice of holding during the intersessional period informal consultations with the administering Powers and other stakeholders regarding the Non-Self-Governing Territories on the Committee’s agenda. Meetings were held with three administering Powers, namely France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, during which the discussions in that regard were centred on the situation in the Territories for which they were each responsible and aimed at promoting cooperation and partnership with them in addressing the decolonization prospects of those Territories, on a case-by-case basis. 47. On 15 January 2019, the Bureau met with the Secretary-General, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 73/123, in which he was requested to meet with the Bureau informally at least once a year to explore innovative ways of using his good offices to help advance the decolonization agenda, on a case-by-case basis. During the meeting, the Bureau shared with the Secretary-General recent initiatives and activities undertaken by the Special Committee, which were intended to galvanize the implementation of its mandate. The Bureau also briefed him on the Committee’s ongoing dialogue with the administering Powers and other stakeholders on issues pertaining to the Non-Self-Governing Territories. In response, the Secretary-General underlined his commitment to the decolonization agenda and reaffirmed the full support of the Secretariat for the work of the Committee. 48. The Special Committee also considered each of the 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories on its agenda and adopted resolutions or decisions on 16 of them (see chaps VIII-XI). In addition, the Committee continued its review of the list of Territories to which the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was applicable and, in that context, heard from the representatives of many concerned organizations regarding the situation of Puerto Rico (see paras. 23 and 28). 49. Furthermore, the Special Committee considered and adopted recommendations on information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter; the question of sending visiting and special missions to Territories; the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations; and economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Territories (see chaps.

On the question of the publicity to be given to the work of the United Nations in the field of decolonization, the Special Committee adopted a resolution on the dissemination of information on decolonization, which it recommended to the General Assembly for action at its seventy-fourth session (see chap. XIII, resolution XVIII). I. Future programme of work and activities envisaged for 20207 52.

XIII, resolution XIX), the Special Committee intends to continue in 2020 to seek suitable means for the immediate, full and speedy implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. 53. The Special Committee will continue to carry out the actions approved by the General Assembly regarding the Second and Third International Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism in all Territories that have not yet exercised their right to self-determination, including independence. In particular, the Committee intends to formulate specific proposals, on a case-by-case basis, to bring about an end to colonialism, in accordance with the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. 54. The Special Committee will maintain its efforts to examine the implementation by Member States of resolution 1514 (XV) and other relevant resolutions on decolonization. 55. The Special Committee will continue to examine the political, economic and social situation in the Non-Self-Governing Territories and recommend, as appropriate, to the General Assembly the most suitable steps to be taken to enable the populations of those Territories to exercise their right to self-determination, including independence, in accordance with the relevant resolutions on decolonization, including resolutions on specific Territories. 56. In 2020, the Special Committee will aim at developing and finalizing, in cooperation with the administering Power and the Non-Self-Governing Territory in question, a constructive programme of work, on a case-by-case basis, for the Territories, to facilitate the implementation of the mandate of the Committee and relevant resolutions on decolonization, including resolutions on specific Territories. 57. Inaddition, the Special Committee will continue to dispatch visiting and special missions to the Non-Self-Governing Territories, where applicable and in accordance with the relevant resolutions on decolonization, including resolutions on specific Territories. 58.
