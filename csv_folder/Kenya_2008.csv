A/C.3/63/L.42/Rev.1 22. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 23. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 24. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, both as an effective contribution to the expansion of agriculture and food production and, in particular in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 25.

III. A/63/L.43 Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, as a result of, inter alia, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, inadequate flag State control and enforcement, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures, inadequate regulatory measures, harmful fisheries subsidies and overcapacity, and noting the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2006, Noting the joint study by the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform, and

fisheries management organizations and arrangements, the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States, Concerned that some operators increasingly take advantage of the globalization of fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and make economic profits from those operations, which constitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities, Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications, Recognizing also that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing may give rise to safety and security concerns for individuals on vessels engaged in such activities, Welcoming cooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization, in particular in assisting States and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, Recognizing the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (“the Compliance Agreement”),° the Agreement and the Code for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag, and vessels flying their flag which provide

governance and promote their improved performance, Calling attention to the need for States, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to continue to develop and implement effective port State measures and schemes to combat overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the critical need for cooperation with developing States to build their capacity in this regard, taking note of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop a legally binding instrument on minimum standards for port State measures, Noting that the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization have adopted port State measures, to be applied by their members, which include prohibition of entry and use of port services, including landing and trans-shipment, to vessels identified by those regional fisheries management organizations as engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities and that those measures prevent and deter such activities, Concerned that marine pollution from all sources, including vessels and, in particular, land-based sources, constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, due to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary, Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, and therefore welcoming the adoption in 2007 of the Strategy for Improving Information on Status and Trends of Aquaculture and a plan for its implementation by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to improve knowledge and understanding of the

obligations and exercise their rights under international instruments, in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources, Recognizing the need for appropriate measures to minimize by-catch, waste, discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear and other factors, which adversely affect fish stocks and may also have undesirable effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States, and subsistence fishing communities, Recognizing also the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into fisheries conservation and management and, more generally, the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, and noting in this regard the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem,® the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations related to guidelines for the implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the importance of this approach to relevant provisions of the Agreement and the Code, as well as decision VII/117 and other relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the

species, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the fact that some are threatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999, in providing guidance on the development of such measures, Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant subregional and regional fisheries Management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, while noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking, that only a small number of countries have implemented the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries, Expressing concern that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, and emphasizing that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, Expressing concern also over reports of continued losses of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality in 6 E/CN.17/2002/PC.2/3, annex. 7 See UNEP/CBD/COP/7/21, annex.
