Underlines the urgent need to establish an equitable, transparent and democratic international system to strengthen and broaden the participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting; 13.

Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7.

Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 1° 14.

Requests all States and private actors, as well as_ international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 18. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 12 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the Conference of FAO, Thirty-first Session, Rome, 2-13 November 2001 (C 2001/REP), appendix D.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 25. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 26. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 27.

A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 Reaffirming the importance of gender mainstreaming across the United Nations system, including in relation to the girl child, Recognizing that chronic poverty remains the single biggest obstacle to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate it, and noting that the burden of the global financial and economic crisis, the energy crisis, the food crisis and the continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those depending on income from the informal sector, and particularly by women and girls, Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing further that progress has been made in the passage of national legislation that affirms the equality of girls and boys and that corresponding measures have not been taken to effectively implement such legislation, and recognizing the continuing existence of discrimination against women and girls throughout the world and that addressing this situation will require additional efforts to strengthen policy implementation, including through international cooperation, Recognizing that the empowerment of and investment in girls which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes, and active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms reinforcing the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls, is under- recognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded because of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition and physical and mental health care, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful traditional practices, such as female infanticide, child and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned that child and forced marriages expose young married girls to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often lead to early childbearing and increase the risk of disability, stillbirth and maternal death, and reduce their opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and violate and impair the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls, Deeply concerned also that early pregnancy and early childbearing and limited access to sexual reproductive health care, including in the area of skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care, cause high prevalences of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and childbirth which often lead to death, particularly for young women and girls, Recognizing that progress towards ending child and forced marriages can have a positive impact on indicators related to girls’ education, maternal health and child health, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child and forced marriages are still underreported and recognizing that this requires further attention, Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation by 2010, set out in the document entitled “A world fit for children”, remains unmet, Deeply concerned further that, in situations of poverty, war and armed conflict, girl children are among those most affected and furthermore become the victims of sexual violence, abuse and exploitation and sexually transmitted infections and diseases, including HIV and AIDS, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Emphasizing that increased access to education for young people, especially girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases, in particular HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases, Recognizing that early childbearing continues to be an impediment to the improvement of the educational and social status of girls in all parts of the world and that, overall, child and forced marriages and early motherhood can severely curtail their educational opportunities and are likely to have a long-term, adverse impact on their employment opportunities and on their and their children’s quality of life, Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and can be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and limitation or denial of their human rights, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination, including in respect of their access to education and employment, and the importance of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this regard, Noting with concern that in some parts of the world, men outnumber women as a result, in part, of harmful attitudes and practices, such as female genital mutilation, son preference, which results in female infanticide and prenatal sex selection, early marriage, including child marriage, violence against women, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and discrimination against girls in food allocation and in other practices related to health and well-being, with the result that fewer girls than boys survive into adulthood, Deeply concerned that the phenomenon of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, is becoming a serious social problem, Deeply concerned also that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, erosion of the extended family, exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase of child-headed households, Recognizing that women and girls bear the disproportionate burden of caring for and supporting those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this impacts negatively on girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, 1. Stresses the need for full and urgent implementation of the rights of the girl child as provided to her under human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,’ the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? and the Optional Protocols thereto‘ as a matter of priority; 2. Urges all States that have not yet signed and ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 3. Urges all Governments and the United Nations system to strengthen efforts bilaterally and with international organizations and private sector donors in order to achieve the goals of the World Education Forum, ‘® in particular that of eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, which have not been fully met, and to implement the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative as a means of reaching this goal, and calls for the implementation of and reaffirms the commitments contained in the Education for All goals and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to gender and education; 4. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not 18 See United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Final Report of the World Education Forum, Dakar, Senegal, 26-28 April 2000 (Paris, 2000). A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 receive formal education, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurial training for young women and to tackle male and female stereotypes in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment and decent work; 5. Encourages States to promote the development of gender-sensitive curricula for educational programmes at all levels and take concrete measures to ensure that educational materials portray women and men, youth, girls and boys in positive and non-stereotypic roles, particularly in the teaching of scientific and technological subjects, in order to address the root causes of segregation in working life; 6. Calls upon States and the international community to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children, and ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion, and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families; 7. Calls upon States, with the support of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, as appropriate, to develop policies and programmes, giving priority to formal and informal education programmes, including age-appropriate sex education, with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, that support girls and enable them to acquire knowledge, develop self-esteem and take responsibility for their own lives, and to place special focus on programmes to educate women and men, especially parents, about the importance of girls’ physical and mental health and well-being, including the elimination of discrimination against girls in child and forced marriages; 8. Calls upon all States and international and non-governmental organizations, individually and collectively, to implement further the Beijing Platform for Action,’ in particular the strategic objectives relating to the girl child, and the further actions and initiatives to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,!9 and to mobilize all necessary resources and support in order to achieve the goals and strategic objectives and actions set out in the Beijing Declaration"" and Platform for Action; 9. Calls upon all States to take measures to address the obstacles that continue to affect the achievement of the goals set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action, as contained in paragraph 33 of the further actions and initiatives, where appropriate, including the strengthening of national mechanisms to implement policies and programmes for the girl child and, in some cases, to enhance coordination among responsible institutions for the realization of the human rights of girls, as indicated in the further actions and initiatives; 10. Urges States to strengthen efforts to urgently eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and girls, and, where applicable, to remain dedicated A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 to the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto;?° 11. Also urges States to fulfil the pledges that they made at the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls; 12. Further urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, deprived of nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-care services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, while a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is most threatening and harmful to the girl child, leaving her unable to enjoy her rights, to reach her full potential and to participate as a full member of society; 13. Urges States to ensure that the applicable requirements of the International Labour Organization for the employment of girls and boys are respected and effectively enforced and that girls who are employed have equal access to decent work, and equal payment and remuneration, are protected from economic exploitation, discrimination, sexual harassment, violence and abuse in the workplace, are aware of their rights and have access to formal and non-formal education, skills development and vocational training, and also urges States to develop gender-sensitive measures, including national action plans, where appropriate, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, including commercial sexual exploitation, slavery-like practices, forced and bonded labour, trafficking and hazardous forms of child labour; 14. Recognizes the importance of strengthening health systems, in particular primary health care and the need to integrate the HIV response into it, and notes that weak health systems, which already face many challenges, including a lack of trained health workers and insufficient retention of skilled health workers, are among the biggest barriers to accessing health care; 15. Calls upon States, with the support of relevant stakeholders including the private sector, civil society, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, as appropriate, to take all measures necessary to ensure the right of girls to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health, and to develop sustainable health systems and social services; 16. Urges all States to promote gender equality and equal access to basic social services, such as education, nutrition, birth registration, health care, including sexual and reproductive health, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the major causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream a gender perspective in all development policies and programmes, including those relating to children as well as those specific to the girl child; 17. Calls upon States, with the support of international organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and the media, to take appropriate measures to address the root factors of child and forced marriages, A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 including by undertaking educational activities to raise awareness regarding the negative aspects of such practices; 18. Urges all States to enact and strictly enforce laws to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses, and, in addition, to enact and strictly enforce laws concerning the minimum legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage and raise the minimum age for marriage where necessary, and to develop and implement comprehensive policies, plans of action and programmes for the survival, protection, development and advancement of the girl child in order to promote and protect the full enjoyment of her human rights and to ensure equal opportunities for girls, including by making such plans an integral part of her total development process; 19. Urges States to ensure that efforts to implement legislation to end child and forced marriages engage all stakeholders and agents of change and ensure that the information on the legislation against the practice is well known and generates social support for the enforcement of such laws and legislation; 20. Calls upon States to support community workshops and discussion sessions, to enable communities to collectively explore ways to prevent and address child and forced marriages, provide information through stakeholders who are credible to the community, such as medical personnel, and local, community and religious leaders, regarding the harm associated with these marriages, give greater voice to girls, and ensure consistence of message throughout the entire community, and to encourage the much-needed strong engagement of men and boys; 21. Also calls upon States to support and implement, including with dedicated resources, multisectoral policies and programmes that end the practice of child and forced marriages and ensure the provision of viable alternatives and institutional support, especially educational opportunities for girls, with an emphasis on keeping girls in school through post-primary education, including those who are already married or pregnant, ensuring physical access to education, including by establishing safe residential facilities, increasing financial incentives to families, promoting the empowerment of girls, improving educational quality, and ensuring safe and hygienic conditions in schools; 22. Further calls upon States to strengthen research, data collection and analysis on the girl child, disaggregated by sex, age and geographical location, in order to provide a better understanding of the situations of girls, especially of the multiple forms of discrimination that they face, and to develop necessary policies and programme responses, which should take a holistic approach to addressing the full range of the forms of discrimination that girls may face, in order to protect their rights effectively; 23. Urges States to take all necessary measures to ensure the full enjoyment by girls with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, and to adopt, implement and strengthen appropriate policies and programmes designed to address their needs; 24.

Urges States to formulate comprehensive, miultidisciplinary and coordinated national plans, programmes or strategies to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, which should be widely disseminated and should provide targets and timetables for implementation, as well as effective domestic enforcement procedures through the establishment of monitoring mechanisms involving all parties concerned, including consultations with women’s organizations, giving attention to the recommendations relating to the girl child of the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on violence against children; 28. Also urges States to ensure that the right of children to express themselves and to participate in all matters affecting them, in accordance with their age and maturity, is fully and equally enjoyed by girls; 29. Further urges States to involve girls, including girls with special needs, and their representative organizations, in decision-making processes, as appropriate, and to include them as full and active partners in identifying their own needs and in developing, planning, implementing and assessing policies and programmes to meet those needs; 30. Recognizes that a considerable number of girl children are particularly vulnerable, including orphans, children living on the street, internally displaced and refugee children, children affected by trafficking and sexual and economic exploitation, children living with or affected by HIV and AIDS, and children who are incarcerated who live without parental support, and therefore urges States, with the support of the international community, where relevant, to take appropriate measures to address the needs of such children by implementing national policies and strategies to build and strengthen governmental, community and family capacities to provide a supportive environment for such children, including by providing appropriate counselling and psychosocial support, and ensuring their enrolment in school and access to shelter, good nutrition and health and social services on an equal basis with other children; 31.

Requests the Secretary-General, as Chairman of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, to ensure that all organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, individually and collectively, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the World Health Organization, the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Labour Organization, take into account the rights and the particular needs of the girl child in country programmes of cooperation in accordance with national priorities, including through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework; 39. Requests all human rights treaty bodies and the human rights mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, including the special procedures, to adopt regularly and systematically a gender perspective in the implementation of their mandates and to include in their reports information on the qualitative analysis of violations of the human rights of women and girls, and encourages the strengthening of cooperation and coordination in that regard; 40. Requests States to ensure that, in all policies and programmes designed to provide comprehensive HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support, particular attention and support are given to the girl child at risk, living with or affected by HIV, including pregnant girls and young and adolescent mothers and girls with disabilities, with a view to achieving Millennium Development Goal 6, in particular to halt and begin to reverse by 2015 the spread of HIV; 41.
