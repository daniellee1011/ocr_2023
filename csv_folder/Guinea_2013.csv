Historical background 1. The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) was established at the initiative of the Republic of Korea, with a vision of shifting the current development paradigm of quantity-oriented, fossil-fuel-dependent growth to quality-oriented and sustainable economic growth. In the new paradigm, green economy and green growth are dynamic tools to achieve sustainable development, addressing the economic, environmental and social pillars in a balanced way and with a strong focus on implementation. The Institute originated as an amalgamation of ideas from the public and private sectors committed to helping developing countries on the transition towards a low-carbon, inclusive and sustainable economic growth path. 2. The Institute was initially formed as a non-profit foundation under the domestic laws of the Republic of Korea in May 2010 and became an international organization when the Agreement on the Establishment of the Global Green Growth Institute was signed in June 2012 and entered into force in October 2012. 3. Membership in the Institute is, in accordance with article 5 of the Agreement, open to any Member State of the United Nations as well as to regional integration organizations. 4. As of June 2013, the Institute had 20 member States. The Institute is headquartered in Seoul and has branch offices in Copenhagen, Abu Dhabi and London. IJ. The instrument establishing the Global Green Growth Institute 5. The Agreement that established the Global Green Growth Institute was signed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 20 June 2012 by the Commonwealth of Australia, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of Costa Rica, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, the Republic of Kiribati, the Kingdom of Norway, the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Paraguay, the State of Qatar, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 6. The Agreement was also subsequently signed by the Republic of the Philippines, on 21 June 2012, the Republic of Indonesia, on 17 September 2012, the United Mexican States, on 12 October 2012, and Mongolia and the Republic of Rwanda, on 9 June 2013. The Agreement entered into force on 18 October 2012. III. Members 7. Currently, the following 20 countries are the member States of the Global Green Growth Institute: 3/10 A/68/191 Australia Cambodia Costa Rica Denmark Ethiopia Guyana Indonesia Kiribati Mexico Mongolia Norway Papua New Guinea Paraguay Philippines Qatar Republic of Korea Rwanda United Arab Emirates United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Viet Nam IV. Purpose and function 8. Pursuant to article 2 of the Agreement, “[t]he GGGI shall promote sustainable development of developing and emerging countries, including the least developed countries, by: (a) supporting and diffusing a new paradigm of economic growth: green growth, which is a balanced advance of economic growth and environmental sustainability; (b) targeting key aspects of economic performance and resilience, poverty reduction, job creation and social inclusion, and those of environmental sustainability such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and securing access to affordable, clean energy, clean water and land; and (c) creating and improving the economic, environmental and social conditions of developing and emerging countries through partnerships between developed and developing countries and the public and private sectors.” 9. The Institute supports developing countries that seek to leapfrog the resource- intensive and environmentally unsustainable model of economic development pioneered in an earlier era by industrialized economies, by providing them with tailored and sustained programmes of technical and capacity-building assistance. In this way, the Institute assists developing countries in pursuing the green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, as an important tool for achieving sustainable development. 10. The Institute’s core activity is green growth planning and implementation, through which it provides expert technical assistance and capacity-building to developing countries and emerging economies. Currently, the Institute has green growth planning and implementation programmes in 18 developing countries, as well as 3 multi-country programmes. Through these programmes, the Institute supports developing countries and emerging economies in their development of green and inclusive economic development strategies, and their implementation of these strategies, including through financial analysis and public-private cooperation. 4/10 A/68/191 11. The Institute provides the best available analytical tools and helps build institutional capacity to apply them, through a tailored, consistent programme for partner countries based on specific national circumstances and_ priorities. Programmes are implemented in close cooperation with partner countries, including national, provincial and municipal authorities. The Institute maintains a presence on the ground to facilitate capacity-building and ensure full country ownership. 12. The Institute initiates its cooperation programmes on the basis of a high-level request from a developing country Government. The Institute’s approach is particularly suited to developing countries because its point of departure is inclusive and green economic growth, leading to broad-based progress in living standards and quality of life. 13. The scope of work for the Institute in a developing country depends on the country’s specific situation and development goals. Initially, and in close collaboration with the Government, the Institute conducts a comprehensive diagnosis of the country’s green growth potential and its internal and external challenges. The diagnosis involves assessing physical and socioeconomic conditions as well as the potential for aligning an inclusive green economy approach with the country’s development priorities. The next step establishes a green growth pathway, refines the policy options available and identifies the options for implementation, in particular financing and public-private cooperation. This includes actions in priority sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, water, transport and energy, according to the partner country’s specific circumstances and priorities. 14. Currently, the Institute cooperates with the following countries and provinces (in alphabetical order): (a) Africa: the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Republic of Rwanda and the Republic of South Africa; (b) Asia: the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of Indonesia, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Karnataka (Republic of India), the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Republic of the Philippines, the Kingdom of Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and Yunnan Province (in the People’s Republic of China); (c) Latin America and the Caribbean: the Federative Republic of Brazil, the United Mexican States and the Republic of Peru. 15. In addition, the Institute has multi-country programmes in the Amazon, Aral Sea and Mekong regions. A programme among small island developing States is under preparation. 16. In the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Institute supported the Government in establishing institutional and legal frameworks and elaborating a national green growth policy and strategy. The strategy identifies a number of specific actions, and currently the Institute is looking into how best to support their implementation. 17. In the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Institute supported the Government in developing a climate-resilient green economy plan. This included national strategies on climate resilience and green economy (low-carbon development), underpinned by scientific and economic analysis. Currently, the Institute is supporting the Government in implementing the green economy plan, including setting concrete targets across different sectors and regions and assessing 5/10 A/68/191 the policies required, taking into account barriers to implementation, to meet these targets. 18. In the People’s Republic of China, the Institute plans to assist Yunnan Province in pursuing green growth by developing a five-year green growth action plan in line with the national and provincial development plans. The Institute also focuses on selected sectoral projects and provides training to key stakeholders in order to build local capacity in green growth planning and implementation. 19. In the United Mexican States, the Institute and the Government have designed a jointly funded programme of collaboration that supports the federal Government in developing a climate-resilience plan aimed at reducing economic vulnerability, especially among the poorest populations. It is also developing proposals for public- private cooperation and creating South-South dialogue and knowledge transfer. 20. The Institute’s two other programmes — research and _ public-private cooperation — are designed to support the delivery of the green growth planning and implementation programmes, in particular the quality of the analytical and implementation support provided to the Governments of developing countries. This includes South-South and North-South knowledge-sharing. 21. The Institute’s research programme analyses the development of the green growth paradigm in developing countries by conducting research on green growth theory and practice. The focus is on areas where there is the greatest need for additional research, identified jointly with senior policymakers (e.g., chief economic advisers and finance, economy and planning ministries) and leading economists in developing and emerging countries. The main outcome is relevant, high-quality research that explores the potential of inclusive green growth and provides practical guidance to policymakers, especially in developing and emerging countries. 22. The research programme prioritizes the following topic areas as they apply to developing and emerging countries: green growth planning tools and methodology; lessons from in-country green growth planning experience; economic theory and policy of green growth; resource efficiency and green growth, including sectoral opportunities and approaches; technological innovation and green growth; employment and poverty reduction; social innovation and welfare; the political economy of green growth; and international economic cooperation and green growth. 23. Some of the Institute’s research is generated primarily by in-house researchers and draws heavily on the Institute’s green growth planning and implementation experience in developing and emerging countries. Other research is conducted in partnership with leading economic policy institutes and research centres in both developing and advanced countries, especially on more theoretical and technology- focused issues. 24. Among the initiatives carried out under the research programme which may provide useful inputs to United Nations processes are the Green Growth Knowledge Platform and the Green Growth Best Practices. In the Green Growth Knowledge Platform, the Institute cooperates with the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to create a global network of researchers and development experts with the aim of identifying and addressing major knowledge gaps in green economy and green growth theory and practice. The Platform provides policymakers 6/10 A/68/191 with the tools to facilitate the transition, and identifies and addresses major knowledge gaps in green economy theory and practice, in order to help countries design and implement policies to move towards a green economy. 25. The Green Growth Best Practices initiative conducts fact-based analysis of green growth best practices with a team of expert authors from all regions. The assessment results are documented and shared through handbooks, policy briefs, training materials, a website and other audience-tailored resources, as well as through policy dialogue workshops, outreach to countries, webinars and other learning forums. In this initiative, the Institute cooperates with the Climate and Development Knowledge Network and the European Climate Foundation. 26. The Institute’s public-private cooperation programme facilitates the engagement of the resources and expertise of the private sector, both domestically and internationally, in the implementation of green growth strategies in the Institute’s partner countries. 27. Through this programme, the Institute facilitates public-private cooperation by linking companies to developing country Governments that are seeking private sector finance, technology and expertise to accelerate the implementation of their green growth or green economy plans. The Institute connects the partner countries with potential private sector providers of capital and technology by developing specific investment plans in key sectors that help tap domestic and external, as well as public and private, sources of finance. 28. In addition, the public-private cooperation programme builds intra- and cross- industry programmes of cooperation, and links them to relevant intergovernmental processes, to expand markets in developing and emerging countries for resource- efficient products, services and industrial processes, and to facilitate technology transfer. The programme elevates the importance that political and business leaders attach to the role of public-private cooperation for implementation. 29. As part of the public-private cooperation programme, the Institute acts as a strategic partner of the Global Green Growth Forum, which is a_ high-level partnership of three developed countries (the Kingdom of Denmark, the Republic of Korea and the State of Qatar) and three developing countries (the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Kenya and the United Mexican States) that seeks to support the innovation and scaling-up of private sector engagement in various aspects of green growth. 30. In June 2013, in recognition of the sustainable benefits that the Institute has brought and will be able to bring to developing and emerging countries, the OECD Development Assistance Committee Working Party on Development Finance Statistics approved the addition of the Institute to the list of international organizations eligible for official development assistance. V. Governance bodies 31. The Institute’s governance structure consists of the Assembly, the Council and the Secretariat, whose functions are as follows: (a) The Assembly is composed of the members of the Institute and meets every two years. The functions of the Assembly include advising on the overall 7/10 A/68/191 direction of the Institute and reviewing the organization’s progress in meeting its stated objectives. The Assembly also elects Council members and appoints a Director General; (b) The Council serves as the executive organ of the Institute and thus approves the organization’s strategy, budget, admission of new members and criteria for its programmes; (c) The Secretariat acts as the chief operational organ of the organization and is headed by the Director General, who represents the Institute externally and provides strategic leadership for the organization in carrying out its objectives. VI. Observer status in the United Nations General Assembly 32. The Institute is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations process on sustainable development and the attainment of internationally agreed development goals. 33. The Institute and its members adhere fully to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. 34. As a new international organization with a focus on developing countries, the Institute contributes in a concrete way towards the objectives and frameworks established by the United Nations and other international bodies in the areas of sustainable development and poverty reduction, including Agenda 21; the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy; the Istanbul Programme of Action; the internationally agreed commitments related to Africa’s development needs; the Millennium Development Goals; the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation; and the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want” (General Assembly resolution 66/288, annex). 35. Consistent with, and in active support of, these United Nations frameworks, the Institute cooperates with developing countries and emerging economies to facilitate and implement the transition towards a green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, as defined and detailed in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. 36. Through its programmes, the Institute helps developing countries and emerging economies to achieve sustainable development through green economy policies, to integrate the green economy potential into their national development strategies and investment plans, and to mobilize national and international resources. 37. Developing countries sometimes lack the expertise to build “bankable” investment cases, leading to difficulties in attracting finance. The Institute helps fill this gap through its familiarity with the country’s green growth plan, the strategic relationship it builds with the Government in helping to design their plans, and its neutrality in the sense of not being a financing agency or bilateral cooperation partner. 38. Cooperation with the Institute makes partner countries ready to benefit from international funding sources which support investments in a green economy, including the Green Climate Fund and other climate financing mechanisms. 8/10 A/68/191 39. Granting the Institute observer status in the General Assembly would enable the Institute to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes, based on real-life experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. 40. The Institute can contribute valuable and innovative analytical inputs and knowledge to the United Nations by providing: (a) Best practice experience and tools for the implementation of green economy policies and legislation; (b) Macroeconomic and cross-sectoral analysis on the green economy, including impacts on poverty alleviation and productive employment; (c) Analysis of financial options, investment flows and market-based mechanisms, such as payment of ecosystem services; (d) Analysis on the green economy potential of key areas, such as energy, water, oceans and seas, agriculture, forestry, transport, tourism, urban development, and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and on cross-sectoral interlinkages, such as the water-food-energy nexus; (e) Models for involving businesses and industry in the green economy, including small and medium-sized enterprises, e.g., through public-private partnerships, innovation and technology transfer; and (f) Indicators for measuring progress towards a green economy. 9/10 A/68/191 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the Global Green Growth Institute in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Wishing to promote cooperation between the United Nations and the Global Green Growth Institute, 1.

B. 2/13 further recalling the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective across the United Nations system in relation to the girl child, Recalling the Secretary-General’s 2008-2015 campaign “UNiTE to End Violence against Women” and the call upon Governments, civil society, women’s organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire United Nations system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls, Taking note of the appointment by the Secretary-General of the first Envoy on Youth in line with the imperative, contained in his five-year action agenda, on “Working for and with women and young people”, Recognizing that chronic poverty remains one of the biggest obstacles to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children, including the girl child, Recognizing also that urgent national and international action is required to eliminate poverty, in particular extreme poverty, and noting that the ongoing effects of the global financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those headed by girls, Recognizing further that the phenomenon of child-headed households is linked to other economic, social and political realities, such as armed conflict, natural disasters, lack of economic empowerment and health inequities, and that a comprehensive approach to these problems is needed to resolve the issue of child- headed households, Deeply concerned about the serious social problem of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, and that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, the erosion of the extended family, the exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase in the number of child- headed households, Recognizing that child-headed households may result from the death of parents and/or legal guardians, and that children can become de facto heads of households owing to parental illness, whether physical or mental, parental neglect, the migration of parents or other such factors, Deeply concerned about the extreme vulnerability of children who are heads of households, particularly girls, who may be exceptionally negatively affected by the economic and care burdens placed on them at a young age, which in turn may lead to their having difficulty completing their education and increase their vulnerability to poverty, discrimination, trafficking and physical abuse, Deeply concerned also about the vulnerability of children, in particular the girl child, raised in child-headed households, who suffer from the lack of adult support and may be particularly vulnerable to poverty, mental and psychosocial trauma and physical vulnerability owing to, inter alia, food insecurity and poor nutrition, limited access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and communicable and non-communicable diseases, Deeply concerned further that children heading households may be subjected to stigma and discrimination owing to the fact that parental death is a result of 3/13 HIV/AIDS, and that children heading households may be at greater risk of HIV because of their vulnerability to violence and exploitation as they seek to support their households, Deeply concerned that, in situations of poverty, armed conflict, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies, the incidence of child-headed households increases and makes girl children particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, abuse, exploitation and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that an estimated 68 million girls?° are engaged in child labour and that many of them face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with domestic chores, which deprive them of their childhood and diminish their opportunities to benefit from education and decent employment in the future, Recognizing that the needs of girls vary, according to a number of factors, including their age, and that the risks of violence and discrimination that they face change over their life cycles, from childhood through adolescence, Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing further that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child, early and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the 20 International Labour Organization, Making progress against child labour — Global estimates and trends 2000-2012 (Geneva, 2013). 4/13 corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls is underrecognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded as a result of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Taking note with appreciation of the adoption by the Human Rights Council of its resolution 24/23 of 27 September 2013 entitled “Strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage: challenges, achievements, best practices and implementation gaps”, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and child birth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their employment opportunities and their and their children’s quality of life and violates and impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation in the next generation, as reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/146 of 20 December 2012, remains unfinished business, Stressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources and technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs and priorities of child-headed households and women and girls at risk of or subjected to child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, 5/13 Emphasizing that increased access to education for young people, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination, including in respect of their access to education, health- care services and employment, and the importance of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this regard, 1. Stresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of the girl child as provided to her under human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,’ the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,’ the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? and the Optional Protocols thereto‘ as a matter of priority; 2. Urges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)?! and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)?2 of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 3. Urges all Governments and the United Nations system to strengthen efforts bilaterally and with international organizations and private sector donors in order to achieve the goals of the World Education Forum?? and to implement the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative, and calls for the reaffirmation and implementation of the commitments contained in the Education for All goals and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to gender and education; 4. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education, including communications and technology education, where available, for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive formal education, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurial training for young women and to tackle male and female stereotypes in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment, equitable compensation and decent work; 5. Calls upon States and the international community to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children and ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, improving the safety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring all schools are accessible, safe, secure and free from violence, and providing separate and adequate sanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families and children who become heads of households; 23 See United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Final Report of the World Education Forum, Dakar, Senegal, 26-28 April 2000 (Paris, 2000). 6/13 6. Calls upon States, with the support of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, as appropriate, to develop policies and programmes, giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education programmes, including age-appropriate sex education, with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, that support girls and enable them to acquire knowledge, develop self-esteem and take responsibility for their own lives, and to place special focus on programmes to educate women and men, especially parents, about the importance of girls’ physical and mental health and well-being; 7. Urges States to acknowledge the different needs of girls and boys during their childhood and adolescence and, as appropriate, to make differential investments that are responsive to their changing needs; 8. Calls upon all States, the United Nations system and civil society to take measures to address the obstacles that continue to affect the achievement of the goals set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action,’ as contained in paragraph 33 of the further actions and initiatives, including reviewing remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls in order to modify or abolish them and, where appropriate, strengthening national mechanisms to implement policies and programmes for the girl child and, in some cases, to enhance coordination among responsible institutions for the realization of the human rights of girls, including abolishing laws that discriminate against women and girls, and to mobilize all necessary resources and support in order to achieve those goals; 9. Urges States to strengthen efforts to urgently eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and, where applicable, to remain dedicated to the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto;?4 10. Also urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, in particular extreme poverty, deprived of nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-care services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, while a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is particularly threatening and harmful to the girl child, leaving her unable to enjoy her rights, to reach her full potential and to participate as a full member of society, with a particular focus on children living in child-headed households, including the child head of household; 11. Further urges States to ensure that the applicable requirements of the International Labour Organization for the employment of girls and boys are respected and effectively enforced and that girls who are employed have equal access to decent work, and equal payment and remuneration, are protected from economic and sexual exploitation, discrimination, sexual harassment, violence and abuse in the workplace, are aware of their rights and have access to formal and non-formal education, skills development and vocational training, and also urges States to develop gender-sensitive measures, including national action plans, where appropriate, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, hazardous forms of child labour, trafficking and slavery-like practices, including forced and bonded labour, and to recognize that girls, including in child- headed households, face greater risks in this regard; 7/13 12. Calls upon States, with the support of relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society, non-governmental organizations and community- based organizations, as appropriate, to take all measures necessary to ensure the right of girls to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health, and to develop sustainable health systems, strengthen existing ones to ensure primary health care with an integrated HIV response and make them more accessible to adolescent girls; 13. Urges all States to promote gender equality and equal access to basic social services, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, birth registration, health care, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the major causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream a gender perspective into all development policies and programmes, including those specific to the girl child; 14. Calls upon States to strengthen the capacity of national health systems, and in this regard calls upon the international community to assist national efforts, including by allocating adequate resources in order to provide essential services needed to prevent obstetric fistula and to treat those cases that occur by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care, to adolescent girls, including those living in poverty and in underserved rural areas where obstetric fistula is most common; 15. Urges all States to enact and strictly enforce laws ending child, early and forced marriage and ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses, to enact and strictly enforce laws concerning the minimum legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage, to raise the minimum age for marriage, engage all stakeholders, where necessary, and ensure that these laws to end child, early and forced marriage are well known, to further develop and implement comprehensive policies, plans of action and programmes for the survival, protection, development and advancement of the girl child in order to promote and protect the full enjoyment of her human rights, and to ensure equal opportunities for girls, including by making such plans an integral part of her total development process; 16. Calls upon States to support and implement, including with dedicated resources, multisectoral policies and programmes that end the practice of child, early and forced marriage and ensure the provision of viable alternatives and institutional support, especially educational opportunities for girls, with an emphasis on keeping girls in school through post-primary education, including those who are already married or pregnant, ensuring physical access to education, including by increasing financial incentives to families, promoting the empowerment of girls, improving educational quality, ensuring safe and hygienic conditions in schools, and, where applicable, establishing safe residential facilities; 17. Urges States to ensure that the rights of children in child-headed households are respected and that the heads of such households have full enjoyment of all the rights of the child, and to further ensure that children in child-headed households, particularly girls, receive the support they need to ensure their continued attendance in school consistent with their age; 8/13 18. Also urges States to ensure that efforts to enact and implement legislation to protect, support and empower child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, include provisions to ensure their economic well-being, access to health-care services, nutrition, clean water and sanitation, shelter and education, and inheritance, and that the family is protected and assisted in staying together; 19. Calls upon States to put in place concrete measures to ensure that while children heading households, especially girls, exercise all the rights of the child, they also receive appropriate assistance to enable them to fulfil their de facto responsibilities as household heads by ensuring and protecting their property and inheritance rights; 20. Also calls upon States to include an integrated approach in supporting and empowering child-headed households, given the mental and psychosocial trauma, stigma and physical and economic stress children may experience as a result of becoming heads of households at a very young age; 21. Urges States to forge partnerships with relevant stakeholders, particularly by working with and involving communities in developing programmes and mechanisms designed to ensure the safety, protection and empowerment of children, especially girls, in child-headed households as well as to ensure that they receive the support they need from their community; 22. Calls upon States to strengthen research on families and household formation and structure, with a particular emphasis on the existence of de facto child-headed households and the long-term economic and psychological impact that being a child head of household or a child raised by another child has on the children and on social sustainability; 23. Also calls upon States to strengthen research, data collection and analysis on the girl child, disaggregated by household structure, sex, age, disability status, economic situation and marital status and geographical location, in order to provide a better understanding of the situations of girls, especially of the multiple forms of discrimination that they face, and to inform the development of necessary policies and programme responses, which should take a holistic age-appropriate approach to addressing the full range of the forms of discrimination that girls may face, in order to protect their rights effectively; 24. Urges States to take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment by girls with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, to adopt, implement and strengthen appropriate policies and programmes designed to address their needs, and to take into account the conclusions contained in the outcome document adopted at the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities, held on 23 September 2013; 25 25. Urges all States to enact and enforce legislation to protect girls from all forms of violence, discrimination and exploitation in all settings, including female infanticide and prenatal sex selection, female genital mutilation, rape, domestic violence, incest, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, child prostitution and child pornography, trafficking and forced migration, forced labour and child, early and 9/13 forced marriage, and to develop age-appropriate safe, confidential and disability- accessible programmes and medical, social and psychological support services to assist girls who are subjected to violence and discrimination; 26. Calls upon all States to enact and enforce the necessary legislative or other measures, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, including the private sector and the media, to prevent the distribution over the Internet of child pornography, including depictions of child sexual abuse, ensuring that adequate mechanisms are in place to enable reporting and removal of such material and that its creators, distributors and collectors are prosecuted, as appropriate; 27. Urges States to formulate comprehensive, miultidisciplinary and coordinated national plans, programmes or strategies to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, which should have dedicated resources, be widely disseminated and provide targets and timetables for implementation, as well as effective domestic enforcement procedures through the establishment of monitoring mechanisms involving all parties concerned, including consultations with women’s organizations, giving attention to the recommendations relating to the girl child of the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and of the Special Representative of the Secretary- General on Violence against Children; 28. Also urges States to ensure that children who are capable of forming their own views have the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting them, with the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, and ensure that this right is fully and equally enjoyed by the girl child, and to involve girl children, including those with special needs, as well as girls with disabilities, and their representative organizations in decision-making processes, as appropriate, and to include them as full partners in identifying their own needs and in developing, planning, implementing and assessing policies and programmes to meet those needs; 29. Recognizes that a considerable number of girl children are particularly vulnerable, including orphans, children living on the street, internally displaced and refugee children, children affected by trafficking and sexual and economic exploitation, children living with or affected by HIV and AIDS, and children who are incarcerated, or who live without parental support, and therefore urges States, with the support of the international community, where relevant, to take appropriate measures to address the needs of such children by implementing national policies and strategies to build and strengthen governmental, community and family capacities to provide a supportive environment for such children, including by providing appropriate counselling and psychosocial support, and ensuring their safety, enrolment in school and access to shelter, good nutrition and health and social services on an equal basis with other children; 30. Encourages States to promote actions, including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance, for the social reintegration of children in difficult situations, in particular girls, considering, inter alia, views, skills and capacities that those children have developed in the conditions in which they lived and, where appropriate, with their meaningful participation; 10/13 31. Urges all States and the international community to respect, promote and protect the rights of the girl child, taking into account the particular vulnerabilities of the girl child in pre-conflict, conflict and post-conflict situations, and in natural disasters as well as in other humanitarian emergencies, all of which may result in the creation of child-headed households, and further urges States to take special measures for the protection of girls, in all phases of humanitarian emergencies from relief to recovery, and in particular to protect them from sexually transmitted infections, including HIV infection, gender-based violence, including rape, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation, torture, abduction, trafficking and forced labour, paying special attention to refugee and displaced girls, and to take into account their special needs in disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation assistance and reintegration processes; 32. Deplores all cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of women and girls in humanitarian crises, including those cases involving humanitarian workers and peacekeepers, and urges States to take effective measures to address gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies and to make all possible efforts to ensure that their laws and institutions are adequate to prevent, promptly investigate and prosecute acts of gender-based violence; 33. Also deplores all acts of sexual exploitation, abuse of and trafficking in women and children by military, police and civilian personnel involved in United Nations operations, welcomes the efforts undertaken by United Nations agencies and peacekeeping operations to implement a zero-tolerance policy in this regard, and requests the Secretary-General and personnel-contributing countries to continue to take all appropriate action necessary to combat these abuses by such personnel, including through the full implementation without delay of those measures adopted in the relevant General Assembly resolutions based on recommendations of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations; 2° 34. Urges Member States, the United Nations and other international, regional and subregional organizations, as well as civil society, including non-governmental organizations, the private sector and the media, to fully and effectively implement the relevant provisions of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons?” and the activities outlined therein, and expresses its view that it will, inter alia, contribute to the promotion of the rights of girls and enhance cooperation and a better coordination of efforts in fighting trafficking in persons and promote increased ratification and full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime2® and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; ?9 35. Calls upon Member States to devise, enforce and strengthen effective child- and youth-sensitive measures to combat, eliminate and prosecute all forms of trafficking in women and girls, including for sexual and economic exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy within wider efforts to eliminate all 26 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-ninth Session, Supplement No. 19 (A/59/19/Rev.1). 11/13 forms of violence against women and girls, including by taking effective measures against the criminalization of girls who are victims of exploitation and ensuring that girls who have been exploited receive access to the necessary psychosocial support; 36. Calls upon Governments, civil society, including the media, and non-governmental organizations to promote human rights education and full respect for and the enjoyment of the human rights of the girl child, inter alia, through the translation, production and dissemination of age-appropriate and gender-sensitive information material on those rights to all sectors of society, in particular to children; 37. Requests the Secretary-General, as Chair of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, to ensure that all organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, individually and collectively, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the World Health Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Labour Organization, take into account the rights and the particular needs of the girl child in country programmes of cooperation in accordance with national priorities, including through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework; 38. Requests all human rights treaty bodies and the human rights mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, including the special procedures, to adopt regularly and systematically a gender perspective in the implementation of their mandates and to include in their reports information on the qualitative analysis of violations of the human rights of women and girls, and encourages the strengthening of cooperation and coordination in that regard; 39. Requests States to ensure that, in all policies and programmes designed to provide comprehensive HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support, particular attention and support are given to the girl child at risk, living with or affected by HIV, including pregnant girls and young and adolescent mothers and girls with disabilities, and child heads of households with a view to achieving Millennium Development Goal 6, in particular to halt and begin to reverse by 2015 the spread of HIV; 40. Invites States to promote initiatives aimed at reducing the prices of antiretroviral drugs, especially second-line drugs, available to the girl child, including bilateral and private sector initiatives as well as initiatives on a voluntary basis taken by groups of States, including those based on innovative financing mechanisms that contribute to the mobilization of resources for social development, including those that aim to provide further access to drugs at affordable prices to developing countries on a sustainable and predictable basis, and in this regard takes note of the International Drug Purchase Facility, UNITAID; 41. Calls upon all States to integrate food and nutritional support with the goal that children, especially girl children, have access at all times to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences, for an active and healthy life; 12/13 42. Calls upon States to ensure that social protection programmes, including HIV-sensitive programmes, are provided to orphans and other vulnerable children, with particular attention to addressing the needs and vulnerabilities of girl children and protecting their rights; 43. Urges States and the international community to increase resources at all levels, particularly in the education and health sectors, so as to enable young people, especially girls, to gain the knowledge, attitudes and life skills that they need to overcome their challenges, including the prevention of HIV infection and early pregnancy, and to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health; 44. Stresses the need to strengthen the commitment of States and the United Nations system in their responsibility to mainstream the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, in particular the girl child, into the development agenda at the national, regional and international levels, including in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; 45.
