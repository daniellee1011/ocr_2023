that they will never be produced again, Concerned also at the continued retention of the nuclear-weapons option by those three States that are nuclear-weapons-capable and that have not acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,' and concerned at their failure torenounce that option, Concerned further that negotiations on nuclear arms reductions are currently stalled,
