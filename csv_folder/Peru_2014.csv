Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics Principle 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a democratic society, serving the Government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social and environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be compiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens’ entitlement to public information. Principle 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly professional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and procedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data. Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics. Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs and the burden on respondents. Principle 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer to natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes. Principle 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be made public. Principle 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency and efficiency in the statistical system. Principle 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and methods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels. Principle 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of systems of official statistics in all countries. 2 For the original preamble used on the occasion of the initial adoption of the Principles in 1994, see the report of the Statistical Commission on its special session (E/1994/29), chapter V.

Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, Acknowledging that the right to food is the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate and culturally acceptable food that is produced and consumed sustainably, preserving access to food for future generations, Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming also that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming further that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also that the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to food is threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major factors, such as the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the lack of development in many countries and transfer of relevant technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island and vulnerable developing States, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in particular in the said countries, A/HRC/25/L.26 Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, Resolved to act to ensure that the full realization of all human rights, including the right to development, is taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in addressing the global food crisis, Recognizing the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including women farmers, family farmers and farmers in less favour areas, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing countries, Stressing the importance of reversing the substantial decline in assistance devoted to agriculture since 1980, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, while noting the recent partial inversion of this trend, Recalling the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails a sustainable increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, family farmers and farmers in less favoured areas, and groups in the most vulnerable situations, as well as national and international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable private and public investments in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want’, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 of 27 July 2012, Recognizing the ongoing inclusive consultative process within the Committee on World Food Security to develop voluntary and non-binding principles for responsible agricultural investments, intended for all stakeholders that are involved in, benefit from or are affected by those principles, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 do so from hunger-related illness, that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are chronically undernourished is about 842 A/HRC/25/L.26 million worldwide, and that an additional | billion people are suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and 98 per cent of undernourished people in the world live in developing countries; 5. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food- importing developing countries, especially on least developed countries; 6. Also expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to social protection and to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 8. Recognizes the importance of smallholder and subsistence farmers in developing countries, including women and local and indigenous communities, in ensuring food security, reducing poverty and preserving ecosystems, and the need to assist their development; 9. Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate into and effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective in their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 10. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 11. Encourages States to take steps with a view to progressively achieve the full realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms and to adopt national plans to combat hunger; 12. Underlines the significance of national government policies and strategies on food production, poverty alleviation and social protection; 13. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food, and encourages States to increase such cooperation as a complement to North-South cooperation and to promote triangular cooperation further; A/HRC/25/L.26 14. Recognizes the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, inter alia, traditional seed supply systems, including for many indigenous peoples and local communities; 15. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 16. Calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, paragraph 2, thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 17. Calls upon States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 18. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches; 19. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 20. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 21. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; A/HRC/25/L.26 22. Requests all States and private actors, and international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 23. Encourages all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security; 24. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 25. Takes note with appreciation of the growing movement, in different regions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and measures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all; 26. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 27. Calls for the early conclusion to and a successful, development-oriented outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution to creating international conditions permitting the full realization of the right to food; 28.

Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all stakeholders; 30. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty, 31. Recognizes that the commitments made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of people who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States and international financial and development institutions, as well as relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding for realizing the aim of halving by 2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from hunger, as stated in Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium Declaration; 32. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases; A/HRC/25/L.26 33. Calls upon all States and, if appropriate, relevant international organization to combat the different forms of malnutrition as a means to realize the right to adequate food, including, if appropriate, by adopting a national strategy in this regard; 34. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 35. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution to both the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, and the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities relating to emergency situations for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 36. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 37. | Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; 38. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in particular the Rome-based ones, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least developed countries; 39. Expresses concern at the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to adequate food of insufficient purchasing power and the increased price volatility of agricultural commodities on international markets, particularly on people in developing countries and on net food-importing countries; 40.

The guidelines for crime prevention and criminal justice responses with respect to trafficking in cultural property and other related offences have been developed in recognition of the criminal character of such offences and their devastating consequences for the cultural heritage of humankind. Pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 66/180 and 68/186 and Economic and Social Council resolution 2010/19, guidelines were developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in consultation with Member States and in close cooperation, as appropriate, with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and other competent international organizations. 2. The first of the guidelines was reviewed at an informal expert group meeting, held from 21 to 23 November 2011, composed of 20 experts from around the world, with expertise in various fields related to the subject matter of the guidelines, including representatives of INTERPOL, UNESCO and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit). Based on the valuable comments and advice on improving the , a second was presented to and discussed by the intergovernmental expert group on protection against trafficking in cultural property in its second meeting, held from 27 to 29 June 2012. Taking into account a compendium, prepared by the Secretariat, of comments made by Member States on the guidelines, the intergovernmental expert group reviewed and revised the guidelines at its third meeting, held from 15 to 17 January 2014, with a view to their finalization. 3. The guidelines are based on crime prevention and criminal justice aspects of protection against trafficking in cultural property, taking into consideration a review of current practices and initiatives in several countries in addressing the problem of trafficking in cultural property, as well as principles and norms arising from the analysis of the following international legal instruments: the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime of 2000; the United Nations Convention against Corruption of 2003; the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954; the First Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954; the Second Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1999; the Protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts of 1977 (Additional Protocol I); the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970; the Unidroit Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects of 1995 and the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage of 2001. 4. This set of non-binding guidelines is available to Member States for their consideration in the development and strengthening of crime prevention and criminal justice policies, strategies, legislation and cooperation mechanisms to prevent and combat trafficking in cultural property and related offences in all V.14-03266 situations.

the Kathmandu Declaration, adopted at the fifth South Asian Conference on Sanitation, in 2013; and the commitments made on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation at the Sanitation and Water for All High-Level Meeting, in 2014, Taking note with appreciation of the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2014 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Welcoming the fact that, according to the 2012 Joint Monitoring Programme report of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund, the Millennium Development Goal target relating to the reduction by 50 per cent of people without access to an improved water source was formally met five years before its deadline of 2015, while being deeply concerned, however, that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, a large number of the world’s population still does not enjoy access to safe drinking water, as 748 million people, nearly half of them in sub-Saharan Africa, still lack access to improved drinking-water sources, and that at least 1.8 billion people are estimated to be using an improved or unimproved drinking water source that is unsafe, Deeply concerned that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, more than 2.5 billion people still do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, including | billion people who still practice open defecation, and that the world remains off track to meet the sanitation component of Millennium Development Goal 7, which called for halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to an improved A/HRC/27/L.11/Rev.1 sanitation facility; and welcoming therefore the emphasis placed by States on the topic of sanitation, for instance in General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, in which States committed to, inter alia, redouble efforts to close the sanitation gap through scaled-up ground-level action, as well as the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of Sanitation for All, pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Concerned that the official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions as a critical part of securing access to safe drinking water as well as the safe management of sanitation, Reaffirming that non-discrimination and equality are fundamental human rights principles, and concerned that inequalities in the realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation persist, inter alia, between urban and rural areas and between formal and informal areas in cities, and insisting that much remains to be done on safety, equality and non-discrimination issues, Concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including menstrual hygiene management, and the widespread stigma associated with menstruation have a negative impact on gender equality and the human rights of women and girls, Recognizing that, in realizing the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights for a rapidly growing world population, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Recalling General Assembly resolution 67/291, entitled “Sanitation for All”, in which the Assembly encouraged all Member States, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including hygiene promotion, the provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage and wastewater treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management, Affirming the need to adequately consider the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while defining concrete goals, targets and indicators, Reaffirming its encouragement to Member States to intensify global partnerships for development as a means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation, Reaffirming also the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and A/HRC/27/L.11/Rev.1 affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity;

Recalls that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 3. Alarmed by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign “Sustainable sanitation: the five- year drive to 2015”, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 4. Welcomes the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals proposed in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater treatment, and that special attention be given to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, and invites States to consider adequately the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; 5.

the Human Rights Committee on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption, Recognizing the need for further discussion and in-depth study of issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age and to procedural safeguards, effective oversight and remedies, with a view to further practical guidance, grounded in international human rights law, on the principles of necessity, proportionality and legitimacy, Noting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, “NETmundial”, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 23 and 24 April 2014, taking note of the outcome of that meeting, which reiterated, inter alia, the need for human rights to underpin Internet governance and that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, and recognizing that effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology will require an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Noting also that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communication technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against

one of the foundations of a democratic society, Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to

data, and highlighting the need to further consider the linkages between mass surveillance and its effects on other human rights, 6 A/69/397. 7 A/HRC/23/40 and Corr.1. 2/4 Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, including data about communications, known as metadata, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, especially when undertaken on a mass scale, Noting that while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory and that any interference with the right to privacy must be necessary and proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims and not impair the essence of the right, Noting that surveillance, the interception of digital communications and/or the collection of personal data that involves a State’s exercise of power or effective control over communications infrastructure, regardless of its location, may engage its human rights obligations relating to the right to privacy, Emphasizing that the human rights obligations of a State regarding the right to privacy extend to the exercise of its regulatory jurisdiction over private parties that physically control data, regardless of their location, Recalling that private enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights and to prevent and address the adverse impacts of their activities on human rights, as set out, notably, in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, ® Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception

Special Rapporteur of the Council on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 7 Noting with appreciation general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption, ® Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, based on international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural

lawfulness, and the relevance of necessity and proportionality assessments in relation to surveillance practices, Noting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, “NETmundial”, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in April 2014, and recognizing that effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology will require an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Noting also that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communication technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her

surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken on a mass scale, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must undertake the necessary steps to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Emphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect
