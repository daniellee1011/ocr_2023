""' Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annexes I and II. Resolution 70/1. 2/10 Noting with concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls, but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Noting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of education are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic independence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women can expand their options for leaving abusive relationships, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls, Recognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and confronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the 3/10 importance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that respond to their specific needs, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict, public health emergencies and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Expressing deep concern about the unprecedented and multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of, and efforts to end, child, early and forced marriage, including the wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences and devastating impacts of the pandemic on the livelihoods of people and families, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, as well as the severe disruption to health and education systems, social protection programmes and the provision of protection and support services, including essential services, Noting with deep concern that these impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures are likely to increase risks faced by girls, including already married girls, as well as women affected by this practice, including risks 4/10 associated with sexual and gender-based violence, social isolation, unintended pregnancy, economic hardship, as well as the burden of unpaid care and domestic work and the associated risk of not returning to school, and difficulties in accessing health services, impeding the fulfilment of their rights and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian settings, Expressing deep concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates pre-existing root causes of child, early and forced marriage, but also threatens to divert international, regional and national attention and resources away from the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices, and that COVID-19 containment measures, including lockdowns, have resulted in delayed and diverted programme implementation and are disrupting efforts, including by civil society, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, Deeply concerned that these impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the factors contributing to child, early and forced marriage and on the efforts to prevent and reduce its incidence could result in at least 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that otherwise would have been averted by 2030, 1. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;” 2. Calls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, teachers, religious, traditional and community leaders, civil society, organizations led by girls, women’s organizations, youth and human rights groups, the media and the private sector, to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive and coordinated responses and strategies to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, to support girls and women who are affected or at risk, who have fled such a marriage or whose marriage has dissolved, and widowed girls or women who were married as girls, including through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection mechanisms such as safe shelters, access to justice and the sharing of best practices across borders; 3.

Calls upon States to strengthen their efforts to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, 5/10 procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages; 8. Also calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of and active consultation with children and adolescents, including already married girls, on all issues affecting them and to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, including in digital spaces, that provide information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, and lifelong learning opportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, to be empowered, to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities; 9. Further calls upon States to promote awareness-raising about the harmful effects of child, early and forced marriage on the individual and wider society and the benefits of ending this harmful practice, including through open dialogue with all stakeholders, including girls and boys, women and men, religious, traditional and community leaders, parents, legal guardians and other family members, to work with local communities to combat negative social norms and gender stereotypes that condone child, early and forced marriage, to empower parents and communities to abandon the practice and to empower all women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives; 10. Recognizes that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding and that parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child, acknowledging the need to support their capacity to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, and reaffirming that the best interests of the child will be their basic concern; 11. Urges Governments, while addressing child, early and forced marriage, to confront family poverty and social exclusion through investing in family-oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 12. Also urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, to tackle poverty, lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage, including by ensuring the rights of women and girls to inheritance and property, their equal access with men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, to encourage girls to continue their education, including through their re-enrolment in school after childbirth, to develop livelihood opportunities through access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills education, including financial literacy, and to promote freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as equal political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; 13. Encourages States to promote and protect the human rights of already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution and to address their specific needs, such as through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, increase their decision-making power, make it easier for them to seek formal employment, increase their economic independence and financial literacy, access education, skills development programmes and lifelong learning 6/10 opportunities, ensure their equal access to health-care services and information and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 14. Calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school, including because of marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, which empowers young women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education that is relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 15. Recognizes that education is one of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to help married women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives, and urges States to remove barriers to education, including by investing in quality primary and secondary education for every child in a safe environment, through adequate financing, ensuring that married girls and boys, pregnant girls and women and young parents continue to have access to schooling, improving access to quality formal education and skills development, especially for those living in remote or insecure areas, improving the safety of girls at and on the way to and from school, providing safe and adequate sanitation, including for menstrual hygiene management, adopting and implementing laws and policies to prohibit, prevent and address violence and to hold perpetrators accountable, strengthening and intensifying their efforts to implement effective violence prevention and response activities in schools and communities, engaging men and boys, community leaders and parents, educating children from a young age regarding their human rights and the importance of treating all people with dignity and respect and designing educational programmes and teaching materials that support respectful relationships, non-violent behaviours, gender equality and empowerment of women and girls; 16. Encourages States to adopt, as appropriate, and implement inclusive policies and programmes to promote technical and vocational training and skills development and lifelong learning opportunities, including in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and in information and communications technology, as well as higher educational opportunities for women and girls, including those at risk of or affected by child, early and forced marriage, so as to enable them to gain the knowledge, attitudes and skills that they need to fulfil their full potential; 17. Urges Governments to promote, respect and protect the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health through the development and enforcement of policies and legal frameworks and the strengthening of health systems, including health information systems, that make universally accessible and available quality, gender-responsive, adolescent-friendly health services, sexual and reproductive health-care services, information and 7/10 commodities, HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, treatment and care, mental health services and nutrition interventions and prevention, treatment of and care for obstetric fistula and other obstetric complications by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care; 18. Also urges Governments to promote and protect the human rights of all women and girls, including the right of women, and those girls who have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and to adopt and accelerate the implementation of laws, policies and programmes that protect and enable the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including reproductive rights, in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences; 19.

Also calls upon States to take a comprehensive, rights-based, age- and gender-responsive, victim-centred, trauma-informed and multisectoral approach that takes into account linkages with other harmful practices in the prevention and response to child, early and forced marriage in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to pay particular attention to the specific needs of women and girls, in particular those in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian settings, in terms of, inter alia, access to essential services such as safe spaces, shelters and other social protection services, health-care services, safe and affordable drinking water and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, as well as access to education and to timely registration of births and marriages, while ensuring that the front-line health and social workers assisting them have access to adequate means of protection from the virus; 8/10 23. Further calls upon States to ensure that COVID-19 response measures are transformative, participatory and adequately funded, promote inclusive, gender-equal and sustainable economies and societies, and address inequalities, including gender inequality, and exclusion and poverty, which are among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage by, inter alia: (a) Putting children, including adolescents and especially adolescent girls, at the centre of sector, national and international response and recovery, while paying particular attention to their specific needs and ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in decisions that affect them, by prioritizing the continuity of child- and adolescent-centred services, with a focus on equity of access, particularly in relation to schooling, nutrition programmes, immunization, maternal and newborn care, and child protection programmes; (b) Mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its knock-on effects on families and communities by expanding programmes that protect them against economic shocks, including poverty eradication measures, labour policies, public services and gender-responsive social protection programmes; (c) Mitigating the impact of school closures, particularly for the poorest, most marginalized and vulnerable learners, especially girls, by facilitating the continuity of quality education for all, including through remote learning, re-enrolling all previously enrolled children and those who were already out of school, providing community sensitization on the importance of girls’ education, and ensure that those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, pregnant girls and women, as well as young parents, continue to have access to schooling on an equal basis with others, including by closing the digital divide and ensuring access to the Internet; (d) Adopting measures to recognize, reduce and redistribute women’s and girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the feminization of poverty, which is exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to address the discrimination and gender inequality that are at the roots of these imbalances; (ec) Ensuring continuity and strengthening protection and support services for women and girls who experience violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, during the COVID-19 pandemic, including girls at risk of child, early and forced marriage and already married girls and women affected by this practice, and designating protection shelters, hotlines and help desks, health and support services and legal protection and support as essential services for all women and girls, in addition to establishing safeguarding measures and raising awareness and providing training for police, judiciary, first responders, health workers, and education and child services staff; (f) Ensuring uninterrupted access to and funding for essential health services and to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, including in disadvantaged areas such as rural communities, informal settlements and humanitarian settings; (g) Mitigating the impact of COVID-19 response measures on the ability of civil society organizations and other relevant actors working at the local and national levels to continue their work with girls, families and local communities to prevent and respond to child, early and forced marriage; 24.

I, resolution 1, annex. '! Resolution 74/2. 2/7 further concern that, when taking care of infected family members, they are more likely to be exposed to COVID-19, Acknowledging that women and girls have specific health needs, that during the COVID-19 pandemic they must have equal access to COVID-19 prevention, mitigation and treatment interventions, as well as access to essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines and vaccines for all and effective primary health care, especially in indigenous and rural communities, and that negative social norms and gender stereotypes can have particular impacts during a widespread health crisis, Expressing concern that the spread of COVID-19 and its socioeconomic impact can negatively affect mental health, aggravated by factors such as job loss or wage cuts, inadequate or lack of nutritious food, and lack of access to safe water and sanitation and commodities, as well as additional responsibilities due to the closure of schools and care facilities, Deeply concerned that the negative socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious threat to the progress that has been made in women’s economic empowerment, economic autonomy and productive lives, and may affect them disproportionately and differently from men, as they often earn less, save less, have less access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, have less access to credit and hold less secure jobs, they are also more likely to be employed in the informal sector, which leads to less access to social protection and pensions, and are at greater risk of falling into poverty, in particular when entitlements are tied closely to formal employment, they represent the majority of single-parent households, bear the majority of domestic and unpaid care work and spend longer hours than men on unpaid care work, and as they take on greater care demands at home, their jobs and income can also be disproportionately affected by cuts and layoffs, especially since households headed by women are far more likely to be economically disadvantaged, in particular in terms of exacerbating their risk of exposure to COVID-19, Recognizing that school closures, physical distancing and containment strategies may affect girls and boys differently, especially adolescent girls, who, owing to negative social norms, are more likely to be expected to take on unpaid care and domestic work, limiting their access to remote learning and other education support programmes, and may put them at a greater risk of being subjected to harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, as well as sexual and gender-based violence, child labour and trafficking in persons, which may lead to girls, and in particular girls living in poverty, girls with disabilities, indigenous girls, migrants, refugees and those living in rural and remote areas, leaving school before the completion of their education, Noting with concern that, owing to school closures, the COVID-19 crisis has exposed the digital divide, both between and within countries, including the gender digital divide and vast disparities in the availability of learning materials, including access to the Internet, and communication devices, and that even though much focus has turned to remote learning platforms, many public schools, especially in developing countries, are not set up to use them or do not have the technology and equipment to provide online teaching, which leads to limited or lack of education for many children, especially girls, Deeply concerned by the increase in cases of gender-based violence, including domestic violence, as a result of lockdown measures, the lack of availability of protection services and the increased challenges to holding perpetrators accountable, which also affect front-line health workers and community health volunteers, 3/7 Stressing the importance of the systematic collection and use of quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by sex, age, disability and other characteristics relevant in national contexts as an essential tool for the design, implementation and evaluation of effective policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recovery, Condemning social stigma and discriminatory behaviours against those infected with COVID-19, which can negatively affect their caregivers, family members, friends and communities, and recognizing that addressing those challenges is also a critical element in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, Concerned at the proliferation of disinformation and misinformation about the pandemic, especially in the digital space, and stressing the importance of providing data and information to the public to counter such practices, Recognizing the fundamental role of the United Nations system in catalysing and coordinating the comprehensive global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the central efforts of Member States therein, recalling the constitutional mandate of the World Health Organization to act, inter alia, as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work, and recognizing its key leadership role within the broader United Nations response and the importance of strengthened multilateral cooperation in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and its extensive negative impacts, 1. Pledges to take further concrete action to ensure the full, effective and accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development during the response to the pandemic, with a view to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and the full and equal enjoyment of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms; 2. Emphasizes the need for full respect for and the protection and fulfilment of human rights, and stresses that there is no place for any form of stigmatization, discrimination, racism and xenophobia in response to the pandemic; 3. Acknowledges the measures, policies and strategies put in place by Member States to address and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 at the national level, stresses that these measures should be in accordance with the obligations of Member States under international human rights law, and urges Member States to mainstream a gender perspective on a system-wide basis when designing, implementing and monitoring such measures, policies and strategies, in meaningful consultation with and with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and, where appropriate, girls and taking into account their specific needs; 4. Takes note of various appeals made by the Secretary-General to address COVID-19 and its impacts, in particular his appeal for peace at home and in homes around the world, as well as the efforts of the United Nations system in developing policy guidelines that are responsive to the specific needs of women and girls during the pandemic; 5. Encourages Member States to take the necessary measures to implement people-centred, gender-sensitive, context-specific, whole-of-government and whole- of-society, and prevention-oriented responses when designing their health preparedness and response plans for COVID-19, outlining both immediate and long- term actions, taking into account the direct and indirect impacts on women and girls’ health and their specific needs, including by: (a) Ensuring the accessibility and availability of quality health care, including ongoing access to essential, safe, affordable, effective and quality medicines for all, without discrimination of any kind, with particular attention to patients with chronic diseases, older women, victims of violence, antenatal and postnatal care and delivery 4/7 services, including emergency obstetric and newborn care, putting in place necessary infection control measures and maintaining HIV/AIDS voluntary and confidential testing, counselling and treatment access with no interruptions, particularly, but not exclusively, in terms of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, and recognizing, in this regard, the role of extensive immunization against COVID-19 as a global public good for health in preventing, containing and stopping transmission in order to bring the pandemic to an end, once safe, quality, efficacious, effective, accessible and affordable vaccines are available; (b) Ensuring a sufficient supply of hygiene kits and necessary medical supplies, voluntary and informed family planning methods for women and sanitary pads for all women and girls, as well as the provision of care through innovative strategies such as mobile clinics; (c) Ensuring that verified and scientific COVID-19 public health messages, including targeted prevention and precautionary measures to be taken at the individual and community levels, are developed and disseminated, as appropriate, in accessible formats and through multiple media platforms to ensure that these messages are widely available to all women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, pregnant women, older women, women living with HIV/AIDS, internally displaced, refugee and migrant women and girls, as well as indigenous women and women living in remote and rural communities; (d) Taking appropriate measures to address the specific physical, mental and psychological health needs of and psychosocial support for female front-line health workers and to create a safe, enabling and violence-free working environment for them; providing appropriate personal protective equipment, including essential hygiene and sanitation items, and access to safe and affordable water, particularly for those female health workers quarantined; addressing the gender pay gap, where it exists, in the health sector; and ensuring their full, effective and meaningful participation in decision-making and response planning; (ec) Developing, as appropriate, psychological services as well as other community-based solutions, including making use of digital spaces, for the provision of mental health and psychosocial support for women and girls; (f) Engaging all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, women’s organizations, youth-led organizations, the private sector and academia, through, inter alia, participatory and transparent multi-stakeholder platforms and partnerships, to provide input to the development, implementation and evaluation of policies responsive to COVID-19, in order to take into account the specific needs of women and girls; 6. | Urges Member States to allocate resources to the continuation of universal access to health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, such as family planning and maternal health care for women to prevent high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, as well as the exposure of pregnant women to the virus in health facilities, including while accessing antenatal care and delivery; 7. Encourages Member States to introduce, adjust or expand, as necessary, national social protection programmes and adapt targeting methodologies, as appropriate, to ensure access to social protection and assistance programmes that would support those affected by COVID-19, especially women, by expanding the reach and benefit levels of social assistance programmes, including to those working in the informal sector, such as cash transfers and social pensions, as well as other programmes that can be implemented with low transaction cost, and to ensure that the information on the availability of and ways to access these social protection and assistance programmes is widely available and accessible to all women and girls, especially those who are vulnerable or in vulnerable situations; 5/7 8. Calls upon Member States to uphold children’s right to education, and in that regard urges them to ensure girls’ access to quality education by implementing appropriate measures, including, when relevant, by supporting families to allow their children, in particular girls, to return to school in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic and promote continuous education throughout the pandemic; 9. Encourages Member States to ensure access to infrastructure and public services, including access to safe and affordable water and sanitation, as well as menstrual hygiene management for all women and girls, and safe and affordable transportation, inter alia during humanitarian emergencies, including in rural areas and informal settlements, settlements for internally displaced persons, refugee camps, as well as migrant shelters; 10. Recognizes that older women, women and girls with disabilities and those with underlying medical conditions require special attention because of their higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19, and in this regard encourages Member States to develop the necessary measures to support them as well as help household caregivers, including by ensuring access to and continuity of essential care for older persons and persons with disabilities, while ensuring that older persons and persons with disabilities are treated with respect and on an equal basis, and to implement more flexible measures for those employees who are caregivers in their household by considering expanding access to paid leave and paid sick leave; 11. Urges Member States to take effective measures to prevent and respond to the increase of violence against women and girls amid the COVID-19 pandemic by integrating evidence-based prevention, response and protection measures, including by designating and expanding the capacity of domestic violence shelters as essential services and supporting them, as well as increasing resources, in collaboration with civil society on the front line of response, ensuring access to justice for women and girls who are victims of violence and stepping up advocacy and awareness -raising campaigns to address all forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls, particularly during confinement; 12. Recognizes the importance of strengthening the leadership and full, equal and meaningful participation of women in all decision-making processes in the design and implementation of national response and recovery policies and strategies to address the COVID-19 outbreak, which poses multidimensional threats, and for which the promotion of people’s engagement and inclusiveness, particularly of women, families and communities, is fundamental for a more effective, immediate and rapid response; 13. Calls upon Member States to ensure that all relevant policies and procedures are responsive to the specific needs of women and girls in the light of the efforts made to reduce the impact of COVID-19, document the efforts of government on women across policies to protect them and their family members from COVID-19, and implement all those policies with necessary supporting programmes and initiatives; 14. Encourages States to collect quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by age, sex, disability and other characteristics relevant in national contexts relating to the impact of COVID-19 and response and recovery efforts to ensure that targeted policies and programmes to address challenges faced by women and girls are adequately identified and addressed; 15. Urges intensified international cooperation, including North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, bearing in mind that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a complement to, North-South cooperation, as well as public-private partnerships to contain, mitigate and defeat the pandemic, including by exchanging information, scientific knowledge and best 6/7 practices, and to ensure that these efforts are gender-responsive in order to ensure that women and girls are not disproportionately affected or left behind in response efforts; 16. Calls upon relevant entities of the United Nations system to assist Member States, upon their request, in designing and implementing gender-sensitive national plans and strategies, in order to respond to and recover from the pandemic; 17. Requests the Secretary-General to take the steps necessary to effectively coordinate and follow up on the implementation of the present resolution and, in this regard, to consider briefing the General Assembly on its implementation, as appropriate. 7/7",11/03/2020,2020_3890604,Guinea,N/A,yes

'2 Resolution 68/3. 2/10 the persistent gaps in this regard, and identifies good practices and recommended actions in accessibility for the effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the disability-inclusive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Welcoming progress towards mainstreaming disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in the work of the United Nations, and noting with appreciation the launch of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and the leadership of the Secretary-General to bring about transformative and systematic change on disability inclusion across the United Nations system, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters, Recognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, and that persons with disabilities and their families should receive social protection and assistance to enable the family and its members to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with disabilities, Recognizing further the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality, non-discrimination and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Concerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to obtain health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, a lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, 3/10 Recognizing that persons with disabilities are directly and _ indirectly disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated existing inequalities, discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion and increased the risk of unemployment and poverty, as well as of violence and abuse, in particular against women and girls with disabilities, recognizing also that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as face barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may have higher rates of underlying risk factors, and have a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 disease, developing severe health conditions or being fatally affected by it, Reaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Taking note of the initiatives that the Secretary-General, United Nations agencies and United Nations entities have undertaken in order to promote disability inclusion in COVID-19 response and recovery efforts as a vital step towards achieving the pledge to leave no one behind, and noting in this regard the importance of promoting equal access of persons with disabilities to social services, quality education and health care, full and productive employment and decent work, encouraging their effective and meaningful participation, protecting their human rights, eliminating discrimination against them, and systematically collecting and using data disaggregated by sex, age and disability, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, Recognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities into development policies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, meaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development 4/10 programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,!* and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high- 3 Such as the Guidelines and Principles for the Development of Disability Statistics (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.01.XVII.15) and the Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.07.XVIL.8). 5/10 quality, accessible, timely and reliable data to measure progress in the implementation of the Goals for persons with disabilities, 1.

Resolution 70/1. 2/11 pandemic are projected to result in 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that otherwise would have been averted by 2030, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering of information on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Noting with concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls, but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Noting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of education are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic independence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women can expand their options for leaving abusive relationships, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls, Recognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and 3/11 confronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the importance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that respond to their specific needs, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict, public health emergencies and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Expressing deep concern about the unprecedented and multifaceted negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of, and efforts to end, child, 4/11 early and forced marriage, including the wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences and devastating impacts of the pandemic on the livelihoods of people and families, especially women and girls, and the poorest and most vulnerable, as well as the severe disruption to health and education systems, social protection programmes and the provision of protection and support services, including essential Services, Noting with deep concern that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, are likely to increase risks faced by girls, including already married girls, as well as women affected by this harmful practice, including risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, unintended and/or early pregnancy, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the associated risk of not returning to school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services, hindering the fulfilment of their rights and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations, Expressing deep concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates root causes of child, early and forced marriage, but also diverts international, regional and national attention and resources away from, inter alia, the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices, and furthermore that COVID-19 containment measures are delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, 1. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;” 2. Calls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, teachers, religious, traditional and community leaders, civil society, organizations led by girls, women’s organizations, youth and human rights groups, the media and the private sector, to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive and coordinated responses and strategies to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, to support girls and women who are affected or at risk, who have fled such a marriage or whose marriage has dissolved, and widowed girls or women who were married as girls, including through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection mechanisms such as safe shelters, access to justice and the sharing of best practices across borders; 3.

Further calls upon States to promote awareness-raising about the harmful effects of child, early and forced marriage on the individual and wider society and the benefits of ending this harmful practice, including through open dialogue with all stakeholders, including girls and boys, women and men, religious, traditional and community leaders, parents, legal guardians and other family members, to work with local communities to combat negative social norms and gender stereotypes that condone child, early and forced marriage, to empower parents and communities to abandon the practice and to empower all women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives; 10. Recognizes that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding and that parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child, acknowledging the need to support their capacity to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, and reaffirming that the best interests of the child will be their basic concern; 11. Urges Governments, while addressing child, early and forced marriage, to confront family poverty and social exclusion through investing in family-oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 12. Also urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, to tackle poverty, lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage, including by ensuring the rights of women and girls to inheritance and property, their equal access with men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, to encourage girls to continue their education, including through their re-enrolment in school after childbirth, to develop livelihood opportunities through access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills education, including financial literacy, and to promote freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as equal political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; 6/11 13. Encourages States to promote and protect the human rights of already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution and to address their specific needs, such as through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, increase their decision-making power, make it easier for them to seek formal employment, increase their economic independence and financial literacy, access education, skills development programmes and lifelong learning opportunities, ensure their equal access to health-care services and information and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 14. Calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school, including because of marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, which empowers young women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education that is relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 15.

A. 2/10 efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres in all regions of the world, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, and impairs their full enjoyment of, all human rights, Recognizing that women’s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and from the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women and girls impedes the social and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between men and women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major impediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, as well as economic and political life, Recognizing further the special needs of women and girls living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism, and that global health threats, climate change, more frequent and intense natural disasters, conflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related humanitarian crises and the forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent decades and have particular negative impacts on women and girls that need to be comprehensively assessed and addressed, Recognizing that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its impunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for action by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such violence may include stalking, death threats and threats of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as related trends against women and girls in digital contexts, such as trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, including unwanted verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women and girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, Alarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, including gender- related killings of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the world, which constitutes an extreme form of violence against women and girls, is among the least punished crimes, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including in ending impunity for such crimes, Gravely concerned that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, remains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all social strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse or impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, as such, is unacceptable, Stressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in preventing and eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and sexual harassment, Recognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such violence the family can play an important role, 3/10 Deeply concerned by the increased violence against women and girls around the world, including domestic violence, as well as harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child early and forced marriage, including in conflict-affected areas, particularly in the context of confinement measures and school closures adopted in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Taking note of the response plans, policies and initiatives implemented by Governments and civil society in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, and facilitate reporting thereon, and to ensure that all women and girls can lead lives free from violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination, including through the use of digital technologies, media, helplines or the mobilization of grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and other service providers to help victims to find safe spaces and seek support, Underscoring that, often, a lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, persisting impunity, all forms of discrimination, including structural discrimination, insufficient recourse for victims of violence against women and girls, gender stereotypes and negative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as well as negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced income, prevent many women and girls, as applicable, from reporting or acting as witnesses and from seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Acknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, and in this regard stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, '° as well as of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, ""” Emphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data on violence against women and girls, including disaggregated data, and on its prevalence, patterns and drivers, as well as on effective approaches to prevent and respond to it impedes efforts to design and implement measures, including, where appropriate, policies and legislation, to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, Encouraging the removal of all barriers to women’s access to justice and ensuring that they all have access to information about their rights as well as effective legal assistance so that they can make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal proceedings and issues relating to family law, and also ensuring that they have access to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, including formal and appropriate informal justice mechanisms, as provided for by national legislation and, where necessary, the adoption of national legislation, 16 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2237, No. 39574. 'T Resolution 64/293. 4/10 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors such as a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing sexual and gender-based violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, Recognizing the need to promote the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and women’s organizations, including victims and survivors of violence, in the development, implementation and evaluation of gender-responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of women and girls and their access to education and essential health services, the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, are deepening already existing inequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls made in recent decades, 1.

(k) Taking and implementing further measures to ensure that all officials, including those in leadership positions, responsible for implementing policies and programmes aimed at preventing violence against women and girls, protecting and assisting victims and investigating and punishing acts of violence receive training on gender equality and women’s and girls’ empowerment to raise their awareness of gender-specific needs, as well as of the underlying causes and the short- and long- term impact of violence against women and girls, and training on gender-responsive investigation of crimes of violence against women and girls; (1) Removing barriers, including political, legal, cultural, social, economic, institutional and religious ones, preventing women’s full, equal and effective participation in leadership and political and other decision-making positions, taking into account that promoting women to leadership positions may significantly reduce the risk of violence against them;

Requests the Secretary-General to establish and administer a trust fund for the Judicial Fellowship Programme of the International Court of Justice, in accordance with the terms of reference as set out in the annex to the present resolution, through which States, international financial institutions, donor agencies, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and natural and juridical persons can make voluntary financial contributions in support of the Programme; 2.

Requests the Secretary-General to continue to publicize the Programme and periodically to invite States, international financial institutions, donor agencies, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and natural and juridical persons to make voluntary financial contributions to the new trust fund or otherwise assist in the implementation and possible expansion of the Programme; 5. Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session on the implementation of the present resolution. 2/7 Annex Terms of reference of the trust fund for the Judicial Fellowship Programme of the International Court of Justice I. Establishment 1. The trust fund for the Judicial Fellowship Programme of the International Court of Justice is established by the Secretary-General at the request of the General Assembly. II. Background 2. The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It functions in accordance with its Statute which is annexed to the Charter of the United Nations. The seat of the Court is at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands. 3. The Court’s role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by United Nations organs in accordance with the Charter and by specialized agencies authorized to do so. The Court is composed of 15 judges, who are elected for terms of office of nine years by the General Assembly and the Security Council. It is assisted by the Registry, its administrative organ. Its official languages are English and French. 4. The Court has always had a special interest in engaging young people in its judicial activities. The Court has continuously emphasized in its annual reports to the General Assembly, especially since 2012, the importance of enabling students from a wide range of geographic and linguistic backgrounds to familiarize themselves with the work of the Court and develop their skills in the field of the peaceful settlement of international disputes through the law. This long-standing interest of the Court is in line with several Assembly resolutions in which States, international organizations and institutions are encouraged to increase their activities to promote the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, in particular those activities which are of special benefit to persons from developing countries. ! 5. Unfortunately, there is no line in the budget of the Court which allows it to fund temporary stays of recent law graduates at the Court to gain working experience. The Court was therefore greatly pleased when in 1999 the New York University School of Law offered to provide fellowship awards to five of its students per year to serve as university trainees at the Court and to enable these law graduates to gain experience working under the supervision of a member of the Court. The Court accepted this offer and established a University Traineeship Programme for this purpose. Under the terms of the agreement between the Court and New York University, the University was responsible for providing a monthly fellowship award to the selected candidates for the 10-month duration of their training at the Court. 6. In the following years, the Court sought to expand the University Traineeship Programme to other universities. Therefore, the Court invited other universities to nominate candidates to the Programme. Thanks to these efforts, between 2002 and 2015, a number of universities joined and started to nominate candidates for the ' See, for example, the twelfth preambular paragraph of resolution 74/185 on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law. 3/7 Programme. To enlarge even further the number of participating universities, participation in the Programme was opened in 2015 to all universities with law faculties, which have been invited every year since 2016 to nominate candidates through a call for applications posted on the website of the Court. 7. In 2017, the Court changed the name of the University Traineeship Programme to that of “Judicial Fellowship Programme” to reflect more accurately the nature of the activities in which the fellows are required to participate at the Court. Nonetheless, the Judicial Fellowship Programme retained the key features of the University Traineeship Programme. 8. The Judicial Fellowship Programme is an apprenticeship programme which enables recent law graduates to develop their skills in the field of the peaceful settlement of international disputes through the law. It aims to improve participants’ understanding of international law and the Court’s procedures by actively involving them in the work of the Court. Each fellow is assigned to one judge for a period of around 10 months, from early September to June or July of the following year. During this period, participants attend public hearings of the Court, research and write memorandums on legal questions or factual aspects of pending cases and are involved in other aspects of the Court’s work. Each participant works alongside an associate legal officer, who is the primary legal assistant of a judge and is employed by the United Nations. 9. The Court accepts up to 15 fellows a year, with no more than one from each nominating university. The Court looks for candidates who have achieved excellent results in their law studies and who have demonstrated an interest in international law through their studies or publications. Candidates are usually in the early stages of their legal careers. In making its selection, the Court seeks to choose candidates of various nationalities. 10. To date, all candidates have been nominated and sponsored by their respective universities, which undertake to fund the stipend, health insurance and travel costs of the candidate, if selected. 11. Over the years, it has become clear to the Court that the fact that participating universities are expected to provide a stipend to the students they nominate has tended to exclude less-endowed universities, particularly those based in developing countries, from nominating candidates, thus limiting the possibility for the Court to select fellows from a number of geographical regions. As a result, otherwise eligible students, who do not attend well-endowed universities based in developed countries, do not have the opportunity to participate in the Programme. 12. From 2000 to 2019, a total of 193 fellows participated in the Programme; 95 per cent were sponsored by universities based in countries of the Group of Western European and other States. During the same period, no fellows were sponsored by universities in Africa and Eastern Europe. Only one fellow (0.5 per cent) was sponsored by a university in Latin America and the Caribbean, and eight fellows (4 per cent) were sponsored by universities in the Asia Pacific region. Of the 193 fellows, the overwhelming majority (68 per cent) were nationals of countries of the Group of Western European and other States. Only 11 fellows (5 per cent) were nationals of Eastern European countries, 13 (6 per cent) of African countries, 17 (8 per cent) of Latin American and Caribbean countries and 30 (13 per cent) of Asia- Pacific countries. 13. As the above statistics demonstrate, there is a need to establish a mechanism which would offer universities based in developing countries an opportunity to participate in the Programme on a sustainable basis and to nominate students who may be selected as judicial fellows by the Court. This would correct the current 4/7 imbalance in the Programme which might otherwise be perceived as catering only to law graduates from a limited number of countries and the universities based therein. However, similar to any other activity involving the Court, such a mechanism should be compliant with the requirements of the Statute and Rules of the Court. Accordingly, the contemplated mechanism should not entail that the Court engages with individual Member States to mobilize contributions for its Judicial Fellowship Programme. In addition, the mechanism should not allow States who wish to support the Programme to offer or to make direct payments to the Court. 14. It is proposed that such a mechanism take the form of the trust fund established by the Secretary-General at the request of the General Assembly. The regulations of the trust fund will have to comply with the requirements of independence and impartiality of the Court in accordance with its Statute, while making it capable of providing an opportunity to young law graduates, from universities based in developing countries, to participate in the Programme. Ill. Purpose 15. The purpose of the trust fund is to grant fellowship awards to selected candidates who are nationals of developing countries from universities based in developing countries, thereby guaranteeing the geographic and linguistic diversity of the participants in the Programme. 16. The award will consist of a monthly stipend and will cover travel and health insurance costs. It should be sufficient to provide for a minimum standard of accommodation and subsistence in The Hague, in order to ensure that recipients can fully benefit from their participation in the Programme without the burden of financial hardship. IV. Authority 17. The trust fund will be administered in conformity with the applicable United Nations financial regulations, rules, policies and procedures. V. Contributions to the trust fund 18. Contributions to the trust fund can be made by States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, national institutions, bar associations, private institutions and individuals, and other appropriate entities. 19. Cash contributions to the trust fund may be accepted in fully convertible currencies. Such contributions will be deposited into the designated bank account. 20. The making of a pledge and its acceptance are to be recorded in an exchange of letters, and in a more formal agreement if requested by the donor. 21. Any interest income derived from contributions to the trust fund will be credited to the trust fund. VI. Administration 22. The trust fund will be administered by the Secretary-General. The Court may be associated with the performance of certain administrative functions of a general nature entailed by the management of the trust fund. However, the modalities for the 5/7 administration of the trust fund should not require the Court to directly engage with individual Member States to mobilize contributions to the trust fund or to be directly involved in the administration of the financial resources collected. VII. Application for the fellowship award 23. Universities based in developing countries that cannot afford to sponsor fellows that are nationals of developing countries may apply for a fellowship award for their candidates when nominating them for the Programme in accordance with the procedures established by the Court. VIII. Selection of the recipients and granting of the fellowship award 24. The Court will draw up and publicize the eligibility criteria for the fellowship award. 25. The Court will select the recipients of the award from the list of candidates who meet the standard eligibility criteria for the Programme. 26. The Court will make its final selection taking into account the available resources in the trust fund and the number of qualified candidates in respect of whom applications for the award have been made. IX. Reporting 27. The Secretary-General will provide an annual financial statement for the trust fund showing income and expenditures as at 31 December of each year and detailing the funds pledged and received. 28. Allaccounts and financial statements will be expressed in United States dollars. 29. The Secretary-General will prepare a substantive progress report on implementation as required by the General Assembly. X. Programme support costs 30. In accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, programme support costs will be charged to the trust fund. In addition, the trust fund Operating reserve will be applied within the cash resources of the trust fund to cover any delays in payments of contributions and to meet final expenditures of the activities covered from the trust fund. The trust fund operating reserve is calculated as a percentage of the estimated annual expenditures. XI. Audit 31. The trust fund is exclusively subject to the internal and external auditing procedures provided for in the United Nations financial regulations, rules and policies. 6/7 XII. Closure of the trust fund 32. Should it be decided to close the trust fund for any reason, any balances for each donor remaining at the time the trust fund is terminated will be disposed of in consultation with the donor, and in a manner consistent with the purpose of the trust fund and with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. 20-16708 7/7",12/10/2020,2020_3894518,Guinea,N/A,yes
