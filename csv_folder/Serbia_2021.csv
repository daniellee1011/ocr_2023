the civilian population should be an important aspect in this regard, Reiterating deep concern at the increasing number of civilians in ongoing armed conflict and related violence facing the threat of conflict-induced food insecurity and the threat of famine, Noting that the humanitarian situation in many armed conflicts can also be compounded by economic crises, increasingly frequent and severe weather events, and natural disasters and has deteriorated as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in this regard, reaffirming the need for combatting and sustainably recovering from the pandemic, Recalling the obligations of all parties to armed conflicts under international law, including international human rights law, as applicable, and international humanitarian law including

Goal 4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, its specific and interlinked targets, and other education-related Goals and targets, and recalling the importance of education for reaching all Sustainable Development Goals, Reaffirming further Human Rights Council resolution 8/4 of 18 June 2008, and recalling all other resolutions of the Council on the right to education, the most recent of which is resolution 44/3 of 16 July 2020, and also the resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on the subject, Bearing in mind the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training and the World Programme for Human Rights Education, which both underline the importance of human rights education as an integral part of the right to education, GE.21-09154(E) A/HRC/47/L.4 Expressing concern that, in spite of the progress achieved in the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 4, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, there are still 773 million adults who are not literate, two thirds of whom are women, and 258 million children, adolescents and youth who do not attend school, and that, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund, 50 per cent of pre- primary-age children around the world — at least 175 million — are not enrolled in pre-primary education, Recalling the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030 — towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, adopted at the World Education Forum 2015, held in Incheon, Republic of Korea, which aims to mobilize all countries and partners and provide guidance on achieving the effective implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 4 and meeting the related targets on education for all, including for women and girls, persons belonging to minorities, stateless and internally displaced persons, migrants, asylum seekers and refugees, Reiterating the

parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights by all appropriate means, in particular the adoption of legislative measures, Expressing deep concern about the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the right to education for all, taking into account that more than 1.5 billion learners have been affected by the closure of educational institutions worldwide, Expressing concern also that, despite the tremendous efforts made by States and other stakeholders, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected those in the most vulnerable and marginalized situations, including in particular girls and women, persons with disabilities, persons living in poverty, migrants, asylum seekers, refugees, stateless and internally displaced persons and students in developing countries, and has exposed and exacerbated the entrenched structural inequalities in the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education, Reiterating the importance of early childhood development as a valuable foundation of lifelong learning and the entire education system, and the need to invest in early childhood education and care, Strongly condemning the recurring attacks on students, teachers, schools and universities, and the military use of educational facilities, which impair the realization of the right to education and cause severe and long-lasting harm to individuals and societies, Recognizing the negative impact of climate change, natural disasters, conflict and crisis on the full realization of the right to education, the fact that a large proportion of the world’s out-of-school population lives in conflict-affected areas, and that crises, violence and attacks on and the military use of educational institutions, natural disasters and pandemics continue to disrupt education and development globally, Recognizing also that girls are disproportionately represented among out-of-school children and that women are disproportionately represented among illiterate adults owing to, inter alia, gender-based discrimination and violence, including sexual violence and harassment; lack of a safe learning environment; child, early or forced marriage or unplanned pregnancy; the lack of appropriate water and sanitation facilities and menstrual health and hygiene supplies; discriminatory laws; gender stereotypes; patriarchal social norms; lack of empowerment, including on economic grounds, especially when education is not free; and discrimination based on any other grounds, such as race, colour, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, migration or other status, A/HRC/47/L.4 Recognizing further the role that access to information and communications technology, including the Internet, plays in facilitating the realization of the right to education and in promoting inclusive quality education, in particular in situations of emergencies, and recalling its important role during the COVID-19 pandemic, when on-site education has had to be suspended, Expressing concern at the inequalities in access to information and communications technology, which have increased the digital divides and expanded technological gaps, including but not limited to those based on gender, age, disability and migration or refugee status, and with their negative impact on the realization of the right to education, Stressing in this respect that the incorporation of digital technologies in education, notwithstanding its potential to expand and complement access to education, is not a long- term replacement for on-site schooling, and the need for a thorough debate on the role of digital technologies in education, keeping in mind not only equality of opportunities, including for conflict-affected areas, but also its potential unintended negative effects, including on children’s and young persons’ health, education and interpersonal development, the changes it may create in the organization of education systems and the potential to serve as an equalizer for marginalized children and young persons, Reaffirming that the human rights principles of non-discrimination and equality are central to the full realization of the right to education as enshrined in the Convention against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and emphasizing that everyone is entitled to the right to education without discrimination of any kind, Noting that education systems should nurture cultural diversity with a view to protecting cultural rights and fostering mutual understanding, respect for diversity and tolerance, Welcoming the steps taken to fully realize the right to education, such as the enactment of appropriate legislation, adjudication by national courts, the development of national indicators, and ensuring justiciability of this right, and aware of the role that communications procedures at the regional and international levels can play in promoting the justiciability of the right to education, Noting the development by experts of guiding principles and tools for States, such as the Abidjan principles on the human rights obligations of States to provide public education and to regulate private involvement in education, Noting also the efforts aimed at promoting and protecting the right to education and facilitating continuation of education in armed conflict, including the efforts of States that are signatories to the Safe Schools Declaration, 1.

Further calls upon States to continue to strengthen the protection of preschools, schools and universities against attacks, making them free from all forms of violence, including by taking measures to deter the military use of schools, such as by considering implementing the Guidelines for Protecting schools and universities from military use during armed conflict, and encourages efforts to provide safe, non-violent inclusive, effective and enabling learning environments and quality education for all within an appropriate time frame, including all levels of education in the context of humanitarian emergencies and conflict situations; 9. Calls upon States to accelerate efforts to eliminate gender-based discrimination, harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage, and all forms of violence abuse and harassment, including moral and sexual harassment, school-related sexual and gender-based violence, and bullying in schools and other educational settings both online and offline, in particular against those groups of persons who are most vulnerable, discriminated against and marginalized, and to guarantee gender equality and the right to education for all; 10.

Goal 5, in particular targets 5.2 and 5.3, and the commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 16, and taking into account the commitment to leave no one behind, Acknowledging the important role played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities, including women and girls with disabilities of African and Asian descent, are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Condemning the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and recognizing the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in

medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of

necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent health-care services, maternal health-care services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services can violate, abuse or impair the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Recognizing that information and communications technologies, including assistive technology and devices, have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can create conditions enabling the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and can contribute to their social and digital inclusion and digital literacy, empowerment and autonomy, and allow them to live independently on an equal basis with others and to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in society and in the world of work, while condemning all forms of violence against women and girls with disabilities in digital contexts, including new forms of violence such as cyberviolence, bullying and harassment, and their

and led by persons with disabilities, older women, girls and youth, feminist groups, women and girl human rights defenders and disability inclusion advocates, and recognizing further the importance of having open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence

condemned and eliminated and that women’s and girls’ access to justice and accountability for violations of their human rights must be ensured, GE.21-09200(E) A/HRC/47/L.18 Recalling also the commitment to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 5, in particular targets 5.2 and 5.3, and the commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build

important role played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls in all their diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Recognizing further the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and A/HRC/47/L.18 ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as facing barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, Stressing that States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access A/HRC/47/L.18 to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent-friendly health services, maternal health care and services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and services can violate, abuse or impair the right to attain the highest standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against

open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment and domestic violence, by, inter alia, providing for a supportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, including by raising awareness about the human rights of women and girls in all their A/HRC/47/L.18 diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing further that domestic violence is not a private family matter and must be eliminated, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the right to education for all, taking into account that more than 1.5 billion learners have been affected by the closure of educational institutions

communications technology, which have increased the digital divides and expanded technological gaps, including but not limited to those based on gender, age, disability and migration or refugee status, and with their negative impact on the realization of the right to education, Stressing in this respect that the incorporation of digital technologies in education, notwithstanding its potential to expand and complement access to education, is not a long- term replacement for on-site schooling, and the need for a thorough debate on the role of digital technologies in education, keeping in mind not only equality of opportunities, including for conflict-affected areas, but also its potential unintended negative effects, including on children’s and young persons’ health, education and interpersonal development, the changes it may create in the organization of education systems and the potential to serve as an equalizer for marginalized children and young persons,

States, and reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant international instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Recalling previous Human Rights Council resolutions on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights, Reaffirming the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and their review conferences and outcome documents, and reaffirming also the resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women and the resolutions of the Commission on Population and Development, Recalling the commitment contained in Sustainable Development Goal 3 to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, Welcoming the efforts of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, within their Please recycle eS GE.21-09295(E) A/HRC/47/L.23 respective mandates, to prevent maternal mortality and to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, Recognizing that maternal morbidity, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has a negative impact on the woman’s or girl’s well-being, Recognizing also that preventable maternal morbidity is a human rights concern and that preventable deaths and grievous injuries sustained by women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth are not inevitable events, but rather a direct result of discriminatory laws and practices, harmful gender norms and practices, a lack of functioning health systems and services and a lack of accountability, Stressing the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of, inadequate or inaccessible health-care services, early childbearing, child, early and forced marriage, violence against women and girls, sociocultural barriers, marginalization, illiteracy and gender inequality as root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, equality, accountability, engagement, participation, accessibility, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, non-discrimination and international cooperation, Recognizing also that the underlying determinants of health, such as equitable access to affordable and safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, as well as quality and essential health-care services, are essential to ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing further that violations of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Recognizing also that the right to seek, receive and impart information concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights issues is essential for the accessibility of services, and that unequal access to information by women and girls, including indigenous women and girls, those from ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and those from other marginalized groups, amounts to discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and A/HRC/47/L.23 morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls, including adolescents, throughout the world, Deeply concerned also that women and girls living in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian and conflict settings, are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of human rights violations and abuses, including through sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and lack of affordable, accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment and all types of malnutrition, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overloaded health systems, the reallocation of human and financial resources, including the redeployment of midwives, shortages of medical personnel and supplies, and disruptions to global supply chains, which could undermine the sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights of women and girls, and has affected the availability of and access to health-care workers, access to maternal and newborn care and other essential maternal and child health support and services; safe abortion, when not against national law, and post- abortion care; sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights information and education; contraception; and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, while fear of contracting the virus may inhibit women and girls from visiting health-care facilities, thereby increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned that widespread discrimination against women and girls, including on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, racial or ethnic background, language, religion, health, indigenous or other status, and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination substantially heighten their risk of suffering maternal morbidities, and that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic discrimination faced by women and girls and increased the occurrence of sexual and gender- based violence and harassment, child, early and forced marriage and unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents, thereby also increasing the risk of maternal morbidity, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that the stigma, shame and isolation associated with specific forms of maternal morbidities can lead to harassment, discrimination, ostracism and violence against women and girls and can prevent them from seeking care, thereby resulting in physical, psychological, economic and social harm to or suffering for women and girls, Recognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates not only between but also within countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas and among women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and severe morbidity among adolescent girls in developing countries, and recognizing the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, A/HRC/47/L.23 Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, to the full enjoyment of their human rights, to their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, Deeply concerned that maternal morbidity reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates the full enjoyment of their rights, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, best practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy, and to guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence- based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion, when not against national law, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2.

Also calls upon States to address the underlying determinants of health, such as gender discrimination and socioeconomic factors, including poverty and malnutrition, which render certain women and girls, including adolescents, more vulnerable to maternal morbidities, such as obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others; 5. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a human rights-based approach, to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of available, accessible, acceptable and quality health- care services for all, and of information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, poverty, stigma and lack of confidentiality of medical patient records, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, shortages in human and material resources facing health-care systems, shortages in humanitarian assistance and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and discrimination, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Calls upon States to promote human rights-based and gender responsive multisectoral and cross-disciplinary coordination of policies, programmes, budgets and services designed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities with the active participation of all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, and especially the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls at the national, local and community levels, and to promote social accountability mechanisms to monitor these policies, programmes, budgets and A/HRC/47/L.23 services in order to accelerate the elimination of maternal mortality and morbidity and the achievement of universal access to sexual and reproductive health; 7.

Also urges States to strengthen their research, data collection and monitoring and evaluation systems to promote reliable, transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls, in order to support more comprehensive policies to prevent and address maternal morbidities; 9. Calls upon States to increase awareness and the visibility of maternal morbidity as a human rights concern, including through more targeted research in this area, allocation of sufficient resources and dedicated efforts to ensure the availability, particularly for women and girls, of information on the causes of specific maternal morbidities and their prevention; 10. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,! which focuses on maternal morbidity as a human rights issue, and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 11. | Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, such as by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 12. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect bodily autonomy and privacy rights and the equal right to decide autonomously in matters regarding one’s own life and health by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights law and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviour that are discriminatory; 13. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws and standards aimed at preventing violations of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, such as by informing women and girls of their rights under relevant normative frameworks and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 14. Calls upon States to ensure gender equality, women’s rights and children’s rights through inclusive public awareness-raising and evidence-based initiatives, including in schools, through the media and online, and by incorporating curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender- ' A/ARC/45/19.

reinforcing, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant international instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International

Commission on Population and Development, Recalling the commitment contained in Sustainable Development Goal 3 to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, Ohno Please recycle OS) oF a GE.21-09443(E) A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 Welcoming the efforts of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, within their respective mandates, to prevent maternal mortality and to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and their review conferences and outcome documents, in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, Recognizing that maternal morbidity, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has a negative impact on the woman’s or girl’s well-being, Recognizing also that preventable maternal morbidity is a human rights concern and that preventable deaths and grievous injuries sustained by women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth are not inevitable events, but rather a direct result of discriminatory laws and practices, harmful gender norms and practices, a lack of functioning health systems and services and a lack of accountability, Stressing the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of, inadequate or inaccessible health-care services, early childbearing, child, early and forced marriage, violence against women and girls, sociocultural barriers, marginalization, illiteracy and gender inequality as root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, equality, accountability, engagement, participation, accessibility, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, non-discrimination and international cooperation, Recognizing also that the underlying determinants of health, such as equitable access to affordable and safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, as well as quality and essential health-care services, are essential to ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing further that violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and those involving inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post- partum depression and infertility, among others, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Recognizing also that the right to seek, receive and impart information concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights issues is essential for the accessibility of services, and that unequal access to information by women and girls, including indigenous A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 women and girls, those from ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and those from other marginalized groups, amounts to discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls, including adolescents, throughout the world, Deeply concerned also that women and girls living in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian and conflict settings, are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of human rights violations and abuses, including through sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and lack of affordable, accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment and all types of malnutrition, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overloaded health systems, the reallocation of human and financial resources, including the redeployment of midwives, shortages of medical personnel and supplies, and disruptions to global supply chains, which could undermine the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls, and has affected the availability of and access to health-care workers, access to maternal and newborn care and other essential maternal and child health support and services; safe abortion when not against national law, and post- abortion care; sexual and reproductive health information and education; contraception; and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, while fear of contracting the virus may inhibit women and girls from visiting health-care facilities, thereby increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned that widespread discrimination against women and girls, including on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, racial or ethnic background, language, religion, health, indigenous or other status, and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination substantially heighten their risk of suffering maternal morbidities, and that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic discrimination faced by women and girls and increased the occurrence of sexual and gender- based violence and harassment, child, early and forced marriage and unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents, thereby also increasing the risk of maternal morbidity, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that the stigma, shame and isolation associated with specific forms of maternal morbidities can lead to harassment, discrimination, ostracism and violence against women and girls and can prevent them from seeking care, thereby resulting in physical, psychological, economic and social harm to or suffering for women and girls, Recognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates not only between but also within countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas and among women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and severe morbidity among adolescent girls in A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 developing countries, and recognizing the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, to the full enjoyment of their human rights, to their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, Deeply concerned that maternal morbidity reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates the full enjoyment of their rights, 1.

Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Recalling all relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 32/20 of 1 July 2016 and 35/22 of 22 June 2017, Recalling also that gender equality and the right to education have been recognized in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which the Assembly addressed the need to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in order to ensure that no one is left behind, and stated that the systematic mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial, Recognizing that the full realization of the right to education for all is an essential condition for achieving sustainable development, and in this regard encouraging States to GE.21-09153(E) A/HRC/47/L.3 effectively implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Sustainable Development Goal 4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, underlining the commitment therein to eliminate gender disparities in education, and Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, Recalling the need to ensure that all children enjoy the right to education and are ensured equal access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education, the need to eliminate gender disparities in education by 2030, and the need to build and upgrade education facilities that are child- focused, disability- and gender-sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive, accessible and effective learning environments for all, Recalling also the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030 — towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, adopted at the World Education Forum 2015, held in Incheon, Republic of Korea, from 19 to 22 May 2015, Noting with appreciation the work carried out by all relevant organs, bodies and mechanisms of the United Nations system within their respective mandates, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the United Nations Population Fund and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the efforts of organizations and civil society to promote all girls’ full and equal enjoyment of the right to education, Recognizing that the right to education is a multiplier right that supports the empowerment of all women and girls to claim their human rights, including the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs, as well as in economic, social and cultural life, and to fully, equally and meaningfully participate in the decision-making processes that shape society, and the transformative potential of education for every girl, Reaffirming the equal right of every child to education without discrimination of any kind, and concerned by the continuation of the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination faced by girls, Recognizing that gender stereotypes about the role of women and girls underpin many of the barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of access to at least 12 years of quality education, and that stereotypes are also perpetuated in school curricula and materials, Deeply concerned by the wide-ranging, negative impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the equal right of every child to education and on the realization of the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl, as an estimated 11 million girls are at risk of not returning to school, Deeply concerned also by the mass school closures and the estimated 58 million children who were not enrolled in primary school prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which approximately 54 per cent were girls, Deeply concerned further that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of all women and girls and their access to education, and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence, and violence and sexual harassment in digital contexts, during lockdowns, are deepening already existing inequalities and risks, reversing the progress made in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in recent decades, Recognizing that, despite gains in providing access to quality education, rural girls are still more likely than rural boys to remain excluded from education and that among the gender-specific barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of their right to education are the feminization of poverty, child labour undertaken by girls, child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, early and repeat pregnancies, all forms of violence, including gender-based violence, abuse and harassment on the way to, from and at school and in the technology-mediated environment, the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work performed by girls, and gender stereotypes and negative social norms that lead families A/HRC/47/L.3 and communities to place less value on the education of girls than that of boys and may influence the decision of parents to allow girls to attend school, Noting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its worst forms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and affected by armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without nationality or birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child labour and that many children face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with unpaid care and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood and hamper the full enjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent employment in the future, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meets the needs of girls, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and education thereon and are excluded and stigmatized, and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, including in accessing at least 12 years of quality education, Deeply concerned also that humanitarian crises and armed conflicts are depriving children, especially girls and girls with disabilities, of access to education, and that this has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in girls being two and a half times more likely than boys to be out of school in these settings, Deploring attacks on and abductions of girls because they attend or wish to attend school, as well as all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions as such, their students and staff, and during girls’ journeys to school, and strongly recognizing the negative impact that such attacks have on the progressive realization of the right to education, in particular of girls, and the obligations of States to provide an enabling and secure environment to ensure the safety of schools, Noting that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected persons in vulnerable situations and that marginalized girls are at a high risk of not returning to school, Stressing the crucial importance of the contribution of parliamentarians, national human rights

peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the mandate, Stressing that the primacy of politics should be the hallmark of the approach of the United Nations to the resolution of conflict, including through mediation, good offices, the monitoring of ceasefires, assistance to the implementation of peace accords, Underscoring the importance of peacekeeping as one of the most effective tools available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, reaffirming that lasting peace is neither achieved nor sustained by military and technical engagements alone, but through political solutions and strongly Please recycle eS 21-12640 Hi 130921 NN A 8/2021/771 convinced that this should guide the design and deployment of United Nations peace operations, and understanding United Nations peace operations as peacekeeping operations and special political missions, Recognising the crucial role peacekeeping plays in creating conditions for stability and lasting peace, and the need for United Nations peace operations to have integrated strategies that articulate a clear pathway to transition and to achieving sustainable peace, and underlining that transitions of United Nations Peace Operations are understood as a strategic process which builds towards a reconfiguration of the strategy, footprint, and capacity of the United Nations in a way that supports peacebuilding objectives and the development of a sustainable peace, in a manner that supports and reinforces national ownership, informed by the operational context and the national priorities and needs of the host State and its population, and that includes engagement with local community and civil society, and, where relevant, regional and sub-regional organisations, and other relevant stakeholders, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and the inclusion of youth and persons with disabilities, Reiterating the primary responsibility of States to protect the population throughout their territories, recognising that reconfigurations of missions may entail increased risks for civilians, in particular for women, youth, children, persons with disabilities, and, where relevant, the need to enhance States’ capacity to protect their own civilians, emphasising the importance of security sector reform, poverty reduction measures, gender equality, human rights monitoring and reporting, the promotion of rule of law and good governance, and the extension of legitimate State authority in ensuring the protection of civilians over the longer term and in the consolidation of peace and stability, taking note of interlinkages between transitional justice,

persons within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction as provided for by international law, and acknowledging the important role of those who protect and promote human rights, civil society organisations, journalists and other media workers in the promotion and protection of human rights, Reaffirming its commitment to addressing the impact of armed conflict on women, youth, and children,

subsequent resolutions concerning these agendas, Reaffirming its commitment to include in the mandates of peace operations a desired outcome of the implementation of sequenced, mandated tasks and, where appropriate, a clear prioritisation of tasks to achieve this outcome, reflecting the need to create favourable conditions for sustainable peace, understanding prioritisation as the mission focussing on those specific mandated tasks which are based on up-to-date conflict analysis and planning and are assessed as responding to the evolving needs on the ground, and further understanding sequencing as a logical, flexible implementation of the mandate over time, in line with the strategic vision as set out 2/6 S/2021/771 in the mandate, aligned with the peace and security needs within the host State, building towards a consolidation of peace, Recognising that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is the responsibility of all stakeholders and is contingent upon several critical factors, including well-defined, realistic and achievable mandates, political will, leadership, performance and accountability at all levels, adequate resources, policy, planning and operational guidelines and training and equipment, and welcoming further engagement and dialogue between United Nations, troop and police contributing countries, and other relevant stakeholders to improve performance and inform decisions regarding mandate design, Reaffirming its belief that United Nations peacekeeping, including mission transition processes, is a unique global partnership that

improving the safety and security of peacekeepers, implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda, supporting effective performance and accountability, improving peacekeeping partnerships, strengthening the conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel, and strengthening the impact of peacekeeping on peacebuilding and sustaining peace, Reaffirming that “sustaining peace” should be broadly understood as a goal and a process to build a common vision of a society, ensuring that the needs and human rights of all segments of the population are taken into account, which encompasses activities, including promotion of justice and accountability, aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, addressing root causes, assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction and development, and emphasising that sustaining peace is a shared task and responsibility
