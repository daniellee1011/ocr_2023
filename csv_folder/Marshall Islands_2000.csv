Permanent Mission of the Kingdom of Swaziland to the United Nations A/55/227 Annex I to the letter dated 3 August 2000 from the representatives of Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Grenada, Honduras, Malawi, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Nicaragua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Solomon Islands and Swaziland to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Explanatory memorandum As Tuvalu of the South Pacific is to be admitted to the United Nations later this year, the Republic of China on Taiwan will then be the only country in the world that remains excluded from the United Nations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to examine this situation from a whole new perspective and redress this mistaken omission. There are many reasons why the Republic of China should have the right to play a role in the United Nations: The Republic of China is a democratic country and its democratically elected Government is the sole legitimate one that can actually represent the interests and wishes of the people of Taiwan in the United Nations. The Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China have coexisted on their respective sides of the Taiwan Strait, with neither subject to the other’s rule. Over that past half-century, each side has developed its own political system, social values and foreign relations. Therefore, each of these two sides can speak for and represent only the people actually under its jurisdiction on its respective side of the Taiwan Strait. The exclusion of the Republic of China from the United Nations and its related agencies has created a major and serious obstacle for both the Government and the people of the Republic of China in their pursuit of normal participation in international organizations and activities. From 1950 to 1971, the United Nations considered the question of China’s representation. In October 1971, at its twenty-sixth session, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI), in which it decided that the China seat would be taken by the People’s Republic of China. That resolution, however, failed to address the issue of legitimate representation for the people of Taiwan in the United Nations. Worse still, while the representatives of the Government of the Republic of China are excluded from all United Nations activities, the Republic of China’s lack of membership in the United Nations and General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) have too often been used as pretexts to deter or discourage the participation of individuals and non-governmental groups of the Republic in United Nations activities and all activities related to all functions of the Economic and Social Council. This unjust exclusion of civil associations and individuals of the Republic of China runs counter to the predominant trend of involving all possible participants in international affairs and the United Nations call for global and comprehensive partnership. A/55/227 The Republic of China, a country with significant achievements, is a constructive and responsible member of the international community. The Republic of China has played a positive role in promoting world trade, eradicating poverty and advancing human rights, a fact that merits recognition by Members of the United Nations. The Republic of China has a population of 23 million and a democratic system. Above all, it is a peace-loving country, which is able and willing to carry out the obligations contained in the Charter of the United Nations. Today the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan enjoy a high degree of freedom and democracy. The Republic held its first direct presidential election in March 1996, the first time in history that the Republic elected its highest leader by popular vote. In March 2000, Mr. Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected in the second direct presidential election, marking the first-ever change of political parties for the presidency of the Republic of China. Since Mr. Chen’s inauguration on 20 May 2000, the people of the Republic have witnessed a peaceful transition of power as a result of a democratic election. The Republic of China is one of the most successful examples of economic development in the twentieth century and is now the world’s nineteenth largest economy in terms of GNP, and the fourteenth most important trading country. It is also a major investor in East Asia and possesses the third largest amount of foreign reserves in the world. The Republic of China is also a humanitarian-minded country. Over the years it has sent over 10,000 experts to train technicians in countries all over the world, especially the countries of Asia, the South Pacific, Latin America and Africa, to help develop their agricultural, fishery and livestock industries. It also has provided billions of United States dollars in disaster relief throughout the world, including the People’s Republic of China, over the past several years, and has responded to United Nations appeals for emergency relief and rehabilitation assistance to countries suffering from natural disasters and wars. Currently, the Republic of China contributes capital to regional development programmes through international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank, the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, the Inter- American Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Republic of China is fully committed to observing the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to its integration into the international human rights system spearheaded by the United Nations. The United Nations should take note of the recent conciliatory gestures of the Republic of China towards the People’s Republic of China and play a facilitating role by providing a forum for their reconciliation and rapprochement. On 20 June 2000, President Chen called upon the leader of the People’s Republic of China, President Jiang Zemin, to work together to bring about a historic summit like that just held between North and South Korea. He indicated that he would be willing to sit down with Mr. Jiang to pursue cross-strait reconciliation, without specifying any preconditions, format or location. He also urged the leaders A/55/227 of the two sides to use their wisdom and creativity, based on the principles of democracy and parity, to jointly create a favourable environment for the betterment of cross-strait relations. He further voiced the hope that the leaders of the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China would respect the free choice of the people on both sides and work together to resolve the question of a future “one- China”. As an organization dedicated to the preservation and maintenance of world peace, the United Nations should facilitate a reconciliation and peace process between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The United Nations can serve as a forum to foster mutual understanding and goodwill between the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China so that confidence-building measures can be developed in time, thus reducing cross-strait tension. The participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations poses no barrier to the future peaceful resolution of the differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait; indeed, it can be conducive to regional peace and security. The examples of the former East Germany and West Germany, and now of the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, serve as precedents for parallel representation of divided nations in the United Nations. The exchanges between East Germany and West Germany via the United Nations and other international organizations contributed not only to regional peace and security, but also to their peaceful unification in 1990. The simultaneous admission of two Koreas into the United Nations in 1991 also helped to build mutual trust and confidence between the two, which culminated in the June 2000 summit. The strategic position of Taiwan makes it a focal point of the entire Asia and Pacific region. Accordingly, the stability of the Taiwan Strait and its periphery is vital to the maintenance of peace and security for the region in particular and for the world in general. In the absence of an institutionalized crisis-management mechanism that covers the relations across the Taiwan Strait, a role for the Republic of China on Taiwan in the United Nations would bring the area under the peace and security mechanism contained in the United Nations, thus enhancing the maintenance of peace and security in the region. The United Nations should therefore encourage both sides of the Taiwan Strait to work and cooperate in the Organization and its related organizations. The General Assembly should act to ensure that the voice of the 23 million people on Taiwan is heard in the United Nations and its related organizations. Tremendous changes have taken place globally in the past two decades. The world is faced with increasingly demanding tasks in eradicating disease and poverty, protecting the environment and endangered species, regulating human migration and population growth, and promoting human rights and dignity. Many of those issues call for global and comprehensive efforts that transcend traditional national boundaries. To be more effective and efficient, these joint efforts require not only broad support and cooperation from national Governments, but also greater involvement and participation from local governments, civil associations and even individuals. As the world organization with the most comprehensive functions, the United Nations system should invite every possible participant of the international A/55/227 community to join the partnership to further the objectives and purposes of the United Nations. At the dawning of the new millennium, people around the world welcome the Israeli-Arab peace talks, the summit between the North and South Koreas and the imminent accession of both the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China to the World Trade Organization. All these events signify that reconciliation has replaced confrontation as the dominant spirit of the new century and the mainstream value of the international community. It is high time that the United Nations seriously reconsider the appropriateness of continued exclusion of the Republic of China from this most important global forum. With the participation of the Republic of China, the United Nations can live up to its principle of universality, achieve its goal of preventive diplomacy, and facilitate the cross-strait reconciliation and peace process.

In particular, article 287 specifies that States are free to choose one or more of the following means: (a) (b) (c) (d) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea; The International Court of Justice; An arbitral tribunal; A special arbitral tribunal. 2. The Secretary-General already operates a Trust Fund for the International Court of Justice (see A/47/444). The Permanent Court of Arbitration has established a Financial Assistance Fund. The burden of costs should not be a factor for States, in making the choices under article 287, in deciding whether a dispute should be submitted to the Tribunal, or in deciding upon the response to an application made to the Tribunal by others. For these reasons, it was decided to create a Trust Fund for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (“the Tribunal™). Object and purpose of the Trust Fund 3. This Trust Fund (“the Fund”) is established by the Secretary-General in accordance with General Assembly resolution XXX and pursuant to the Agreement on Cooperation and Relationship between the United Nations and the Tribunal of 18 December 1997 (General Assembly resolution 52/251, annex). 4. The purpose of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to States parties to the Convention for expenses incurred in connection with cases submitted, or to be submitted, to the Tribunal, including its Seabed Disputes Chamber and any other Chamber. 5. Assistance, which will be provided in accordance with the following terms and conditions, should only be provided in appropriate cases, principally those proceeding to the merits where jurisdiction is not an issue, but in exceptional circumstances may be provided for any phase of the proceedings. Contributions to the Fund 6. The Secretary-General invites States, intergovernmental organizations, national institutions, non-governmental organizations, as well as natural and juridical persons, to make voluntary financial contributions to the Fund. Application for assistance 7. An application for assistance from the Fund may be submitted by any State party to the Convention. The application should describe the nature of the case which is to be, or has been, brought by or against the State concerned and should 10 provide an estimate of the costs for which financial assistance is requested. The application should contain a commitment to supply a final statement of account of the expenditures made from approved amounts, to be certified by an auditor acceptable to the United Nations. Panel of experts 8. The Secretary-General will establish a panel of experts, normally three persons of the highest professional standing, to make recommendations on each request. The task of each panel is to examine the application and to recommend to the Secretary- General the amount of the financial assistance to be given, the phase or phases of the proceedings in respect of which assistance is to be given and the types of expenses for which the assistance may be used. Granting of assistance 9. The Secretary-General will provide financial assistance from the Fund on the basis of the recommendations of the panel of experts. Payments will be made against receipts showing expenditures made in respect of approved costs. The latter may include: (a) Preparing the application and the written pleadings; (b) Professional fees of counsel and advocates for written and oral pleadings; (c) Travel and expenses of legal representation in Hamburg during the various phases of a case; (d) Execution of an Order of Judgment of the Tribunal, such as marking a boundary in the territorial sea. Application of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations 10. The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations will apply to the administration of the Fund, including the procedures for audit. Reporting 11. An annual report on the activities of the Fund, including details of the contributions to and disbursements from the Fund, will be made to the Meeting of States Parties to the Convention. Implementing office 12. The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs is the implementing office for this Fund and provides the services for the operation of the Fund. Offers of professional assistance 13. The implementing office also maintains a list of offers of professional assistance which may be made on a reduced fee basis by suitably qualified persons or bodies. If an applicant for assistance so requests, the implementing office will make the list of offers available to it for its consideration and decision; both 11 financial and other assistance may be extended in respect of the same case or phase thereof. Revision 14. The General Assembly may revise the above if circumstances so require. 12 Annex I1 Trust fund for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, and compliance with article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Terms of reference, guidelines and rules Reasons for establishing the Trust Fund 1. Promoting and developing the marine scientific and technological capacity of developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island States, with a view to accelerating their social and economic development, is essential for the effective implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“the Convention”). 2. Coastal States intending to establish the outer limits of their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of their territorial sea is measured are required by article 76 of the Convention to submit the relevant data and information to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (“the Commission”). In accordance with article 4 of annex II to the Convention, the particulars of such limits should be submitted to the Commission within ten years of the entry into force of the Convention for that State. For some States a submission should be made by 16 November 2004. 3. Developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, may face difficulties in complying with the time limit for submissions to the Commission. The Trust Fund is intended to assist these States in complying with the requirements relating to a submission to the Commission. 4. Under article 3, paragraph 1 (b), of annex II to the Convention, the Commission may provide scientific and technical advice, if requested by the coastal States concerned, during the preparation of the data to be submitted in accordance with article 76. 5. The Commission has adopted an outline for a five-day training course in order to facilitate the preparation of submissions in accordance with its Scientific and Technical Guidelines. The course is to be developed and delivered by interested Governments, international organizations and institutions which possess the necessary expertise and facilities. The Commission has likewise prepared a basic flow chart illustrating the preparation of submissions by coastal States. 6. The delineation of the continental shelf of a coastal State in accordance with article 76 and annex II to the Convention and annex II of the Final Act of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (“the Final Act”) requires a programme for hydrographic and geoscientific surveying and mapping of the continental margin. The complexity and scale, and hence the costs involved, of such a programme will vary greatly from State to State according to the different geographical and geophysical circumstances. A first approach will always involve an assessment of the particular case at hand, followed by planning of appropriate projects for further data acquisition. Such projects require the contracting of high- 13 level scientific/technical expertise and modern technology. By nature, the costs involved in such data acquisition projects are substantial. In addition to contributing to the Voluntary Fund herein established, the international community should make every effort to facilitate the full implementation of article 76 both financially and in any other possible way or capacity. 7. The initial assessment and the project planning itself will require qualifications in hydrography and geosciences in addition to a full understanding of the relevant provisions of the Convention. The final preparation of a submission to the Commission also requires high-level expertise in geosciences and hydrography. 8. The United Nations has extensive experience in providing assistance to countries for their industrial and economic development. This experience could be extended and utilized to assist States in implementing their rights and obligations under article 76 of the Convention. Objects and purpose of the Trust Fund 9. The Secretary-General, under the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, establishes the present Trust Fund (“the Fund”). The object of the Fund is to enable developing States, in particular the least developed coastal countries and small island developing States, to make an initial assessment of their particular case, make appropriate plans for further investigations and data acquisition, and to prepare the final submission documents when the necessary data have been acquired. 10. The data acquisition campaigns themselves are not the object of the Fund. 11. An initial assessment of the nature of the continental shelf of a coastal State is often made in the form of a desktop study, which is a review and compilation of all existing data and information. Decisions for further action and/or planning for further data acquisition and mapping projects will be based on such a study. 12. The purpose of the Fund is to provide, in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations: (a) Training to the appropriate technical and administrative staff of the coastal State in question, in order to enable them to perform initial desktop studies and project planning, or at least to take full part in these activities; (b) Funds for such studies and planning activities, including funds for advisory/consultancy assistance if needed. 13. The preparation of the final submission documents will have to meet the requirements of article 76 and annex II to the Convention (and for some States, annex II of the Final Act) and the Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission. The training should take this into account and aim at enabling the State’s personnel also to prepare most of these documents themselves. The preparation of the submission may induce costs that may be met by funds from the Fund (e.g. software and hardware equipment, technical assistance, etc.). 14 Contributions to the Fund 14. The Secretary-General invites States, intergovernmental organizations and agencies, national institutions, non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions as well as natural and juridical persons to make voluntary financial or other contributions to the Fund. Application for financial assistance 15. An application for financial assistance from the Fund may be submitted by any developing State, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, who are Members of the United Nations and party to the Convention. 16. The purpose of the financial assistance applied for should be specified. Financial assistance may be sought for the following purposes: (a) Training of technical and administrative staff; (b) Desktop study or other means to make an initial assessment of the nature of the continental shelf and its limits; (c) Working out plans for the acquisition of necessary additional data and mapping projects; (d) Preparation of final submission documents; (e) Advisory/consultancy assistance related to the above points. 17. Detailed information under each of these purposes should be provided as follows: (a) Training of technical and administrative staff The application shall be accompanied by: (i) A specification of the goal of the training and which positions the trainees are intended to fill afterwards; (i1) Information on the training institute(s) in question; (iii) A copy of the training course(s); (iv) The curriculum vitae of the trainees; (v) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested.

In all these cases the application shall be accompanied by an undertaking that the requesting State shall supply a final statement of account providing details of the expenditures made from the approved amounts, to be certified by an auditor acceptable to the United Nations. Consideration of applications 19. Each request for financial assistance shall be considered by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs (“the Division”), which acts as the secretariat of the Commission. 20. The Division may engage an independent panel of experts of the highest moral standing to assist in the examination of applications on the basis of section 4 above and to recommend the amount of financial assistance to be given. However, no sitting Commission member should serve on this panel of experts. The Division shall prepare and circulate to member States a list of prospective members of the 16 panel of experts. Any member of the expert panel opposed by a member State should not be included in the panel. The Division shall on an annual basis provide a list of the panel of experts as an annex to the Secretary-General’s annual report. 21. In considering the application, the Division shall be guided solely by the financial needs of the requesting developing State and availability of funds with priority given to least developed countries and small island developing States taking into account the imminence of pending deadlines. 22. Travel expenses and subsistence allowance are payable to independent experts engaged by the Division to consider applications. Granting of assistance 23. The Secretary-General will provide financial assistance from the Fund on the basis of the evaluation and recommendations of the Division. Payments will be made against receipts evidencing actual expenditures for approved costs. Application of article 5 of annex II to the Convention 24. Nationals of the coastal State making the submission who are members of the Commission and any Commission member who has assisted a coastal State by providing scientific and technical advice with respect to the delineation shall not be a member of the subcommission dealing with that submission but has the right to participate as a member in the proceedings of the Commission concerning the said submission. In an effort to promote transparency and to give full effect to article 5 of annex II to the Convention there should be full disclosure by Commission members, trust fund recipients and training sponsors to the Division of any pre- submission contacts. Reporting requirements for full disclosure 25. Interested Governments, international organizations and institutions who provide any training for which any costs are reimbursed by this Fund are strongly encouraged to provide the complete list of participants to the Division. 26. Commission members who participate in any activities pursuant to this Fund shall disclose this information to the Division. 27. Upon submission to the Commission of its information on the limits of its continental shelf pursuant to article 76 of the Convention, a coastal State that has received assistance from this Fund shall disclose this information, including the involvement of any Commission members. Application of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations 28. The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations shall apply to the administration of the Fund. The Fund shall be subject to the auditing procedures provided therein. 10. Reporting to the General Assembly 29. An annual report on the activities of the Fund, including details of the contributions to and disbursements from the Fund, will be made to the General Assembly. 17 11. Implementing office 30. The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs is the implementing office for the Fund and will provide the services required for the operation of the Fund. 12.
