Recent developments in the region indicate that some of the area’s problems and disputes have been escalating, which might have a serious impact on regional peace and stability. The United Nations, therefore, should adopt necessary measures to strengthen cooperation among all countries in this region in the fields of security, politics, the economy, culture and the environment. Such action would help to effectively resolve the existing problems and disputes, eradicate the roots of tension, and remove threats to regional peace and security deriving from those problems and disputes. The reasons for action are as follows: Sources and threats of conflict in East Asia still exist Rapid economic and trade development in East Asia has depended upon peace in the region, and whether or not growth continues relies heavily upon the maintenance of peace and security. However, long-standing potential threats to East Asian peace and security, which include such issues as ethnic tensions, historical hatred and territorial disputes, have not been properly removed, and some of them have openly surfaced. In addition, there are new factors for potential conflict and other non-traditional threats to security, such as competition for energy and other resources, terrorism and environmental degradation, which could trigger regional political confrontations and even military conflicts. While these are causing much uncertainty in East Asia, what concerns us more is that multilateral cooperation mechanisms in the region play only a very limited role in security issues, and have no function with regard to collective military security. Hence the region cannot cope effectively with the ever more complicated security challenges. Regional flashpoints, whether it be the nuclear crisis in the Korean peninsula or the missile threat in the Taiwan Strait, are likely to deteriorate. On 15 July 2006, the Security Council adopted resolution 1695 (2006) to express its concern over the potential threat that weapons of mass destruction and missile tests represent for peace, stability and security both in the Korean peninsula and beyond. A similar missile threat that exists in the Taiwan Strait also deserves the equal attention of the United Nations. The People’s Republic of China has deployed more than 800 missiles aimed at Taiwan, a number that continues to increase by around 100 missiles per year. This kind of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, missile deployment or test only worsens regional tensions. The United Nations should take necessary preventive and proactive measures to stop the current situation in the Taiwan Strait from deteriorating. A/61/193 Security in East Asia is closely linked to world peace Over the past few years, East Asia has witnessed some of the world’s most vigorous economic development. There are 2 billion people living in the region, accounting for approximately one third of the world’s population. The GDP of countries in this region accounts for one fifth of global GDP, and trade volume accounts for 20 per cent of the world total. Therefore, continued stable development in East Asia is beneficial not only to people’s welfare in the region but also to prosperity and development around the world. However, the arms race that started in East Asia during the cold war continues into the twenty-first century, and East Asia is currently seeing one of the most rapid increases in military expenditure in the world. From 1988 to 2005, military budgets in East Asian countries increased by an average of 71 per cent, compared to an average decrease of 4 per cent in the world for the same period. In violation of the norms of nuclear non-proliferation, the nuclear weapon programmes in the Korean peninsula have caused alarm in countries of this region. The fact that the military budget of China has seen double-digit growth for 18 consecutive years, and that it exports military and related technology to other countries, is causing grave security concerns for neighbouring countries. China’s militarization has created an arms race in the East Asian region that continues to escalate. With the combined advance of both military and economic modernization, peace and development in East Asia have an increasingly significant impact on global politics, economics and security. In a time of increasing interdependence among East Asian countries, enhancing their common interests and solving disputes through peaceful measures and dialogue are important issues that are not only consistent with each individual country’s national interests, but are closely associated with security and development internationally. Based upon this consideration, the United Nations should pay close attention and take the initiative in improving peace and stability in this region. Military transparency and confidence-building are important bases for international security Military transparency is a crucial cornerstone for building confidence and trust between countries, and helps to reduce mistrust and miscalculation. In view of the present security situation in East Asia, bilateral and multilateral confidence-building mechanisms among countries in this region are restricted in scope and limited in effect. The lack of military transparency in some countries makes security relationships among East Asian countries unstable and uncertain. For example, the opaque nature of military development in the Korean peninsula and China’s military expansion are causes for considerable concern and doubt for other countries in the region. Concerned countries have urged China to make its military more transparent, and have emphasized that China should make it clear to other countries how and why it is expanding it military. Considering the regional instability in East Asia, most countries oppose the European Union’s attempt to lift its military embargo against China. The openness and exchange of military intelligence and information are essential in reducing international tensions and preventing international conflicts. In its resolutions 59/87 and 60/64, the General Assembly emphasized that countries should engage in meaningful dialogue to avert conflict, and confirmed that A/61/193 confidence-building measures contribute to regional stability and peace as well as progress in people’s socio-economic conditions. The United Nations, therefore, should be more proactive in encouraging and assisting East Asian countries to promote military transparency and confidence-building measures, thus ensuring that the security dilemmas and miscalculations that can lead to arms races and military conflicts do not transpire. Peaceful means, dialogue and negotiation are necessary for the settlement of disputes Chapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations obliges United Nations Member States to resolve disputes peacefully. Article 33 of the Charter stipulates that “the parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice”. Therefore, any preparations or behaviours that would indicate an attempt to resolve international disputes by non-peaceful means defy the basic principles of the Charter and should be of concern to the international community. In seeking to prevent the use of force in resolving disputes, the United Nations should not only passively assist in avoiding use of force among countries in disputes, but should also actively encourage all countries to enhance mutual understanding and trust through dialogue, negotiation and cooperation. Then, peaceful means to resolve disagreements and disputes among countries can be found. In fact, it has been proved in practice that peaceful means and dialogue are effective methods for resolving disputes and ensuring peace. The nuclear weapon development programmes and missile launches in the Korean peninsula are potential crises for regional peace and stability in North-East Asia. The international community generally considers peaceful means, such as negotiations, an effective way to resolve the Korean peninsula problem. The fact that the Security Council adopted resolution 1695 (2006) is an expression of the expectation that peaceful means and diplomatic measures can solve this tense situation. Moreover, member countries of the European Union, NATO and the G8 have all delivered statements to express their serious concern about the situation in East Asia and to condemn the recent missile testing in the Korean peninsula for gravely threatening regional security and stability. They have also emphasized the importance of multilateral mechanisms, such as international treaties, regulations and so forth. Besides the tension in the Korean peninsula, the situation in the Taiwan Strait also deserves the attention of the United Nations. The People’s Republic of China has conducted missile tests and deployed missiles along its coast aimed at Taiwan. In addition, China adopted its so-called “Anti-Secession Law” to emphasize that it will employ “non-peaceful means and other necessary measures” to resolve cross- strait disputes. Even its military, the People’s Liberation Army, often simulates invasions of Taiwan in order to prepare for resolving Taiwan Strait disputes by war. Such behaviour not only accelerates tension in the Taiwan Strait but also threatens peace and stability in the East Asian region. Many countries, including the United States, Japan and European Union member States, have expressed serious concern and encouraged peaceful means, such as cross-strait dialogue, to resolve disputes. Nevertheless, despite the appeals of many countries for peaceful resolutions to A/61/193 cross-strait issues, China still refuses to abandon its threat to adopt military means against Taiwan, thereby making the people of Taiwan live in constant fear and threatening regional peace. On top of this, East Asia has been lacking an effective security cooperation mechanism, with the security environment becoming subject to an ever-increasing diversity of threats to regional peace. To counter this, only through mutual respect and trust can peace, security and common development be secured among all countries. In addition, the United Nations should unanimously adopt effective actions, while encouraging and assisting States in conflict to enter dialogue and conciliation. It should help alleviate tense situations through diplomatic means under the principle of insistence on peaceful settlements without any preconditions. Maintaining peace and security serves as the aim of the United Nations and foundation of development Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations clearly declares that maintaining international peace and security is one of the major goals of the United Nations. This can be seen from paragraph 1, which proclaims that a purpose of the United Nations is “to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace”. Moreover, paragraph 2 states as a purpose: “to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace”. To celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, the 2005 World Summit issued the 2005 World Summit Outcome to express concerns over peace. Subsequently, on 20 December 2005, the General Assembly, acting concurrently with the Security Council, adopted a resolution establishing the Peacebuilding Commission, thereby proving once again that peace is the focal point of the United Nations in this new century. In pursuance of the principles of that resolution, the United Nations has the obligation to adopt the necessary collective measures to prevent and dissolve potential threats to peace and stability in all regions, including East Asia. As peace and development bring hope for the well-being of all peoples around the world, they represent the two major goals of the United Nations and main topic of contemporary international relations. In the United Nations Millennium Declaration issued in September 2000, Heads of State publicly pledged to take “responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security”. They further clarified that this responsibility “must be shared among the nations of the world”. The maintenance of peace is a prerequisite to development, and economic development is the foundation for maintaining world peace. In other words, peace and development complement each other. Therefore, while the United Nations set the promotion of economic prosperity, social development and human rights as the goals of the millennium, it should not ignore its own important role in international security and peace. As we review the international environment, we must acknowledge that all kinds of factors of conflict, such as ethnicity, religion, territory and resources, all form barricades to A/61/193 global economic development. The United Nations therefore should take concrete steps and measures to prevent and dissolve any possible sources of threats to security and peace. Maintenance of peace in East Asia requires the participation of every country in the region International peace is a complete entity and cannot be divided. Each and every country must bear its share of responsibility for stability and prosperity in the East Asian region. During the process of resolving disputes and promoting peace, any attempt to exclude the concerned countries, especially ones in dispute, hinders the settling of disputes between countries as well as the maintenance of peace and security. To assure the security and peace of East Asia, all countries in this region, including Members and non-Members of the United Nations, have the responsibility to fulfil the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and every regulation of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. To settle international disputes in this region, dialogue and negotiation among the countries involved are necessary. The United Nations should, therefore, encourage countries in conflict to settle their disputes via peaceful means, refrain from any use of force or threat of violence, and avoid behaviour inconsistent with the Charter. In addition, for the endeavour of promoting the security, peace and stability of the East Asian region, the United Nations should ensure that each member of the region has the chance to participate. Only by this means can the prerequisites for mutual trust and communication among countries be created. A/61/193 Annex I1 Draft resolution The General Assembly, Reaffirming that maintaining international peace and security is its principal responsibility, Observing the goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Acknowledging that peace, security, development and human rights relate to and strengthen each other, Emphasizing that the principle of abstaining from the threat to use force or the use of force, which are inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations in international relations, and the principle that international disputes should be settled through peaceful means must be followed, Recognizing that the long-existing tense situation and continuing military activities in certain parts of East Asia impede endeavours to increase security and cooperation in the region, Believing strongly that development within one country and between countries can be achieved only in an environment of peace, security and mutual trust, Reiterating that broad conflict-preventing measures should be taken to eradicate completely the sources of armed conflict and political confrontation in the East Asian region, Acknowledging that East Asian regional security cannot be partitioned and closely relates to international peace and security, Believing firmly that all countries bear the responsibility of making contributions to peace, stability and prosperity in East Asia, Calling upon countries of the East Asian region to engage in dialogue to increase openness, raise transparency and build trust, and, moreover, believing staunchly that such dialogues and measures may benefit the development of harmony among countries, and may make momentous contributions to the prevention of conflicts, Encouraging the United Nations to take more constructive action to promote peace, stability, security and development among East Asian countries, Decides: (a) To urge East Asian countries to settle disputes through peaceful means and encourage concerned countries to take further steps in military transparency and confidence-building; (b) To request the Secretary-General to adopt crucial measures, according to real needs, to ease tense situations, and, if necessary, to invite parties in dispute to provide an explanation to the Security Council or General Assembly; (c) To request the Secretary-General to prepare a report on measures for strengthening security and cooperation in the East Asian region. 06-46456",08/11/2006,2006_581396,Honduras,N/A,yes

However, the rights and interests of the 23 million people of Taiwan, which is excluded from the United Nations, are not upheld and protected by the United Nations. Today, for the following reasons, there is an urgent need to further examine this particular situation and to redress this mistaken omission. Universality is a core principle of the United Nations The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations states that the mission of the United Nations is “to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations, large and small”. This commitment to the principle of universality, for all peoples and all nations, is at the centre of the international system established by the founding fathers of the United Nations in 1945. Furthermore, Article 4 of the Charter invites “all other peace-loving States” to join the Organization. Since the end of the cold war and with the advent of globalization, the work of the United Nations has become increasingly important, and the realization of the principle of universality has taken on a new urgency. With the admission of Timor- Leste, Switzerland and Montenegro, almost all the countries of the world have become members of this ever more truly global Organization — all expect one, Taiwan. After all that the United Nations has achieved towards realizing the principle of universality, the complete exclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations poses a moral and legal challenge to the international community. The United Nations must cease senselessly enforcing a policy of political apartheid against the 23 million people of Taiwan. General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) has not resolved the issue of the representation of the people of Taiwan From 1949 to 1971, the question of the representation of China in the United Nations had been continuously disputed. The General Assembly finally adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI) on 25 October 1971, by which it admitted the People’s Republic of China to the United Nations. This resolution, however, did not address the issue of the representation and participation of the 23 million people of Taiwan in the United Nations. Unfortunately, resolution 2758 (XXVI) has subsequently been misused to justify Taiwan’s exclusion from the United Nations system. With a view to examining its falsehood, we cite the pivot statement of the aforesaid resolution, by which the General Assembly: Decides to restore all its rights to the People’s Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the A/61/194 representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it. It should be noted especially that resolution 2758 (XXVI) addressed only the issue of the representation of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations and all related organizations. It did not determine that Taiwan is a part of the People’s Republic of China, nor did it confer on the People’s Republic of China the right to represent Taiwan or the people of Taiwan in the United Nations and its related organizations. Taiwan has no intention of competing with the People’s Republic of China for the so-called “representation of China”. Taiwan has transformed into a fully fledged modern democracy after a series of political reforms, further illustrating that the above-mentioned resolution does not reflect the objective reality that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have separate ruling Governments and are not subject to each other’s jurisdiction. It also fails to reflect the depth of democracy developed by the people of Taiwan. The United Nations should look squarely at the fact that it is regrettable that the resolution also fails to safeguard the legal right of the 23 million people of Taiwan to participate in the United Nations. Taiwan is a sovereign State and a constructive member of the international community With a population of 23 million, making it the forty-seventh largest population in the world, and a territory consisting of the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, Taiwan enjoys an efficient Government and solid institutions that have proven their capacity to conduct friendly and constructive international relations with many States throughout the world. For example, Taiwan maintains full diplomatic relations with the Holy See and 23 States Members of the United Nations. Taiwan has set up more than 120 embassies, consulates general, representative offices or offices around the world, fully demonstrating that Taiwan is a sovereign country. Moreover, through its full membership, Taiwan plays an active role in several international organizations, including the World Trade Organization, the Asian Development Bank and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Taiwan has never been a local government or province of the People’s Republic of China. On the contrary, ever since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China on 1 October 1949, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been governed separately, with neither side having any control or jurisdiction over the other. The fact that international visitors to Taiwan apply for visas at Taiwan’s representative institutions, and that China’s diplomatic missions cannot provide any visa assistance whatsoever, is an obvious example. Taiwan is a vibrant democratic society and an active international partner In his report entitled “In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all”, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan pointed out correctly, “The right to choose how they are ruled, and who rules them, must be the birthright of all people, and its universal achievement must be a central objective of an Organization devoted to the cause of larger freedom”. Accordingly, the international community should respect public opinion in Taiwan. Taiwan’s A/61/194 achievements in deepening democracy are worthy of the active support of the United Nations. Following the end of four decades of authoritarian rule in Taiwan in 1987, the profound constitutional reforms undertaken made it possible for Taiwan to hold its very first general parliamentary elections in 1992, followed by the first direct presidential election in 1996. In 2000, the second presidential election paved the way to the first peaceful transfer of power from one political party to another. The third direct presidential election of 2004 further demonstrates Taiwan’s commitment to genuine democratization. Taiwan has succeeded in its transition to democracy and in its unrelenting efforts to promote human rights. In his inaugural speech in 2000, President Chen Shui-bian emphasized the importance of democracy and peace for the people of Taiwan: “With our sacred votes, we have proved to the world that freedom and democracy are indisputable universal values, and that peace is the highest goal of humanity”. In his inaugural speech in 2004, he reiterated Taiwan’s firm belief and determination: “Taiwan stands ready to continue in its role as an active participant and contributor to international society — this is the right of Taiwan’s 23 million people; likewise, it is our duty as citizens of the world community.” In recent years, in view of defending and promoting the universal values of freedom, democracy and human rights, Taiwan initiated the founding of the Pacific Democratic Union, established the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, and actively participates in the activities of related non-governmental organizations. Taiwan’s democratic institutions, open society and respect for human rights are achievements recognized the world over. Taiwan serves as an excellent model for all those countries that seek to embrace democracy, human rights and the norms and values of our international community. Taiwan deserves to be taken seriously and accepted by the United Nations. Taiwan’s exclusion from the United Nations constitutes discrimination against its people, depriving them of their fundamental right to benefit from and contribute to the work of the United Nations Regardless of the fact that the People’s Republic of China has no right to, and in fact cannot, represent Taiwan in the international arena, the People’s Republic of China and United Nations officials often mistakenly invoke General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI), mentioned previously, to prevent governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations and even individuals from Taiwan from participating in the activities of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, including all activities related to the Economic and Social Council. This unjust exclusion of Taiwan’s Government, civic organizations and individuals contradicts the fundamental principle of universal participation that the United Nations upholds. It infringes upon the right of the people of Taiwan to be represented in the United Nations system and to engage in, and to make contributions to, the wide range of substantive United Nations programmes for the common interests of all. Examples of this discrimination include: (a) The Taipei Flight Information Region covers 188,400 square kilometres, with 13 major international flight routes and four domestic routes in operation. It A/61/194 provides a huge number of flight information services. However, Taiwan’s Civil Aeronautics Administration is still barred from attending the activities of the International Civil Aviation Organization. As a matter of fact, the Taipei Flight Information Region plays an essential role. It provided about 1.46 million controlled flight services with 24.97 million international passengers arriving in and departing from Taiwan, and processed 1.78 million tons of cargo in 2005. In addition, 34 airlines operate regular flights to and from Taiwan, of which 28 are foreign airlines. In 2005, 181,775 flights arrived in and departed from Taiwan. (b) The Security Council has requested the international community to take action against international terrorism; however, Taiwan is not allowed to participate in the international counter-terrorist cooperation led by the United Nations. Without Taiwan’s participation in appropriate international mechanisms to respond effectively to the Security Council’s call for action on international terrorism, there exists a critical gap in the global network to safeguard against terrorism and money- laundering. (c) An earthquake and tsunamis struck South Asia and South-East Asia on 26 December 2004. The Taiwanese Government, in the spirit of humanitarian sympathy, and in return for the assistance provided by the international community after Taiwan’s 921 Earthquake in 1999, immediately announced that it would donate USS$ 50 million for disaster relief, which ranked as the seventeenth largest relief commitment around the world. In addition, Taiwan’s private sector provided USS$ 150 million for disaster relief. Yet even though it is a major donor country, Taiwan was not allowed to attend various international relief and disaster conferences, such as the Special ASEAN Leaders’ Meeting on the Aftermath of the Earthquake and Tsunami, held in Indonesia on 6 January 2005, the United Nations Ministerial-level Meeting on Humanitarian Assistance to Tsunami-affected Communities held in Geneva by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on 11 January 2005 and the Conference on the Health Aspects of the Tsunami Disaster in Asia held in Phuket, Thailand, by the World Health Organization (WHO) from 4 to 6 May 2005. This is unfair to the people of Taiwan who are eager to help others. Taiwan not only actively participates in the post- tsunami reconstruction projects organized by the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center in the capacity of member, but also hopes to participate in mid- and long-term programmes sponsored by the United Nations and World Health Organization, such as international cooperation related to disaster prevention and the establishment of tsunami warning mechanisms. (d) Although Taiwan’s health administration is responsible for handling the health-related issues of over 20 million international travellers arriving in and departing from Taiwan annually, Taiwan has not been able to participate normally in the international discussion of issues of public health and health policy since it was excluded from WHO in 1972. The normal channel of contact with the technical departments of WHO has also been disrupted. This fact is not only unfair to the 23 million people of Taiwan, but also detrimental to the health of tens of millions of people around the world. The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan in 2003 and the more recent spread of avian flu make it clear that, to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, Taiwan should not be excluded from WHO and must immediately be allowed to participate in WHO and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and all WHO-related activities in a A/61/194 meaningful manner. However, the World Health Assembly still refuses even to consider a proposal to invite Taiwan to participate in its work as an observer. (e) The United Nations Millennium Development Goals show that the international community has listed eliminating poverty and hunger as the number one goal of development and assistance. As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan has cooperated with other countries to eliminate poverty and assist capacity-building. With regard to development, Taiwan has always been willing to share its experience and achievements in development with the international community. It provides financial and technical assistance to allies with their public projects, social development, agricultural development and private sector development through investment, financing and technical assistance. It also provides financial and technical assistance to other developing countries. With regard to the protection of the rights of children and women, Taiwan makes great efforts to enhance the welfare of children and adolescents, and works hard to achieve the goal of gender equality through gender mainstreaming. With respect to disease prevention, Taiwan is willing to make financial and human resource contributions to prevent and treat HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. In terms of environmental protection, Taiwan has abided by environmental protection regulations for a long time and has made efforts towards sustainable global development. It has set up the National Sustainable Development Committee to coordinate public and private resources in promoting sustainable development. In spite of Taiwan’s willingness to make contributions to reach the Millennium Development Goals, it is still excluded by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other United Nations-related agencies and governmental international organizations related to the Millennium Development Goals. In addition, while the world has attached great importance to human rights, and environmental and habitat protection have become the shared responsibility of the world, Taiwan cannot join the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Agenda 21, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and the Kyoto Protocol, and cannot participate in various United Nations-related meetings or activities. It is high time that the United Nations and its specialized agencies stop excluding Taiwan. Taiwan’s inclusion will enable it to contribute to and benefit from the global efforts led by the United Nations, while the continued exclusion of Taiwan greatly diminishes these important efforts and violates the rights of Taiwan’s 23 million people. Taiwan’s long-standing commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and international law and cooperation Taiwan fully recognizes the right of all peoples of the world to join the United Nations by adhering to the principle which was solemnly enshrined in the preamble of the Charter itself: “We, the peoples of the United Nations”. Taiwan is also fully aware that Member States also have obligations and duties to fulfil as responsible international actors. Moreover, Article 56 of the Charter enjoins all nations to A/61/194 “pledge themselves to take joint and separate action” for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55. Taiwan is willing to carry out these solemn obligations because it adheres unconditionally to the United Nations ideals of international peace and security, respect for human rights and sustainable development. In addition, with its internationally recognized achievements and progress in economic and social development, Taiwan stands ready to share its unique experience with other nations. Over the past 50 years, through hard work and sacrifice, Taiwan has today become the world’s seventeenth largest economy, the world’s sixteenth largest trading country, and the holder of the third largest foreign exchange reserves. According to a world competitiveness report issued by the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland, among the 61 economies surveyed in 2006, Taiwan ranked eighteenth. Furthermore, a competitiveness report issued by the World Economic Forum showed that among the 104 countries considered in 2005, Taiwan ranked fourth. This outstanding economic growth has already greatly contributed to both regional and global prosperity, and is a crucial asset for Taiwan to carry out all of the obligations of the Charter of the United Nations. As an example of successful economic development and democratic progress, Taiwan’s experience could have a positive impact on many developing nations. Taiwan has always been willing to share this unique experience with the rest of the world by engaging constructively in various foreign assistance and humanitarian and relief programmes. It is to be recalled that foreign aid played a crucial role in the early stages of Taiwan’s own economic and social development. The people of Taiwan share the belief that it is now their responsibility to return some of this generosity and cooperation to the rest of the world. In this context, Taiwan witnessed a steady expansion of overseas development assistance. As at June 2006, Taiwan had 36 long-term technical missions stationed in 30 partner countries, focusing in areas as diverse as capacity-building, agriculture, fisheries, horticulture, livestock, handicrafts, medicine, transportation, industry, mining, electricity generation, printing, vocational training, trade and investment. To take agriculture as an example, in 2005 Taiwan dispatched technical missions to 13 countries, assisting local farmers to implement rice growing projects. The total size of rice production under the assistance of Taiwan’s technical missions was 14,948 hectares, and rice production reached 77,158 tons that year. In the area of humanitarian assistance, Taiwan is also playing an increasingly active role. Taiwan allocates approximately 100,000 tons of rice annually as humanitarian foreign aid. After the South Asian tsunami in December 2004, the Taiwanese Government provided US$ 50 million in initial relief assistance and also cooperated with international non-governmental organizations such as Helen Keller International and Mercy Corps in relief efforts. It also provided more than 355 tons of relief materials to tsunami-affected countries. In 2005, Taiwan’s non- governmental organizations donated 25,504 tons of rice to Indonesia, Laos and Sri Lanka, and early in 2006 donated 8,500 tons to Pakistan, Lesotho and Swaziland. In addition, both Taiwan’s public and private sectors actively devote themselves to international medical relief and the urgent prevention and treatment of diseases. In October 2005, when an earthquake struck on the border between Pakistan and India, both Taiwan’s public and private sectors immediately sent medical and relief teams to the disaster areas to help based on humanitarian A/61/194 considerations. When a mudslide caused severe hardship in the Philippines in February 2006, the Taiwanese Government immediately provided medical equipment and donated US$ 100,000. In May 2006, the Java area of Indonesia was struck by a strong earthquake, which caused severe casualties, death and great loss. Taiwan sent three medical missions to the area to provide urgent medical assistance and donated nearly US$ 200,000 of medicine and medical equipment. At a time when the world closely watches the threat of avian flu, Taiwan donated 600,000 capsules of Tamiflu to Viet Nam in July 2005. Taiwan also sent medical experts to Burkina Faso, Indonesia and Chad to assist with avian flu prevention. These and other similar efforts demonstrate that, although excluded from many major multilateral assistance funds and projects, and although unable to fully participate in international cooperation, Taiwan still does its best to utilize all possible channels to contribute significantly to the development of peoples in many countries all over the world. Of course, Taiwan’s endeavours would be much more effective if they could be coordinated with international efforts undertaken by the United Nations and its specialized agencies. In a time of increasingly serious resource gaps in many vitally important programmes, refusing to work with a willing partner like Taiwan is unreasonable, if not truly irresponsible. As a nation founded on human rights, Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations would help to achieve the universality of human rights As a democracy and a responsible contributor to the world democratic community, Taiwan devotes itself to protecting and promoting universal human rights. Its Government makes efforts to allow Taiwan to integrate into the international human rights system and promises to abide by the rules and standards of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, to bring Taiwan into line with international human rights standards. In order to attain these goals, Taiwan has fully abided by the Paris Principles by setting up an independent national human rights committee. The 2003 Human Rights Award received by President Chen Shui- bian from the International League of Human Rights reflects the world’s recognition of Taiwan’s efforts in promoting human rights. It is regrettable that Taiwan has no choice but to accept the consequences of being forced to be absent from various major international cooperation systems. On 16 March 2006, the General Assembly adopted a historic resolution to set up the Human Rights Council. It is a pity that the Council is limited by the reality of international politics and is unlikely to be able to help the 23 million people of Taiwan to obtain the basic right to participate in international affairs. This is a major gap in that mechanism. Atrticle 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind”, and that “no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs”. Therefore, refusing the 23 million people of Taiwan participation in the United Nations means violating the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It violates the human rights of the Taiwanese people, hampers the goal of universality of the Universal Declaration and will become a source of great A/61/194 regret and irony in the history of the development of human rights. The United Nations should bring Taiwan’s remarkable achievements into its fold to complete the establishment of the protection of global human rights and to bring about the ultimate goal of the universality of human rights. Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations will help maintain peace, prosperity and stability in Asia and the Pacific Stable and peaceful relations across the Taiwan Strait are critical to a lasting peace, security and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. As the global forum for dialogue, the United Nations could provide a platform of dialogue and mutual trust- building by promoting opportunities for reconciliation and rapprochement between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China. President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan has repeatedly called for the peaceful settlement of political disputes between the two sides, and has in the past six years openly made peace and goodwill gestures to the other side of the Strait more than 40 times. Taiwan has also taken steps to normalize trade relations with the People’s Republic of China so as to pave the way for political reconciliation. President Chen also stated in his videoconference with the international press in New York on 15 September 2004: “Should it accept Taiwan, the United Nations would certainly provide a most effective international monitoring mechanism for the development of a framework of peace and stability between the two sides of the Strait. Indeed, it would be able to exercise a decisive influence on peace in the Taiwan Strait and the security of the Asia-Pacific region”. Although China ignored the strong opposition from the international community by unilaterally adopting the so-called “anti-secession law” on 14 March 2005, President Chen still urged on 16 March of the same year, “We are glad to see the People’s Republic of China’s stable emergence, but the Chinese authorities should demonstrate to the international community their ‘peaceful awakening’”. He further stated that “both sides of the Taiwan Strait should use dialogue based on the principles of democracy, freedom and peace to resolve disputes. Any non- democratic or non-peaceful means, regardless of excuses shall not be accepted by the international community and will further worsen cross-strait relations, as well as alienate the feelings of the two peoples”. President Chen also stressed in his 2006 New Year address that “regardless of future cross-strait relations, they should be in line with the four principles of sovereignty, democracy, peace and equality. This is the will of the majority of Taiwanese people”. We should point out that in 2002, both Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China became full members of the World Trade Organization, which has the potential to serve as a constructive platform for dialogue on trade and economic issues between the two sides. Likewise, the United Nations and its specialized agencies can provide a multilateral forum for contacts on a wider range of issues. This positive interaction will help build trust and confidence between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China and thus contribute to peace, prosperity and stability in Asia and the Pacific. 10 A/61/194 The representation of Taiwan in the United Nations will benefit all humankind As previously stated, Taiwan is a democratic society full of vitality. It is also an active international partner. If Taiwan’s 23 million people were to have representation in the United Nations and be able to participate in the United Nations and related agencies, it would fulfil the principle of universality in membership, making the world body more representative, comprehensive and effective. It would also contribute to maintaining international peace and security and to enhancing international cooperation in political, economic, social and cultural development, as well as in human rights and humanitarian affairs. At the same time, it would help the United Nations Millennium Development Goals to be realized earlier. More importantly, this is a realistic and rational arrangement in line with the status quo of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The 23 million people of Taiwan need the United Nations and the United Nations needs the 23 million people of Taiwan! 11 A/61/194 Annex I1 Draft resolution The General Assembly, Considering, with concern, the fact that the 23 million people of Taiwan are the only remaining people in the world who still lack representation in the United Nations, which violates the principles and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, in particular the fundamental principle of universality, and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Recalling that General Assembly resolution 2758 (XXVI) addressed only the issue of the representation of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations and all related organizations, did not determine that Taiwan is a part of the People’s Republic of China, and did not confer on the People’s Republic of China the right to represent the Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as Taiwan) or the people of Taiwan in the United Nations and all related organizations, Noting the fact that, since its establishment in 1949, the People’s Republic of China has never exercised any control or jurisdiction over Taiwan, nor has the Government of Taiwan ever exercised any control or jurisdiction over the territory of the People’s Republic of China, Noting also that Taiwan has transformed itself into a free, democratic State after terminating four decades of authoritarian rule, Acknowledging that the democratically elected Government in Taiwan is the sole legitimate Government that can represent Taiwan and the people of Taiwan in the United Nations and the international community, Observing that the people of Taiwan and their elected leaders are committed to the universal values of democracy, freedom and human rights, as well as to the enhancement of international cooperation on economic, social and cultural development and humanitarian assistance, Mindful of the importance of the strategic position of Taiwan in the Asia- Pacific region, and that the participation of Taiwan in the United Nations will contribute significantly to the maintenance of international peace and security in that region through preventive diplomacy, Decides: (@) To recognize the right of the 23 million people of Taiwan to representation in the United Nations system and invite Taiwan’s representative to participate in the meetings and activities of the United Nations and its related agencies; (b) To take appropriate measures to implement paragraph (a) of this resolution. 06-46412 12",08/11/2006,2006_581467,Honduras,N/A,yes

Reaffirms its recognition, as stated in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space, that the legal regime applicable to outer space does not in and of itself guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space, that the regime plays a significant role in the prevention of an arms race in that environment, that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce that regime and enhance its effectiveness and that it is important to comply strictly with existing agreements, both bilateral and multilateral; 3.

No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance. Article 2 For the purposes of this Convention, “enforced disappearance” is considered to be the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the A/C.3/61/L.17 deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which places such a person outside the protection of the law. Article 3 Each State Party shall take appropriate measures to investigate acts defined in article 2 committed by persons or groups of persons acting without the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State and to bring those responsible to justice. Article 4 Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence under its criminal law. Article 5 The widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable international law and shall attract the consequences provided for under such applicable international law.

Each State Party shall make the offence of enforced disappearance punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account its extreme seriousness. A/C.3/61/L.17 2. Each State Party may establish: (a) Mitigating circumstances, in particular for persons who, having been implicated in the commission of an enforced disappearance, effectively contribute to bringing the disappeared person forward alive or make it possible to clarify cases of enforced disappearance or to identify the perpetrators of an enforced disappearance; (b) Without prejudice to other criminal procedures, aggravating circumstances, in particular in the event of the death of the disappeared person or the commission of an enforced disappearance in respect of pregnant women, minors, persons with disabilities or other particularly vulnerable persons.

This Convention does not exclude any additional criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with national law. Article 10 1. Upon being satisfied, after an examination of the information available to it, that the circumstances so warrant, any State Party in whose territory a person suspected of having committed an offence of enforced disappearance is present shall A/C.3/61/L.17 take him or her into custody or take such other legal measures as are necessary to ensure his or her presence. The custody and other legal measures shall be as provided for in the law of that State Party but may be maintained only for such time as is necessary to ensure the person’s presence at criminal, surrender or extradition proceedings. 2. A State Party which has taken the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall immediately carry out a preliminary inquiry or investigations to establish the facts.

Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article may communicate immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he or she is a national, or, if he or she is a stateless person, with the representative of the State where he or she usually resides. Article 11 1. The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed an offence of enforced disappearance is found shall, if it does not extradite that person or surrender him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrender him or her to an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized, submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. 2. These authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State Party. In the cases referred to in article 9, paragraph 2, the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in article 9, paragraph 1. 3. Any person against whom proceedings are brought in connection with an offence of enforced disappearance shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings. Any person tried for an offence of enforced disappearance shall benefit from a fair trial before a competent, independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law. Article 12 1. Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance has the right to report the facts to the competent authorities, which shall examine the allegation promptly and impartially and, where necessary, undertake without delay a thorough and impartial investigation. Appropriate steps shall be taken, where necessary, to ensure that the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person and their defence counsel, as well as persons participating in the investigation, are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of the complaint or any evidence given. 2. Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance, the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of A/C.3/61/L.17 this article shall undertake an investigation, even if there has been no formal complaint. 3. Each State Party shall ensure that the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article: (a) Have the necessary powers and resources to conduct the investigation effectively, including access to the documentation and other information relevant to their investigation; (b) Have access, if necessary with the prior authorization of a judicial authority, which shall rule promptly on the matter, to any place of detention or any other place where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the disappeared person may be present. 4. Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to prevent and sanction acts that hinder the conduct of an investigation. It shall ensure in particular that persons suspected of having committed an offence of enforced disappearance are not in a position to influence the progress of an investigation by means of pressure or acts of intimidation or reprisal aimed at the complainant, witnesses, relatives of the disappeared person or their defence counsel, or at persons participating in the investigation. Article 13 1. For the purposes of extradition between States Parties, the offence of enforced disappearance shall not be regarded as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives. Accordingly, a request for extradition based on such an offence may not be refused on these grounds alone. 2. The offence of enforced disappearance shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties before the entry into force of this Convention. 3. States Parties undertake to include the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty subsequently to be concluded between them. 4. If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty, it may consider this Convention as the necessary legal basis for extradition in respect of the offence of enforced disappearance. 5. States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence between themselves. 6. Extradition shall, in all cases, be subject to the conditions provided for by the law of the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties, including, in particular, conditions relating to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse extradition or make it subject to certain conditions. 7. Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the A/C.3/61/L.17 request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person’s sex, race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, political opinions or membership of a particular social group, or that compliance with the request would cause harm to that person for any one of these reasons. Article 14 1. States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual legal assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of an offence of enforced disappearance, including the supply of all evidence at their disposal that is necessary for the proceedings. 2. Such mutual legal assistance shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested State Party or by applicable treaties on mutual legal assistance, including, in particular, the conditions in relation to the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse to grant mutual legal assistance or may make it subject to conditions. Article 15 States Parties shall cooperate with each other and shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual assistance with a view to assisting victims of enforced disappearance, and in searching for, locating and releasing disappeared persons and, in the event of death, in exhuming and identifying them and returning their remains. Article 16 1. No State Party shall expel, return (“refouler”), surrender or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to enforced disappearance. 2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations, including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights or of serious violations of international humanitarian law. Article 17 1. No one shall be held in secret detention. 2.

Each State Party shall assure the compilation and maintenance of one or more up-to-date official registers and/or records of persons deprived of liberty, which shall be made promptly available, upon request, to any judicial or other competent authority or institution authorized for that purpose by the law of the State Party concerned or any relevant international legal instrument to which the State concerned is a party.

Article 19 1. Personal information, including medical and genetic data, which is collected and/or transmitted within the framework of the search for a disappeared person shall not be used or made available for purposes other than the search for the disappeared person. This is without prejudice to the use of such information in criminal proceedings relating to an offence of enforced disappearance or the exercise of the right to obtain reparation. 2. The collection, processing, use and storage of personal information, including medical and genetic data, shall not infringe or have the effect of infringing the human rights, fundamental freedoms or human dignity of an individual. Article 20 1.

In no case shall there be restrictions on the right to information referred to in article 18 that could constitute conduct defined in article 2 or be in violation of article 17, paragraph 1. 2. Without prejudice to consideration of the lawfulness of the deprivation of a person’s liberty, States Parties shall guarantee to the persons referred to in article 18, paragraph 1, the right to a prompt and effective judicial remedy as a means of obtaining without delay the information referred to in article 18, paragraph 1. This right to a remedy may not be suspended or restricted in any circumstances.

Article 22 Without prejudice to article 6, each State Party shall take the necessary measures to prevent and impose sanctions for the following conduct: (a) Delaying or obstructing the remedies referred to in article 17, paragraph 2 (f), and article 20, paragraph 2; (b) Failure to record the deprivation of liberty of any person, or the recording of any information which the official responsible for the official register knew or should have known to be inaccurate; (¢) Refusal to provide information on the deprivation of liberty of a person, or the provision of inaccurate information, even though the legal requirements for providing such information have been met. Article 23 1. Each State Party shall ensure that the training of law enforcement personnel, civil or military, medical personnel, public officials and other persons who may be involved in the custody or treatment of any person deprived of liberty includes the necessary education and information regarding the relevant provisions of this Convention, in order to: (a) Prevent the involvement of such officials in enforced disappearances; (b) Emphasize the importance of prevention and investigations in relation to enforced disappearances; (¢) Ensure that the urgent need to resolve cases of enforced disappearance is recognized. 2.
