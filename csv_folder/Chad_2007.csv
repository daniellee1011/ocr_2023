Considers it intolerable that more than 6 million children still die every year from hunger-related illness before their fifth birthday and that there are about 854 million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 9 See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report on the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006 (Rome, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006). 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Pérto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (c 2006/REP), appendix G.

Encourages all States to take steps with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger, and recognizes in this regard the great efforts and positive developments with respect to the right to food in some developing countries and regions including those highlighted in the interim report of the Special Rapporteur; !1 9. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 10. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs, and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is an element key to food security and provision of the right to food; 11. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; !2 12.
