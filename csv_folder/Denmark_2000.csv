Reaffirms its commitment to the principles contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 2.

Further expresses its concern that high rates of illiteracy continue to exist in the world, and reaffirms that education is an integral component of the full and effective participation of persons in a free society, in particular for the full enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and that the eradication of illiteracy is very important to the achievement of these goals and to the development of the human person; 6. Mindful that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions as set out in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, encourages States to review their procedures and legislation to ensure that any limitations on the right to freedom of expression are only such as are provided by law and are necessary for the respect of the rights and reputations of others, or for the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public) or of public health or morals; 7.

These requirements should be respected. A/C.3/55/L.30 5. (a) In cases in which the established investigative procedures are inadequate because of insufficient expertise or suspected bias, or because of the apparent existence of a pattern of abuse, or for other substantial reasons, States shall ensure that investigations are undertaken through an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure. Members of such a commission shall be chosen for their recognized impartiality, competence and independence as individuals. In particular, they shall be independent of any suspected perpetrators and the institutions or agencies they may serve.
