Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Namibia, Netherlands, Portugal, Russian Federation, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe",N/A,The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts,"The General Assembly, Recognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds is a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in, and proliferation of, armaments, especially small arms and light weapons, Also recognizing the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts, Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security, Recognizing therefore that urgent action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, Also recognizing the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for urgent international action to prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a critical contribution to the economies of many of the producing, exporting and importing States, especially developing States, Noting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from legitimate sources, Recalling all the resolutions related to conflict diamonds of the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter, and determined to contribute to and support the implementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions, Also recalling its resolution 55/56 of 1 December 2000, in which it called upon the international community to develop detailed proposals for a simple and workable international certification scheme for rough diamonds based primarily on national certification schemes and on internationally agreed minimum standards, Believing that the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict can be substantially reduced by introducing an international certification scheme for rough diamonds and that such a scheme would help protect legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on trade in conflict diamonds, Emphasizing that the envisaged international certification scheme for rough diamonds should be simple, effective and pragmatic, should not impede the present legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and should not hinder the development of the diamond industry, Acknowledging the important initiatives already taken to address the problem of conflict diamonds, in particular by the Governments of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea and Sierra Leone and by other key producing, exporting and importing countries, and encouraging those Governments to continue the initiatives, Also acknowledging the continued efforts of regional organizations and other groups of countries to curb conflict diamonds, Welcoming the important contribution made by the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council, as well as civil society, to assist international efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds, Also welcoming voluntary self-regulation initiatives for the diamond industry announced by the World Diamond Council, and recognizing that a system of such voluntary self-regulation will contribute to ensuring the effectiveness of national systems of internal controls for rough diamonds, Recognizing that an international certification scheme for rough diamonds will only be credible if all participants have established internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices as well as differences in institutional controls thereof may require different approaches to meet minimum standards, Welcoming the important contribution made by the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African producing countries towards developing proposals for the envisaged international certification scheme, A/56/L.72 Noting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis, involving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing States, the diamond industry and civil society, Recognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and the principles of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to, 1. Notes with appreciation the report on the Kimberley Processtubmitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55/56, and congratulates the participants in the Kimberley Process on their achievements thus far; 2. Recognizes that the proposed international certification scheme for rough diamonds would also help to ensure the effective implementation of relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on the trade in conflict diamonds, and calls for the full implementation of existing Security Council measures targeting the illicit trade in rough diamonds that play a role in fuelling conflict; 3. Welcomes the detailed proposals for an international certification scheme for rough diamonds developed in the Kimberley Process and presented in the form of Kimberley Process working document 9/2001 (as amended), entitled “Essential elements of an international scheme of certification for rough diamonds, with a view to breaking the link hetween armed conflict and the trade in rough diamonds”, dated 29 November 2001,% which provide a good basis for the proposed certification scheme; 4. Encourages the Kimberley Process to resolve outstanding issues; 5. Emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the measures taken to implement the international certification scheme for rough diamonds are consistent with international law governing international trade; 6. Urges the finalization of the international certification scheme, and its subsequent implementation, as soon as possible, recognizing the urgency of the situation from a humanitarian and security standpoint; 7. Underlines the need, as an essential tool for the successful implementation of the proposed international certification scheme, for the collation and dissemination of relevant statistical data on the production of, and international trade in, rough diamonds; 8. Supports the extension of the work of the Kimberley Process until such time as an international certification scheme is adopted and its simultancous implementation by participants begins; 9. Urges Member States to participate actively in the proposed international certification scheme, and stresses that the widest possible participation in the proposed international certification scheme is essential and should be encouraged and facilitated; 10. Welcomes the offer by the Government of Canada to host the next meeting of the Kimberley Process in Ottawa, in order to achieve further progress; 1 See A/56/502, A/56/675 and A/56/775. 2 See A/56/775, annex VIII.

Adopts the basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters annexed to the present resolution; 2. Urges Member States to utilize the basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters as guidelines for the development and operation of restorative justice programmes; 3. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the basic principles on restorative justice among Member States, the institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network and other international, regional and non-governmental organizations; 4. Calls upon Member States that have adopted restorative justice practices to make information about those practices available to other States upon request; 5. Also calls upon Member States to assist one another in the development and implementation of research, training or other programmes, as well as activities to stimulate discussion and the exchange of experience on restorative justice; 6. Further calls upon Member States to consider, through voluntary contributions, the provision of technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, on request, to assist them in the development of restorative justice programmes. 2 See Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Vienna, 10-17 April 2000, chap. I (A/CONF.187/15). E/CN.15/2002/L.2 Annex Basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters Preamble Recalling that there has been, worldwide, a significant growth of restorative justice initiatives, Recognizing that those initiatives often draw upon traditional and indigenous forms of justice which view crime as fundamentally harmful to people, Emphasizing that restorative justice is an evolving response to crime that respects the dignity and equality of each person, builds understanding, and promotes social harmony through the healing of victims, offenders and communities, Stressing that this approach enables those affected by crime to share openly their feelings and experiences, and aims at addressing their needs, Aware that this approach provides an opportunity for victims to obtain reparation, feel safer and seek closure; allows offenders to gain insight into the causes and effects of their behaviour and to take responsibility in a meaningful way; and enables communities to understand the underlying causes of crime, to promote community well-being and to prevent crime, Noting that restorative justice gives rise to a range of measures that are flexible in their adaptation to established criminal justice systems and that complement those systems, taking into account legal social and cultural circumstances, Recognizing that the use of restorative justice does not prejudice the right of States to prosecute alleged offenders, I. Use of terms 1. “Restorative justice programme” means any programme that uses restorative processes and seeks to achieve restorative outcomes. 2. “Restorative process” means any process in which the victim and the offender, and, where appropriate, any other individuals or community members affected by a crime participate together actively in the resolution of matters arising from the crime, generally with the help of a facilitator. Restorative processes may include mediation, conciliation, conferencing and sentencing circles. 3. “Restorative outcome” means an agreement reached as a result of a restorative process. Restorative outcomes include responses and programmes such as reparation, restitution, and community service, aimed at meeting the individual and collective needs and responsibilities of the parties and achieving the reintegration of the victim and the offender. E/CN.15/2002/L.2 4. “Parties” means the victim, the offender and any other individuals or community members affected by a crime who may be involved in a restorative process. 5. “Facilitator” means a person whose role is to facilitate, in a fair and impartial manner, the participation of the parties in a restorative process. II. Use of restorative justice programmes 6. Restorative justice programmes may be used at any stage of the criminal justice system, subject to national law. 7. Restorative processes should be used only where there is sufficient evidence to charge the offender and with the free and voluntary consent of the victim and the offender. The victim and the offender should be able to withdraw such consent at any time during the process. Agreements should be arrived at voluntarily and contain only reasonable and proportionate obligations. 8. The victim and the offender should normally agree on the basic facts of a case as the basis for their participation in a restorative process. Participation of the offender shall not be used as evidence of admission of guilt in subsequent legal proceedings. 9. Disparities leading to power imbalances, as well as cultural differences among the parties, should be taken into consideration in referring a case to, and in conducting, a restorative process. 10. The safety of the parties shall be considered in referring any case to, and in conducting, a restorative process. 11. Where restorative processes are not suitable or possible, the case should be referred to the criminal justice authorities and a decision should be taken as to how to proceed without delay. In such cases, criminal justice officials should endeavour to encourage the offender to take responsibility vis-a-vis the victim and affected communities, and support the reintegration of the victim and the offender into the community. III. Operation of restorative justice programmes 12. Member States should consider establishing guidelines and standards, with legislative authority when necessary, that govern the use of restorative justice programmes. Such guidelines and standards should respect the basic principles set forth in the present instrument and should address, inter alia: (a) The conditions for the referral of cases to restorative justice programmes; (b) The handling of cases following a restorative process; (c) The qualifications, training and assessment of facilitators; (d) The administration of restorative justice programmes; (e) Standards of competence and rules of conduct governing the operation of restorative justice programmes; E/CN.15/2002/L.2 13. Fundamental procedural safeguards guaranteeing fairness to the offender and the victim should be applied to restorative justice programmes and in particular to restorative processes: (a) Subject to national law, the victim and the offender should have the right to consult with legal counsel concerning the restorative process and, where necessary, to translation and/or interpretation. Minors should, in addition, have the right to the assistance of a parent or guardian; (b) Before agreeing to participate in restorative processes, the parties should be fully informed of their rights, the nature of the process and the possible consequences of their decision; (¢) Neither the victim nor the offender should be coerced, or induced by unfair means, to participate in restorative processes or to accept restorative outcomes. 14. Discussions in restorative processes that are not conducted in public should be confidential, and should not be disclosed subsequently, except with the agreement of the parties or as required by national law. 15. The results of agreements arising out of restorative justice programmes should, where appropriate, be judicially supervised or incorporated into judicial decisions or judgements. Where that occurs, the outcome should have the same status as any other judicial decision or judgement and should preclude prosecution in respect of the same facts. 16. Where no agreement is reached among the parties, the case should be referred back to the established criminal justice process and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Failure to reach an agreement alone shall not be used in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. 17. Failure to implement an agreement made in the course of a restorative process should be referred back to the restorative programme or, where required by national law, to the established criminal justice process and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Failure to implement an agreement, other than a judicial decision or judgement, should not be used as justification for a more severe sentence in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. 18. Facilitators should perform their duties in an impartial manner, with due respect to the dignity of the parties. In that capacity, facilitators should ensure that the parties act with respect towards each other and enable the parties to find a relevant solution among themselves. 19. Facilitators shall possess a good understanding of local cultures and communities and, where appropriate, receive initial training before taking up facilitation duties. IV. Continuing development of restorative justice programmes 20. Member States should consider the formulation of national strategies and policies aimed at the development of restorative justice and at the promotion of a E/CN.15/2002/L.2 culture favourable to the use of restorative justice among law enforcement, judicial and social authorities, as well as local communities. 21. There should be regular consultation between criminal justice authorities and administrators of restorative justice programmes to develop a common understanding and enhance the effectiveness of restorative processes and outcomes, to increase the extent to which restorative programmes are used, and to explore ways in which restorative approaches might be incorporated into criminal justice practices. 22. Member States, in cooperation with civil society where appropriate, should promote research on and evaluation of restorative justice programmes to assess the extent to which they result in restorative outcomes, serve as a complement or alternative to the criminal justice process and provide positive outcomes for all parties. Restorative justice processes may need to undergo change in concrete form over time. Member States should therefore encourage regular evaluation and modification of such programmes. The results of research and evaluation should guide further policy and programme development. V. Saving clause 23.

It has long-term benefits in terms of reducing the costs associated with the formal criminal justice system, as well as other social costs that result from crime. Crime prevention offers opportunities for a more cost-effective and humane approach to the problems of crime. The present Guidelines outline the necessary elements for effective crime prevention in the context of good governance. II. Conceptual frame of reference 2. It is the responsibility of all levels of government to create, maintain and promote a context within which relevant governmental institutions and all segments of civil society, including the corporate sector, can better play their part in preventing crime. 3. For the purposes of the present Guidelines, “crime prevention” comprises strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring, and their potential harmful effects on individuals and society, including fear of crime, by intervening to influence their multiple causes. The enforcement of laws, sentences and corrections, while also performing preventive functions, falls outside the scope of the Guidelines, given the comprehensive coverage of the subject in other United Nations instruments.3 4. The present Guidelines address crime and its effects on victims and society and take into account the growing internationalization of criminal activities. 5. Community involvement and partnerships represent important elements of the concept of crime prevention set out herein. 6. Crime prevention encompasses a wide range of approaches, including those which: (a) Promote the well-being of people and encourage pro-social behaviour through social, economic, health and educational measures, with a particular emphasis on children and youth, and focus on the risk and protective factors associated with crime and victimization (prevention through social development or social crime prevention); (b) Change the conditions in neighbourhoods that influence offending, victimization and the insecurity that results from crime by building on the 3 See Compendium of United Nations Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.92.IV.1 and corrigendum). E/CN.15/2002/L.3 initiatives, expertise and commitment of community members (locally based crime prevention); (c) Prevent the occurrence of crimes by reducing opportunities, increasing risks of being apprehended and minimizing benefits, including through environmental design, and by providing assistance and information to potential and actual victims (situational crime prevention); (d) Prevent recidivism by assisting in the social reintegration of offenders (reintegration programmes). III. Basic principles Government leadership 7. All levels of government should play a leadership role in developing effective and humane crime prevention strategies and in creating and maintaining institutional frameworks for their implementation and review. Socio-economic development and inclusion 8. Crime prevention considerations should be integrated into all relevant social and economic policies and programmes, including those addressing employment, education, health, housing and urban planning, poverty, social marginalization and exclusion. Particular emphasis should be placed on communities, families, children and youth at risk. Partnerships 9. Partnerships are an integral part of effective crime prevention, given the wide- ranging nature of the causes of crime and the skills and responsibilities required to address them. This includes partnerships working across ministries and between authorities, community organizations, non-governmental organizations, the business sector and private citizens. Sustainability/accountability 10. Crime prevention requires adequate resources, including funding for structures and activities, in order to be sustained. There should be clear accountability for funding, implementation and evaluation and for the achievement of planned results. Knowledge base 11. Crime prevention strategies, policies, programmes and actions should be based on a broad, multidisciplinary foundation of knowledge about crime problems, their multiple causes and promising and proven practices. Human rights/rule of law/culture of lawfulness 12. The rule of law and internationally recognized human rights must be respected in all aspects of crime prevention. A culture of lawfulness should be actively promoted in crime prevention. E/CN.15/2002/L.3 Interdependency 13. National crime prevention diagnoses and strategies should, where appropriate, take account of links between local criminal problems and international organized crime. Differentiation 14. Crime prevention strategies should pay due regard to the different needs of men and women and to different cultural identities and minorities. IV. Organization, methods and approaches 15. Recognizing that all States have unique governmental structures, this section sets out tools and methodologies that Governments and all segments of civil society should consider in developing strategies to prevent crime and reduce victimization. It draws on international good practice. Community involvement 16. In some of the areas listed below, Governments bear the primary responsibility. However, the active participation of communities and other segments of civil society is an essential part of effective crime prevention. Communities, in particular, can play an important part in identifying crime prevention priorities, in implementation and evaluation, and in helping identify a sustainable resource base. Organization Government structures 17. Governments should include prevention as a permanent part of their structures and programmes for controlling crime, ensuring that clear responsibilities and goals exist within government for the organization of crime prevention, by, inter alia: (a) Establishing centres or focal points with expertise and resources; (b) Establishing a crime prevention plan with clear priorities and targets; (c) Establishing linkages and coordination between relevant government agencies or departments; (d) Fostering partnerships with non-governmental organizations, the business, private and professional sectors and the community; (e) Seeking the active participation of the public in crime prevention by informing it of the need for and means of action and its role. Training and capacity-building 18. Governments should support the development of crime prevention skills by: (a) Providing professional development for senior officials in relevant agencies; E/CN.15/2002/L.3 (b) Encouraging universities, colleges and other relevant educational agencies to offer basic and advanced courses, including in collaboration with practitioners; (c) Working with the educational and professional sectors to develop certification and professional qualifications; (d) Promoting the capacity of communities to develop and respond to their needs. Supporting partnerships 19. Governments and all segments of civil society should support the principle of partnership, where appropriate, including: (a) Advancing knowledge of the importance of this principle and the components of successful partnerships, including the need for all of the partners to have clear and transparent roles; (b) Fostering their formation at different levels and across sectors; (c) Facilitating their efficient operation. Sustainability 20. Governments and other funding bodies should strive to achieve sustainability of demonstrably effective crime prevention programmes and initiatives through, inter alia: (a) Reviewing resource allocation to establish and maintain an appropriate balance between crime prevention and the criminal justice and other systems, to be more effective in preventing crime and victimization; (b) Establishing clear accountability for funding, programming and coordinating crime prevention initiatives; (c) Encouraging community involvement in sustainability. Methods Knowledge base 21. As appropriate, Governments and/or civil society should facilitate knowledge- based crime prevention by, inter alia: (a) Providing the tools necessary for communities to address crime problems; (b) Supporting the generation of useful and practically applicable knowledge that is scientifically reliable and valid; (¢) Supporting the organization and synthesis of knowledge and identifying and addressing gaps in the knowledge base; (d) Sharing that knowledge, as appropriate, among, inter alia, researchers, policy makers, educators, practitioners from other relevant sectors and the wider community; E/CN.15/2002/L.3 (e) Applying this knowledge in replicating successful interventions, developing new initiatives and anticipating new crime problems and prevention opportunities; (f) Establishing data systems to help manage crime prevention more cost- effectively, including by conducting regular surveys of victimization and offending; (g) Promoting the application of those data in order to reduce repeat victimization, persistent offending and areas with a high level of crime. Planning interventions 22. Those planning interventions should promote a process that includes: (a) A systematic analysis of crime problems, their causes, risk factors and consequences, in particular at the local level; (b) A plan that draws on the most appropriate approach and adapts interventions to the specific local problem and context; (c) An implementation plan to deliver appropriate interventions that are efficient, effective and sustainable; (d) Mobilizing entities that are able to tackle causes; (e) Monitoring and evaluation. Support evaluation 23. Governments, other funding bodies and those involved in programme development and delivery should: (a) Undertake short- and longer-term evaluation to test rigorously what works, where and why; (b) Undertake cost-benefit analyses; (c) Assess the extent to which action results in a reduction in levels of crime and victimization, in the seriousness of crime and in fear of crime; (d) Systematically assess the outcomes and unintended consequences, both positive and negative, of action, such as a decrease in crime rates or the stigmatization of individuals and/or communities. Approaches 24. This section expands upon the social developmental and situational crime prevention approaches. It also outlines approaches that Governments and civil society should endeavour to follow in order to prevent organized crime. E/CN.15/2002/L.3 Social development 25. Governments should address the risk factors of crime and victimization by: (a) Promoting protective factors through comprehensive and non- stigmatizing social and economic development programmes, including health, education, housing and employment; (b) Promoting activities that redress marginalization and exclusion; (c) Promoting positive conflict resolution; (d) Using education and public awareness strategies to foster a culture of lawfulness and tolerance while respecting cultural identities. Situational 26. Governments and civil society, including where appropriate the corporate sector, should support the development of situational crime prevention programmes by, inter alia: (a) Improved environmental design; (b) Appropriate methods of surveillance that are sensitive to the right to privacy; (¢) Encouraging the design of “crime-proof” products; (d) Target “hardening” without impinging upon the quality of the built environment or limiting free access to public space; (e) Implementing strategies to prevent repeat victimization. Prevention of organized crime 27. Governments and civil society should endeavour to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems by, inter alia: (a) Reducing existing and future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in lawful markets with the proceeds of crime, through appropriate legislative, administrative or other measures; (b) Developing measures to prevent the misuse by organized criminal groups of tender procedures conducted by public authorities and of subsidies and licences granted by public authorities for commercial activity; (c) Designing crime prevention strategies, where appropriate, to protect socially marginalized groups, especially women and children, who are vulnerable to the action of organized criminal groups, including trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. E/CN.15/2002/L.3 V. International cooperation Standards and norms 28. In promoting international action in crime prevention, Member States should set out achievable and specific tasks that take into account the main international instruments related to human rights and crime prevention, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (General Assembly resolution 44/25, annex), the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (resolution 48/104), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (The Riyadh Guidelines) (resolution 45/112, annex), the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (resolution 40/34, annex), Guidelines for Cooperation and Technical Assistance in the Field of Urban Crime Prevention (Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/9, annex), as well as the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty- first Century (General Assembly resolution 55/59, annex) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (resolutions 55/25, annexes I-1II, and 55/255, annex). Technical assistance 29. Member States and relevant international funding organizations should provide financial and technical assistance, including capacity-building and training, to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, communities and other relevant organizations for the implementation of effective crime prevention and community safety strategies at the regional, national and local levels. In that context, special attention should be given to research and action on crime prevention through social development. Networking 30. Member States should strengthen or establish international, regional and national crime prevention networks with a view to exchanging best and promising practices, identifying elements of their transferability and making such knowledge available to communities throughout the world. Links between transnational and local crime 31. Member States should collaborate to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems. Prioritizing crime prevention 32. The Centre for International Crime Prevention, the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network of affiliated and associated institutes and other relevant United Nations entities should include in their priorities crime prevention as set out in these Guidelines, set up a coordination mechanism and establish a roster of experts to undertake needs assessment and to provide technical advice. 10 Dissemination 33. Relevant United Nations bodies and other organizations should cooperate to produce crime prevention information in as many languages as possible, using both print and electronic media. 11",03/22/2002,2002_469890,Canada,* E/CN.15/2002/1.,yes

Annex Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime I. Introduction 1. There is clear evidence that well-planned crime prevention strategies not only prevent crime and victimization, but also promote community safety and contribute to the sustainable development of countries. Effective, responsible crime prevention enhances the quality of life of all citizens. It has long-term benefits in terms of reducing the costs associated with the formal criminal justice system, as well as other social costs that result from crime. Crime prevention offers opportunities for a more cost-effective approach to the problems of crime. The present Guidelines outline the necessary elements for effective crime prevention. II. Conceptual frame of reference 2. It is the responsibility of all levels of government to create, maintain and promote a context within which relevant governmental institutions and all segments of civil society, including the corporate sector, can better play their part in preventing crime. 3. For the purposes of the present Guidelines, “crime prevention” comprises strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring, and their potential harmful effects on individuals and society, including fear of crime, by intervening to influence their multiple causes. The enforcement of laws, sentences and corrections, while also performing preventive functions, falls outside the scope of the Guidelines, given the comprehensive coverage of the subject in other United Nations instruments.3 3 See Compendium of United Nations Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.92.1V.1 and corrigendum). E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.2 4. The present Guidelines address crime and its effects on victims and society and take into account the growing internationalization of criminal activities. 5. Community involvement and cooperation/partnerships represent important elements of the concept of crime prevention set out herein. While the term “community” may be defined in different ways, its essence in this context is the involvement of civil society at the local level. 6. Crime prevention encompasses a wide range of approaches, including those which: (a) Promote the well-being of people and encourage pro-social behaviour through social, economic, health and educational measures, with a particular emphasis on children and youth, and focus on the risk and protective factors associated with crime and victimization (prevention through social development or social crime prevention); (b) Change the conditions in neighbourhoods that influence offending, victimization and the insecurity that results from crime by building on the initiatives, expertise and commitment of community members (locally based crime prevention); (c) Prevent the occurrence of crimes by reducing opportunities, increasing risks of being apprehended and minimizing benefits, including through environmental design, and by providing assistance and information to potential and actual victims (situational crime prevention); (d) Prevent recidivism by assisting in the social reintegration of offenders and other preventive mechanisms (reintegration programmes). III. Basic principles Government leadership 7. All levels of government should play a leadership role in developing effective and humane crime prevention strategies and in creating and maintaining institutional frameworks for their implementation and review. Socio-economic development and inclusion 8. Crime prevention considerations should be integrated into all relevant social and economic policies and programmes, including those addressing employment, education, health, housing and urban planning, poverty, social marginalization and exclusion. Particular emphasis should be placed on communities, families, children and youth at risk. Cooperation/partnerships 9. Cooperation/partnerships should be an integral part of effective crime prevention, given the wide-ranging nature of the causes of crime and the skills and responsibilities required to address them. This includes partnerships working across ministries and between authorities, community organizations, non-governmental organizations, the business sector and private citizens. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.2 Sustainability/accountability 10. Crime prevention requires adequate resources, including funding for structures and activities, in order to be sustained. There should be clear accountability for funding, implementation and evaluation and for the achievement of planned results. Knowledge base 11. Crime prevention strategies, policies, programmes and actions should be based on a broad, multidisciplinary foundation of knowledge about crime problems, their multiple causes and promising and proven practices. Human rights/rule of law/culture of lawfulness 12. The rule of law and those human rights which are recognized in international instruments to which Member States are parties must be respected in all aspects of crime prevention. A culture of lawfulness should be actively promoted in crime prevention. Interdependency 13. National crime prevention diagnoses and strategies should, where appropriate, take account of links between local criminal problems and international organized crime. Differentiation 14. Crime prevention strategies should, when appropriate, pay due regard to the different needs of men and women and consider the special needs of vulnerable members of society. IV. Organization, methods and approaches 15. Recognizing that all States have unique governmental structures, this section sets out tools and methodologies that Governments and all segments of civil society should consider in developing strategies to prevent crime and reduce victimization. It draws on international good practice. Community involvement 16. In some of the areas listed below, Governments bear the primary responsibility. However, the active participation of communities and other segments of civil society is an essential part of effective crime prevention. Communities, in particular, should play an important part in identifying crime prevention priorities, in implementation and evaluation, and in helping identify a sustainable resource base. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.2 A. Organization Government structures 17. Governments should include prevention as a permanent part of their structures and programmes for controlling crime, ensuring that clear responsibilities and goals exist within government for the organization of crime prevention, by, inter alia: (a) Establishing centres or focal points with expertise and resources; (b) Establishing a crime prevention plan with clear priorities and targets; (c) Establishing linkages and coordination between relevant government agencies or departments; (d) Fostering partnerships with non-governmental organizations, the business, private and professional sectors and the community; (e) Seeking the active participation of the public in crime prevention by informing it of the need for and means of action and its role. Training and capacity-building 18. Governments should support the development of crime prevention skills by: (a) Providing professional development for senior officials in relevant agencies; (b) Encouraging universities, colleges and other relevant educational agencies to offer basic and advanced courses, including in collaboration with practitioners; (¢) Working with the educational and professional sectors to develop certification and professional qualifications; (d) Promoting the capacity of communities to develop and respond to their needs. Supporting partnerships 19. Governments and all segments of civil society should support the principle of partnership, where appropriate, including: (a) Advancing knowledge of the importance of this principle and the components of successful partnerships, including the need for all of the partners to have clear and transparent roles; (b) Fostering their formation at different levels and across sectors; (c¢) Facilitating their efficient operation. Sustainability 20. Governments and other funding bodies should strive to achieve sustainability of demonstrably effective crime prevention programmes and initiatives through, inter alia: E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.2 (a) Reviewing resource allocation to establish and maintain an appropriate balance between crime prevention and the criminal justice and other systems, to be more effective in preventing crime and victimization; (b) Establishing clear accountability for funding, programming and coordinating crime prevention initiatives; (¢) Encouraging community involvement in sustainability. B. Methods Knowledge base 21. As appropriate, Governments and/or civil society should facilitate knowledge- based crime prevention by, inter alia: (a) Providing the information necessary for communities to address crime problems; (b) Supporting the generation of useful and practically applicable knowledge that is scientifically reliable and valid; (c) Supporting the organization and synthesis of knowledge and identifying and addressing gaps in the knowledge base; (d) Sharing that knowledge, as appropriate, among, inter alia, researchers, policy makers, educators, practitioners from other relevant sectors and the wider community; (e) Applying this knowledge in replicating successful interventions, developing new initiatives and anticipating new crime problems and prevention opportunities; (f) Establishing data systems to help manage crime prevention more cost- effectively, including by conducting regular surveys of victimization and offending; (g) Promoting the application of those data in order to reduce repeat victimization, persistent offending and areas with a high level of crime. Planning interventions 22. Those planning interventions should promote a process that includes: (a) A systematic analysis of crime problems, their causes, risk factors and consequences, in particular at the local level; (b) A plan that draws on the most appropriate approach and adapts interventions to the specific local problem and context; (c) An implementation plan to deliver appropriate interventions that are efficient, effective and sustainable; (d) Mobilizing entities that are able to tackle causes; (e) Monitoring and evaluation. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.2 Support evaluation 23. Governments, other funding bodies and those involved in programme development and delivery should: (a) Undertake short- and longer-term evaluation to test rigorously what works, where and why; (b) Undertake cost-benefit analyses; (c) Assess the extent to which action results in a reduction in levels of crime and victimization, in the seriousness of crime and in fear of crime; (d) Systematically assess the outcomes and unintended consequences, both positive and negative, of action, such as a decrease in crime rates or the stigmatization of individuals and/or communities. C. Approaches 24. This section expands upon the social developmental and situational crime prevention approaches. It also outlines approaches that Governments and civil society should endeavour to follow in order to prevent organized crime. Social development 25. Governments should address the risk factors of crime and victimization by: (a) Promoting protective factors through comprehensive and non- stigmatizing social and economic development programmes, including health, education, housing and employment; (b) Promoting activities that redress marginalization and exclusion; (c) Promoting positive conflict resolution; (d) Using education and public awareness strategies to foster a culture of lawfulness and tolerance while respecting cultural identities. Situational 26. Governments and civil society, including where appropriate the corporate sector, should support the development of situational crime prevention programmes by, inter alia: (a) Improved environmental design; (b) Appropriate methods of surveillance that are sensitive to the right to privacy; (c) Encouraging the design of consumer goods to make them more resistant to crime; (d) Target “hardening” without impinging upon the quality of the built environment or limiting free access to public space; (e) Implementing strategies to prevent repeat victimization. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.2 Prevention of organized crime 27. Governments and civil society should endeavour to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems by, inter alia: (a) Reducing existing and future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in lawful markets with the proceeds of crime, through appropriate legislative, administrative or other measures; (b) Developing measures to prevent the misuse by organized criminal groups of tender procedures conducted by public authorities and of subsidies and licences granted by public authorities for commercial activity; (c) Designing crime prevention strategies, where appropriate, to protect socially marginalized groups, especially women and children, who are vulnerable to the action of organized criminal groups, including trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. V. International cooperation Standards and norms 28. In promoting international action in crime prevention, Member States are invited to set out achievable and specific tasks that take into account the main international instruments related to human rights and crime prevention to which they are parties, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (General Assembly resolution 44/25, annex), the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (resolution 48/104), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines) (resolution 45/112, annex), the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (resolution 40/34, annex), the Guidelines for Cooperation and Technical Assistance in the Field of Urban Crime Prevention (Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/9, annex), as well as the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century (General Assembly resolution 55/59, annex) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (resolutions 55/25, annexes I-III, and 55/255, annex). Technical assistance 29. Member States and relevant international funding organizations should provide financial and technical assistance, including capacity-building and training, to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, communities and other relevant organizations for the implementation of effective crime prevention and community safety strategies at the regional, national and local levels. In that context, special attention should be given to research and action on crime prevention through social development. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.2 Networking 30. Member States should strengthen or establish international, regional and national crime prevention networks with a view to exchanging proven and promising practices, identifying elements of their transferability and making such knowledge available to communities throughout the world. Links between transnational and local crime 31. Member States should collaborate to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems. Prioritizing crime prevention 32. The Centre for International Crime Prevention, the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network of affiliated and associated institutes and other relevant United Nations entities should include in their priorities crime prevention as set out in these Guidelines, set up a coordination mechanism and establish a roster of experts to undertake needs assessment and to provide technical advice. Dissemination 33. Relevant United Nations bodies and other organizations should cooperate to produce crime prevention information in as many languages as possible, using both print and electronic media. 10",04/24/2002,2002_469946,Canada,N/A,yes

Annex GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION OF NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS BY PARTIES INCLUDED IN ANNEX I TO THE CONVENTION, PART I: UNFCCC REPORTING GUIDELINES ON ANNUAL INVENTORIES A. Objectives The objectives of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories are: (a) To assist Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties)' in meeting their commitments under Articles 4 and 12 of the Convention and to assist Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in preparing to meet commitments under Articles 3, 5 and 7 of the Kyoto Protocol; (b) To facilitate the process of considering annual national inventories, including the preparation of technical analysis and synthesis documentation; (c) To facilitate the process of verification, technical assessment and expert review of the inventory information. B. Principles and definitions 2. National greenhouse gas inventories, referred to below only as inventories, should be transparent, consistent, comparable, complete and accurate. 3. Inventories should be prepared using comparable methodologies agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties (COP), as indicated in paragraph 9 below. In the context of these UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories: Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the process for the communication and consideration of information; Consistency means that an inventory should be internally consistent in all its elements with inventories of other years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks. Under certain circumstances referred to in paragraphs 15 and 16, an inventory using different methodologies for different years can be considered to be consistent if it has been recalculated in a transparent manner, in accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories;” Comparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by Parties in inventories should be comparable among Parties. For this purpose, Parties should use the methodologies and formats agreed by the COP for estimating and reporting inventories. The allocation of different source/sink ' Parties included in Annex I to the Convention are referred to as “Parties” in these guidelines. Referred to in this document as the “IPCC good practice guidance”. The IPCC is currently developing “Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry”. categories should follow the split of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,” at the level of its summary and sectoral tables; Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks, as well as all gases, included in the IPCC Guidelines as well as other existing relevant source/sink categories which are specific to individual Parties and, therefore, may not be included in the [IPCC Guidelines. Completeness also means full geographic coverage of sources and sinks of a Party;* and Accuracy is a relative measure of the exactness of an emission or removal estimate. Estimates should be accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over nor under true emissions or removals, as far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Appropriate methodologies should be used, in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance, to promote accuracy in inventories. 5. In the context of these guidelines, definitions of common terms used in greenhouse gas inventory preparation are those provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. C. Context 6. These UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories cover the estimation and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals in both annual inventories and inventories included in national communications, as specified by decision 11/CP.4 and other relevant decisions of the COP. 7. An annual inventory submission shall consist of a national inventory report (NIR) and the common report format (CRF) tables, as described in paragraphs 38 through 43 and 44 through 50, respectively. D. Base year 8. The year 1990 should be the base year for the estimation and reporting of inventories. According to the provisions of Article 4.6 of the Convention and decisions 9/CP.2 and 11/CP.4, the following Annex I Parties that are undergoing the process of transition to a market economy are allowed to use a base year or a period of years other than 1990, as follows: Bulgaria: Hungary: Poland: Romania: Slovenia: 1988 the average of the years 1985 to 1987 1988 1989 1986 E. Methods Methodology 9. Parties shall use the IPCC Guidelines to estimate and report on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. In preparing national inventories of these gases. Parties shall also use the IPCC good practice guidance in order to improve transparency, consistency, comparability, completeness and accuracy. Referred to in this document as the “IPCC Guidelines”. According to the instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to the Convention of each Party. 10. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines, Parties may use different methods (tiers) included in those guidelines, giving priority to those methods which, according to the decision trees in the [PCC good practice guidance, produce more accurate estimates. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines, Parties may also use national methodologies which they consider better able to reflect their national situation, provided that these methodologies are compatible with the IPCC Guidelines and IPCC good practice guidance and are well documented and scientifically based. 11. For source categories that are determined to be key source categories, in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance and estimated in accordance with the provisions in paragraph 13 below, Parties should make every effort to use a recommended method, in accordance with the corresponding decision trees of the IPCC good practice guidance. Parties should also make every effort to develop and/or select emission factors, and collect and select activity data in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance. 12. For most source categories, the [IPCC Guidelines provide a default methodology which includes default emission factors, and in some cases default activity data references. Furthermore, the IPCC good practice guidance provides updated default emission factors and default activity data for some sources and gases. As the assumptions implicit in these default data, factors and methods may not be appropriate for specific national contexts, it is preferable for Parties to use their own national emission factors and activity data, where available, provided that they are developed in a manner consistent with the [PCC good practice guidance, are considered to be more accurate, and reported transparently. The updated default activity data or emission factors provided in the [IPCC good practice guidance should be used, where available, if Parties choose to use default factors or data due to lack of country-specific information. Key source category determination 13. Parties shall identify their national key source categories for the base year and the latest reported inventory year, as described in the IPCC good practice guidance, using the tier 1 or tier 2 level and trend assessment. Uncertainties 14. Parties shall quantitatively estimate the uncertainties in the data used for all source and sink categories using at least the tier 1 method, as provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. Alternatively, Parties may also use the tier 2 method in the good practice guidance to address technical limitations in the tier 1 method. Uncertainty in the data used for all source and sink categories should also be qualitatively discussed in a transparent manner in the NIR, in particular for those sources that were identified as key sources. Recalculations 15. The inventories of an entire time series, including the base year and all subsequent years for which inventories have been reported, should be estimated using the same methodologies, and the underlying activity data and emission factors should be obtained and used in a consistent manner. Recalculations should ensure consistency of the time series and shall be carried out only to improve accuracy and/or completeness. Where the methodology or manner in which underlying activity data and emission factors are gathered has changed, Parties should recalculate inventories for the base and subsequent years. Parties should evaluate the need for recalculations relative to the reasons provided by the IPCC good practice guidance, in particular for key sources. Recalculations should be performed in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance and the general principles set down in these guidelines. 16. In some cases it may not be possible to use the same methods and consistent data sets for all years due to a possible lack of activity data, emission factors or other parameters directly used in the calculation of emission estimates for some historical years, including the base year. In such cases, emissions or removals may need to be recalculated using alternative methods not generally covered by paragraphs 9 through 12. In these instances, Parties should use one of the techniques provided by the IPCC good practice guidance (e.g., overlap, surrogate, interpolation, and extrapolation) to determine the missing values. Parties should document and demonstrate in the NIR that the time series is consistent, wherever such techniques are used. Quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) 17. Each Party shall elaborate an inventory QA/QC plan and implement general inventory QC procedures (tier 1)’ in accordance with its QA/QC plan following the IPCC good practice guidance. In addition, Parties should apply source category specific QC procedures (tier 2) for key source categories and for those individual source categories in which significant methodological changes and/or data revisions have occurred, in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance. The implementation of tier 2 QC may be more efficiently implemented in conjunction with the evaluation of uncertainties in data sources. In addition, Parties should implement QA procedures by conducting a basic expert peer review (tier 1 QA) of their inventories in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance. F. Reporting 1. General guidance Estimates of emissions and removals 18. Article 12.1 (a) of the Convention requires that each Party shall communicate to the COP, through the secretariat, inter alia, a national inventory of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. As a minimum requirement, inventories shall contain information on the following greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO,), methane (CHy,), nitrous oxide (N,O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF). Parties should report anthropogenic emissions and removals of any other greenhouse gases whose 100-year global warming potential (GWP) values have been identified by the IPCC and adopted by the COP. Parties should also provide information on the following indirect greenhouse gases: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), as well as sulphur oxides (SOy). 19. Greenhouse gas emissions and removals should be presented on a gas-by-gas basis in units of mass with emissions by sources listed separately from removals by sinks, except in cases where it may be technically impossible to separate information on sources and sinks in the areas of land use, land-use change and forestry. For HFCs and PFCs, emissions should be reported for each relevant chemical in the category on a disaggregated basis except in cases where paragraph 27 applies. 20. In addition, consistent with decision 2/CP.3, Parties should report aggregate emissions and removals of greenhouse gases, expressed in CO, equivalent terms at summary inventory level’, using GWP values provided by the IPCC in its Second Assessment Report, referred to below as 1995 IPCC > As outlined in table 8.1 of the IPCC good practice guidance. CO, equivalent emissions should be provided at a level of category disaggregation similar to that specified in table Summary 1.A of the common reporting format. GWP values, based on the effects of greenhouse gases over a 100-year time horizon. A list of these values is given in table 1 at the end of this document. Table 1 will be amended to include any additional greenhouse gases and their 100-year GWP values, once the GWP values have been adopted by the COP. 21. Consistent with decision 2/CP.3, Parties should report actual emissions of HFCs, PFCs and SF, where data are available, providing disaggregated data by chemical (for example, HFC-134a) and source category in units of mass and in CO; equivalents. Parties should make every effort to develop the necessary sources of data for reporting actual emissions. For the source categories where the concept of potential emissions applies, and Parties do not yet have the necessary data to calculate actual emissions, Parties should report disaggregated potential emissions. Parties reporting actual emissions should also report potential emissions for the sources where the concept of potential emissions applies, for reasons of transparency and comparability. 22. Any Annex I Party that is a Party to the Kyoto Protocol and that in accordance with Article 3, paragraph 8 of the Kyoto Protocol chooses to use 1995 as its base year for HFCs, PFCs and SF; for the purposes of calculating assigned amounts pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol, should indicate this in its NIR and in the documentation boxes of the relevant tables of the CREF. Irrespective of the base year chosen for these gases for the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol, such Parties should report, to the extent that data are available, emission estimates and trends for these gases from 1990 onward, in accordance with the provisions of these guidelines. 23. Parties are strongly encouraged to also report emissions and removals of additional greenhouse gases for which 100-year GWP values are available, but not yet adopted by the COP. These emissions and removals should be reported separately from national totals. The GWP value and reference should be indicated. 24, In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines, international aviation and marine bunker fuel emissions should not be included in national totals but should be reported separately. Parties should make every effort to both apply and report according to the IPCC good practice guidance method for separation between domestic and international emissions. Parties should also report emissions from international aviation and marine bunker fuels as two separate entries in their inventories. 25. Parties should clearly indicate how feedstocks and non-energy use of fuels have been accounted for in the inventory, in the energy or industrial processes sector, in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance. 26. If Parties account for effects of CO, capture from flue gases and subsequent CO, storage in their inventory, they should indicate in which source categories such effects are included, and provide transparent documentation of the methodologies used and the resulting effects. 27. Emissions and removals should be reported at the most disaggregated level of each source/sink category, taking into account that a minimum level of aggregation may be required to protect confidential business and military information. Completeness 28. Where methodological or data gaps in inventories exist, information on these gaps should be presented in a transparent manner. Parties should clearly indicate the sources and sinks not considered in their inventories but which are included in the IPCC Guidelines, and explain the reasons for such exclusion. Similarly, Parties should indicate the parts of their geographical area, if any, not covered by their inventory and explain the reasons for their exclusion. In addition, Parties should use the notation keys presented below to fill in the blanks in all the tables in the CRF’. This approach facilitates assessment of the completeness of an inventory. The notation keys are as follows: (a) “NO” (not occurring) for activities or processes in a particular source or sink category that do not occur within a country; (b) “NE” (not estimated) for existing emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which have not been estimated. Where “NE” is used in an inventory for emissions or removals of CO,, N,O, CH,, HFCs, PFCs, or SFg, the Party should indicate in both the NIR and the CRF completeness table why emissions or removals have not been estimated; ® (c) “NA” (not applicable) for activities in a given source/sink category that do not result in emissions or removals of a specific gas. If categories in the CRF for which “NA” is applicable are shaded, they do not need to be filled in; (d) “IE” (included elsewhere) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases estimated but included elsewhere in the inventory instead of the expected source/sink category. Where “IE” is used in an inventory, the Party should indicate, using the CRF completeness table, where in the inventory the emissions or removals from the displaced source/sink category have been included and the Party should explain such a deviation from the expected category; (e) “C” (confidential) for emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, given the provisions of paragraph 27 above. 29. If Parties estimate and report emissions and removals from country-specific sources or sinks or of gases which are not part of the IPCC Guidelines, they should explicitly describe what source/sink categories or gases these are, as well as what methodologies, emission factors and activity data have been used for their estimation and provide the references for these data. Key sources 30. Parties shall estimate and report the individual and cumulative percentage contributions of emissions from key source categories to their national total, with respect to both emission level and emission trend. The emissions should be expressed in terms of CO; equivalents using the methods provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. As indicated in paragraphs 41 and 47, this information should be included in table 7 of the CRF as well as the NIR using tables 7.A1 — 7.A3 of the [IPCC good practice guidance adapted to the level of category disaggregation that the Party used for determining its key sources. Verification 31. In accordance with the IPCC Guidelines, as well as for verification purposes, Parties should compare their national estimates of carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion with those estimates obtained using the IPCC reference approach, and report the results of this comparison in the CRF and NIR. Parties are also encouraged to report on any peer review of their inventory conducted nationally. If notation keys are used in the NIR they should be consistent with those reported in the CRF. Even if emission estimates are considered to be negligible, Parties should either report the emission estimate if calculated or use the notation key “NE”. Uncertainties 32. Parties shall report, in the NIR, uncertainties estimated as indicated in paragraph 14 above, as well as methods used and underlying assumptions, with the purpose of helping prioritize efforts to improve the accuracy of national inventories in the future and guide decisions on methodological choice. This information should be presented using tables 6.1 and 6.2 of the IPCC good practice guidance. In addition, Parties should indicate in these tables those sources that have been identified as key sources in their inventory. If the methods used to estimate the level of uncertainty depart from the IPCC good practice guidance, these methods should be described. Recalculations 33. Recalculations of previously submitted estimates of emissions and removals as a result of changes in methodologies, changes in the manner in which emission factors and activity data are obtained and used or the inclusion of new sources or sinks which have existed since the base year but were not previously reported, should be reported for the base year and all subsequent years up to the year in which the recalculations are made. 34. Recalculations should be reported in the NIR, with explanatory information including justification for recalculations, and in the relevant CRF tables. Parties should also provide explanations for those cases in which they have not recalculated an estimate when such a recalculation is called for in the IPCC good practice guidance. Information on the procedures used for performing the recalculations, changes in the calculation methods, emission factors and activity data used and the inclusion of sources or sinks not previously covered, should be reported with an indication of the relevant changes in each source or sink category where these changes have taken place. For key sources, Parties should include this information in the NIR, as indicated in paragraph 41 below. 35. Parties should report any other changes in estimates of emissions and removals, regardless of magnitude, and clearly indicate the reason for the changes compared with previously submitted inventories, e.g., error correction, statistical or editorial changes or reallocation of sources, using the corresponding CREF table, as indicated in paragraph 47 and outlined in the annex to these guidelines. 36. Parties shall report in the NIR on their QA/QC plan and give information on QA/QC procedures already implemented or to be implemented in the future. Adj ustments’ 37. Inventories are to be reported without adjustments related, for example, to climate variations or trade patterns of electricity. If Parties, in addition, carry out such adjustments to inventory data, they should be reported separately and in a transparent manner, with clear indications of the method followed. 2. National inventory report 38. Parties shall submit to the COP, through the secretariat, an NIR containing detailed and complete information on their inventories. The NIR should ensure transparency and contain sufficiently detailed ? The adjustments referred to here relate, for example, to climate variations or trade patterns of electricity. They do not refer to adjustments under Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol. information to enable the inventory to be reviewed. This information should cover the entire time series, from the base year'” to the latest inventory year, and any changes to previously submitted inventories. 39. Each year, an updated NIR shall be electronically submitted in its entirety to the COP, through the secretariat, in accordance with the relevant decisions of the COP; in instances where Parties have produced published hard copy versions of their NIR, they are also encouraged to submit copies to the secretariat. 40. The NIR shall include annual inventory information, submitted in accordance with paragraph 38 above. The NIR should include: 41. (a) Descriptions, references and sources of information of the specific methodologies, assumptions, emission factors and activity data, as well as the rationale for their selection. It also should include an indication of the level of complexity (IPCC tiers) applied and a description of any national methodology used by the Party, as well as information on anticipated future improvements. For key sources, an explanation should be provided if the recommended methods from the appropriate decision tree in the IPCC good practice guidance are not used.

Key findings on the quality of the input data, methods, processing and archiving and how they have been addressed, should be described; A description of the institutional arrangements for inventory preparation. W) 42. If any of the information required under subparagraphs (a) to (h) above is provided in detail in the CRF, Parties should indicate in the NIR where in the CRF this information is provided. 43. The NIR should be reported in accordance with the outline contained in the appendix to these guidelines, ensuring that all information requested in paragraph 41 above is included. 3. Common reporting format 44. The common reporting format is designed to ensure that Parties report quantitative data in a standardized format and to facilitate comparison of inventory data and trends among Parties. Explanation of information of a qualitative character should mainly be provided in the NIR rather than in the CREF tables. Such explanatory information should be cross-referenced to the specific section of the NIR. 45. Parties shall submit annually to the COP, through the secretariat, the information required in the CREF as contained in the annex to these guidelines. This information shall be electronically submitted on an annual basis in its entirety to the COP, through the secretariat, in accordance with the relevant decisions of the COP. 46. The CREF is a standardized format for reporting estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and removals and other relevant information. The CRF allows for the improved handling of electronic 2"" The SBSTA may wish to consider this issue when guidance on good practice for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector has been completed by the IPCC and, as appropriate, expand this subparagraph in any subsequent revisions of these guidelines. submissions and facilitates the processing of inventory information and the preparation of useful technical analysis and synthesis documentation. The CRF consists of: 47. Summary, sectoral and trend tables for all greenhouse gas emissions and removals; (a) (b) Sectoral background data tables for reporting implied emission factors' and activity data, including: IPCC worksheet 1-1 containing estimates of CO, emissions from fuel combustion using the IPCC reference approach and a table for comparing estimates under this reference approach with estimates under the sectoral approach, as well as providing explanations of any significant differences;""* (i) Tables for reporting fossil fuel consumption for non-energy feedstocks, international bunkers and multilateral operations; (i) (c) Tables for reporting, inter alia, key source categories, recalculations and completeness of the inventory. 48. The CRF should be reported in accordance with the tables included in the annex to these guidelines, ensuring that all information requested in paragraph 47 above is included. In completing these tables Parties should: (a) Provide the full CRF for the latest inventory year and for those years for which any change in any sector has been made. For years where no changes are made, resubmission of full CRF tables is not necessary, but a reference should be made to the inventory submission in which the unchanged data were reported originally. Parties should ensure that a full and time-series consistent set of CREF tables is annually available for the entire time series from the base year onwards; (b) Provide the CRF trend tables covering inventory years for the entire time series in one submission only, that is, in the CRF for the last inventory year; (c) Provide completeness tables in one submission only if the information applies to all years. If the information in these tables differs for each reported year, then either the tables or information on the specific changes must be provided for each year in the CRF; (d) Use the documentation boxes provided at the foot of the sectoral report and background data tables to provide cross-references to detailed explanations in the NIR, or any other information, as specified in those boxes. 49. Parties should provide the information requested in the additional information boxes. Where the information called for is inappropriate because of the methodological tier used by the Party, the corresponding cells should be completed using the notation key “NA”. In such cases, the Parties should cross-reference in the documentation box the relevant section in the NIR where equivalent information can be found. > The sectoral background tables were designed to allow calculation of implied emission factors. These are top- down ratios between a Party's emission estimates and activity data at the level of aggregation given by the tables. The implied emission factors are intended solely for purposes of data comparison. They will not necessarily be the emission factors actually used in the original emission estimate, unless this was a simple multiplication based on the same aggregate activity data used to calculate the implied emission factor. "" Detailed explanations should be included in the NIR. 50. Parties should use the notation keys, as specified in paragraph 28 above, in all tables of the CRF, to fill in the cells where no quantitative data are directly entered. Using the notation keys in this way facilitates the assessment of the completeness of an inventory. Specific guidance is provided on how notation keys should be used in each CRF table where qualitative information is required. G. Record keeping 51. Parties should gather and archive all relevant inventory information for each year, including all disaggregated emission factors, activity data and documentation on how these factors and data were generated, including expert judgement where appropriate, and how they have been aggregated for reporting in the inventory. This information should allow reconstruction of the inventory by the expert review teams, inter alia. Inventory information should be archived from the base year and should include corresponding data on the recalculations applied. The “paper trail”, which can include spreadsheets or databases used to compile inventory data, should enable estimates of emissions and removals to be traced back to the original disaggregated emission factors and activity data. Also, relevant supporting documentation related to QA/QC implementation, uncertainty evaluation, or key source analyses should be kept on file. This information should also facilitate the process of clarifying inventory data in a timely manner when the secretariat prepares annual compilations of inventories or assesses methodological issues. Parties are encouraged to collect and gather the information in a single national inventory facility or, at least, to keep the number of facilities to a minimum. H. Systematic updating of the guidelines 52. These UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories shall be reviewed and revised, as appropriate, in accordance with decisions of the COP on this matter. I. Language 53. The national inventory report shall be submitted in one of the official languages of the United Nations. Parties are also encouraged to submit, where relevant, a translation of the national inventory report into English.

Chapters 3-9: (e.g. SECTOR NAME (CRF sector No)) The structure outlined below should be followed in each of the following sectoral chapters. The information should be reported following the IPCC sectors. Overview of sector (e.g., quantitative overview and description) Source category (CRF source category No) 3.1. 3.2 For each IPCC source category (i.e., at the level of the table Summary 1.4 of the CRF, or the level at which IPCC methods are described, or at the level that the Party estimates its greenhouse gas emissions) the following information should be provided: 3.2.1. Source category description (e.g., characteristics of sources) 3.2.2.

For key source categories, the information should be detailed in order to enable a thorough review of the inventory. Chapter 3: ENERGY (CREF sector 1) In addition, the energy information should include the following: Fuel combustion (CRF 1.A), including detailed information on: Comparison of the sectoral approach with the reference approach International bunker fuels Feedstocks and non-energy use of fuels CO, capture from flue gases and subsequent CO, storage Country-specific issues Fugitive emissions from solid fuels and oil and natural gas (CRF 1.B) Chapter 4: INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES (CREF sector 2) Chapter 5: SOLVENT AND OTHER PRODUCT USE (CREF sector 3) Chapter 6: AGRICULTURE (CRF sector 4) Chapter 7: LUCF (CREF sector 5) Chapter 8: WASTE (CREF sector 6) Chapter 9: OTHER (CRF sector 7) (if applicable) In addition, information previously included in the additional information and the documentation boxes of the CRF version for the trial period, should be included and expanded in the NIR, where relevant, as specified in the appendix to this proposed structure. Chapter 10: RECALCULATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS Information should be provided in this chapter that provides an overview of recalculations and improvements made to the inventory, however, it is not necessary to repeat information that is provided in the sector chapters, specifically the source specific information to be provided, and in particular, Parties should cross-reference information provided in the sector chapters. 10.1.

This list is not exhaustive. Additional information may be included in the NIR, depending on the Party’s national approach for estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Energy Fuel combustion More specific information than that required in CRF table 1.A(a) could be provided, e.g., e autoproduction of electricity; e urban heating (in manufacturing industries, commercial and residential sectors). Fugitive fuel emissions Coal mining: More specific information than that required in CRF table 1.B.1 could be provided, e.g. e number of active underground mines; e number of mines with drainage (recovery) systems. Oil and natural gas: More specific information than that required in CRF table 1.B.2 could be provided, e.g. e pipeline length number of oil wells number of gas wells gas throughput'’ oil throughput'’ Industrial processes Metal production More specific information than is required in CRF table 2(I).A-G could be provided, e.g., e data on virgin and recycled steel production. ' Most of the requirements included in this list were previously reported in the additional information boxes of the CREF tables. As the information is not used directly for the estimation of emissions, participants at the expert meeting recommended that they should be reported in the NIR instead. Some requirements included in this list were not previously covered in the CRF; they emerged as a result of the expert meeting and comments provided by Parties. 7"" In the context of oil and gas production, throughput is a measure of the total production, such as barrels per day of oil, or cubic metres of gas per year. Specify the units of the reported values. Take into account that these values should be consistent with the activity data reported under production in table 1.B.2 of the CRF. Potential emissions of halocarbons and SF¢ e In CRF table 2(Il)s2, reporting of “production” refers to production of new chemicals. Recycled substances could be included in that table, but it should be ensured that double counting of emissions is avoided. Relevant explanations should be provided in the NIR. PFCs and SF, from metal production / Production of halocarbons and SF¢ The type of activity data used is to be specified in CRF tables 2(II).C-E (under column “description”). Where applying tier 1b (for 2.C Metal production), tier 2 (for 2.E Production of halocarbons and SF¢) and country-specific methods, any other relevant activity data used should be specified. Consumption of HFCs, PFCs and SF, With regard to activity data reported in CRF table 2(II).F (“Amount of fluid remaining in products at decommissioning”), Parties should provide in the NIR information on the amount of the chemical recovered (recovery efficiency) and other relevant information used in the emission estimation. CREF table 2.(I).F provides for reporting of the activity data and emission factors used to calculate actual emissions from consumption of halocarbons and SF¢ using the ""bottom-up approach"" (based on the total stock of equipment and estimated emission rates from this equipment). Some Parties may prefer to estimate their actual emissions following the alternative ""top-down approach"" (based on annual sales of equipment and/or gas). Those Parties should provide the activity data used in that CRF table and provide any other relevant information in the NIR. Data these Parties should provide include: the amount of fluid used to fill new products, the amount of fluid used to service existing products, the amount of fluid originally used to fill retiring products (the total nameplate capacity of retiring products), the product lifetime, the growth rate of product sales, if this has been used to calculate the amount of fluid originally used to fill retiring products. Alternatively, Parties may provide alternative formats with equivalent information. Solvents and other product use e The IPCC Guidelines do not provide methodologies for the calculation of emissions of N,O from solvent and other product use. If reporting such data in the CRF, Parties should provide additional information (activity data and emission factors) used to make these estimates in the NIR. Agriculture Cross-cutting Parties should provide livestock population data in CRF table 4.A. Any further disaggregation of these data, e.g. for regions, for type (according to the classification recommended in the IPCC good practice guidance) could be provided in the NIR, where relevant. Consistent livestock population data should be used in the relevant CRF tables to estimate CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation, CH4 and N,O emissions from manure management, N,O emissions from soils, and N,O emissions associated with manure production and use, as well as emissions from the use of manure as fuel and sewage-related emissions reported in the waste sector. Enteric fermentation More specific information than is required in CRF table 4.A could be provided, e.g., e Parameters relevant to the application of good practice guidance. Manure management More specific information than is required in CRF tables 4.B(a) and 4.B(b) could be provided, e.g., e Parameters relevant to the application of good practice guidance; e Information required in the additional information table may not be directly applicable to country- specific methods developed for methane conversion factor (MCF) calculations. If relevant data can not be provided in the additional information box, information on how the MCF are derived should be described in the NIR. Rice cultivation More specific information than is required in CRF table 4.C could be provided, e.g., e When disaggregating by more than one region within a country and/or by growing season, provide additional information on disaggregation and related data in the NIR. Where available, provide activity data and scaling factors by soil type and rice cultivar in the NIR. Agricultural soils More specific information than is required in CRF table 4.D could be provided, e.g., The IPCC Guidelines do not provide methodologies for the calculation of CH, emissions or removals by agricultural soils. If reporting such data, Parties should provide in the NIR additional information (activity data and emission factors) used to make these estimates; Parties which choose to account for CO, emissions and removals from agricultural soils under the agriculture sector (4.D Agricultural soils) should report background information on CO, emissions and removals estimates from agricultural soils (activity data, emissions factors) in the NIR; In addition to the data required in the additional information box of table 4.D, disaggregated values for Fracgraz according to animal type, and for Fracgyry according to crop types, should be provided in the NIR. Prescribed burning of savannas and field burning of agricultural residues More specific information than is required in CRF tables 4.E and 4.F could be provided, e.g., e The IPCC Guidelines do not provide methodologies for the calculation of CO, emissions from savanna burning or agricultural residues burning. If reporting such data, Parties should provide in the NIR additional information (activity data and emission factors) used to make these estimates. Waste Solid waste disposal and waste incineration More specific information than is required in CRF tables 6.A and 6.C could be provided, e.g., e All relevant information used in the calculation should be provided in the NIR, if it not already included in the additional information box of the CRF. e Composition of landfilled waste (%), according to paper and paperboard, food and garden waste, plastics, glass, textiles, other (specify according to inert or organic waste, respectively) Fraction of wastes recycled e Fraction of wastes incinerated e Number of solid waste disposal sites recovering CH, Waste-water handling More specific information than is required in CRF table 6.B could be provided, e.g., e With regard to data on N,O from waste-water handling to be reported in CRF table 6.B, Parties using other methods for estimation of N,O emissions from human sewage or waste-water treatment should provide in the NIR corresponding information on methods, activity data and emission factors used. CRF TABLES™ Notes on the common reporting format 1. The common reporting format (CRF) is an integral part of the national inventory submission. It is designed to ensure that Parties report quantitative data in a standardized format, and to facilitate the comparison of inventory data across Parties. Details regarding any information of a non-quantitative character should be provided in the NIR. 2. The information provided in the CRF is aimed at enhancing the comparability and transparency of inventories by facilitating, inter alia, activity data and implied emission factor (IEF) cross-comparisons among Parties, and easy identification of possible mistakes, misunderstandings and omissions in the inventories. 3. As stated in these reporting guidelines, the CRF consists of summary report and sectoral report tables from the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines) plus newly developed sectoral background data tables and other tables that are consistent with the IPCC Guidelines and the IPCC good practice guidance. 4. Some sectoral background tables call for the calculation of IEFs. These are top-down ratios between the Party’s emissions estimate and aggregate activity data. The IEF are intended solely for purposes of comparison. They will not necessarily be the emission factors actually used in the original emissions estimate, unless of course this was a simple multiplication based on the same aggregate activity data used to calculate the implied emission factor. 5. Consistent with the IPCC Guidelines, memo items, such as emissions estimates from international marine and aviation bunker fuels, CO, emissions from biomass and emissions from multilateral operations, should be reported in the appropriate tables, but not included in the national totals. 6. Parties should use the documentation boxes at the foot of the tables to provide specific references to the relevant sections of the NIR where full details for a given sector/source category are to be provided. 7. Parties should fill in all the cells calling for emissions or removals estimates, activity data, or emission factors. Notation keys, as described in paragraph 28 of the reporting guidelines, should be used where data have not been entered. 8. In the sectoral background tables, below the source category “Other”, an empty row indicates that country-specific source categories may be added. These source categories will automatically be included in the sectoral report tables. 9. Parties should complete the data in the additional information boxes. Where the information called for is inappropriate because of the methodological tier used by the Party, the corresponding cells should be completed using the indicator “NA”. 10. Table 5 (the land-use change and forestry sectoral report) should be completed by Parties. The corresponding sectoral background tables 5.A-D follow the IPCC Guidelines and should be completed by '8 When the guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories are adopted by the COP and issued as a final document, this part will constitute the annex to these guidelines. Parties that use IPCC default methods. Parties not using the IPCC default methods are encouraged to provide background data and descriptions for the methodologies used to estimate emissions/removals from the LUCF sector in the NIR in order to enhance transparency. Alternative formats for tables 5.A-D will be considered after the IPCC has developed the good practice guidance for the LULUCF sector. 11. Neither the order nor the notations of the columns, rows or cells should be changed in the tables as this will complicate data compilation. Any additions to the existing disaggregation of source and sink categories should be provided under “Other”, if appropriate. 12. To simplify the layout of the tables and indicate clearly the specific reporting requirements for each table, only those cells that require entries by Parties have been left blank. Slight shading in cells indicates that they are expected to be filled in by software to be provided by the secretariat. However, Parties that choose not to use any software for completing the CRF would have to provide entries in those cells as well. 13. As in the current CRF, dark shading has been used in those cells that are not expected to contain any information.

Adopts the revised guidelines for the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, contained in the annex to this decision,; 2. Decides to apply the above-mentioned guidelines for the technical reviews of greenhouse gas inventories to begin in 2003, in accordance with decision 6/CP.5, taking into consideration that the reporting guidelines on annual inventories used by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention in 2003 will be those adopted by decision 3/CP.5; 3. Requests the secretariat to conduct individual reviews until the end of the year 2006, pending availability of resources, by coordinating specifically: The in-country review of eight inventories per year; (a) (b) The review of the remaining annually submitted inventories through centralized and desk reviews. In organizing these reviews, the secretariat should give priority to the centralized reviews and should ensure that desk reviews are conducted only within the two subsequent years following an in- country review; 4. Requests the secretariat to prepare a report assessing the implementation of these guidelines, taking into account, inter alia, the experience gained by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, the secretariat and the review experts, for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice at its first session in the year 2006. Annex GUIDELINES FOR THE TECHNICAL REVIEW OF GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES FROM PARTIES INCLUDED IN ANNEX I TO THE CONVENTION A. Objective 1. The objective of these guidelines is to promote consistency in the review of annual greenhouse gas (GHQG) inventories of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) and to establish a process for a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of national inventories. B. Purposes of the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories The purpose of the technical review of Annex I Parties’ GHG inventories is: (a) To ensure that the Conference of the Parties (COP) has adequate and reliable information on annual inventories and emission trends of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol; (b) To provide the COP with an objective, consistent, transparent, thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of the annual quantitative and qualitative inventory information submitted by Annex I Parties, and a technical assessment of the implementation of Annex I Parties’ commitments under Article 4, paragraph 1 (a) and Article 12, paragraph 1 (a), of the Convention; (c) To examine, in a facilitative and open manner, the reported inventory information for consistency with the guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories' and the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” as elaborated by the IPCC report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty ) . .3 Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; To assist Annex I Parties in improving the quality of their GHG inventories. (d) C. General approach 3. Greenhouse gas inventory submissions from all Annex I Parties will be subject to an annual technical review. The technical review process for GHG inventories, as outlined in these guidelines, comprises three stages which consider different aspects of the inventories in such a way that all of the purposes described above are achieved by the end of the process. The three stages are: Initial check of annual inventories; (a) Synthesis and assessment of annual inventories; and (b) Review of individual annual inventories. (c) In these guidelines, the guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories are referred to as the reporting guidelines. > In these guidelines, the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are referred to as the IPCC Guidelines. > In these guidelines, the IPCC report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance. 4. The stages of the technical review process complement each other so that, in general, for each Annex [ Party, one stage is concluded before the next one is undertaken. 5. At all stages of the inventory review process, individual Annex I Parties under review will have the opportunity to clarify issues or provide additional information. The secretariat will send to these Parties s of their status report, the synthesis and assessment report and a preliminary analysis of the respective Party’s inventory, and their individual inventory review report. Every effort will be made to reach agreement with each Party on the content of a report prior to its publication. In the case of a Party and the expert team being unable to agree on an issue, the Party may provide explanatory text to be included in a separate section of the report. D. Initial check of annual inventories 1. Scope 6. The secretariat will conduct annually an initial check of the annual GHG inventory submissions from Annex I Parties in order to determine promptly whether the information provided is complete and in the correct format, and to enable subsequent review stages to take place. 7. The initial check will cover the national inventory submission, in particular, the data submitted electronically in the common reporting format (CRF), and will determine: (a) Whether all sources, sinks and gases included in the IPCC Guidelines, as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, are reported; (b) Whether all tables of the common reporting format have been completed and any gaps have been explained in the CRF by use of notation keys (such as NE, NA, NO, IE, C)4 and whether there is frequent use of these notation keys; (c) Whether estimates for summary totals and individual source categories are provided in mass units and in CO, equivalent using the [IPCC global warming potential (GWP) values in accordance with the relevant decisions of the COP; (d) Whether emission estimates are provided for all required years (i.e., from the base year to the latest year in the current submission);’ Whether methodologies are indicated with notations in the CRF; (e) €3] Whether estimates for CO, emissions from fossil fuel combustion are reported using the IPCC Reference Approach in addition to estimates derived using national methods; (2) Whether actual and potential emission estimates for hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride are reported by individual chemical species; (h) Whether any recalculations are reported for the entire time series and explanatory information relating to these recalculations is provided in the CRF; (1) Whether all emissions are reported without adjustments related, for example, to climate variations or trade of electricity; In accordance with the reporting guidelines, if there are no changes in the previously submitted inventories, the national inventory report (NIR) should reference the inventory submission where the other years constitute the time series. 3) Whether emissions from fuel used in international transportation are reported separately from national totals; Whether key sources have been reported in the CRF as required by the reporting (k) guidelines; Whether the tables on uncertainties have been reported as required by the reporting v guidelines; Whether a national inventory report (NIR) has been submitted. (m) 2. Status reports 8. The results of the initial check for each Annex I Party will be published on the UNFCCC web site as a status report, mainly in a tabular format. The status report will, inter alia: Indicate the date of receipt by the secretariat; (a) Indicate whether the NIR and the CRF have been submitted; (b) (c) Determine whether the inventory information has been provided in the correct format as called for in the reporting guidelines; (d) Determine whether the submission is complete and will identify any gaps in the reported data, covering the elements listed in paragraph 7 above. 3. Timing 9. The initial check for each Annex I Party should be finalized and the status report published on the UNFCCC web site within seven weeks of the date of receipt of the submission by the secretariat. In general, the timetable for the initial check should conform to the following: (a) The secretariat should perform the initial check and prepare a status report within three weeks and send it to the Party for comments; Each Party should provide comments on the status report within three weeks. (b) E. Synthesis and assessment of annual inventories 1. Scope 10. The secretariat will conduct a synthesis and assessment of Annex I Parties’ greenhouse gas inventories to facilitate the consideration of inventory data and other information across Parties, and to identify issues for further consideration during the review of individual inventories. 11. The synthesis and assessment will cover the national inventory submission and previous national inventory submissions, where relevant, and will include a standardized set of data comparisons of: (a) Implied emission factors and other inventory data across Annex I Parties to identify any irregularities or inconsistencies; (b) Emission or removal estimates, activity data, implied emission factors and any recalculations with data from previous submissions to identify any irregularities or inconsistencies; (c) Activity data of each Annex I Party with relevant authoritative sources, if feasible, to identify cases where there are significant differences. 12. To facilitate the analysis of the inventory data, the secretariat will, for each individual Annex [ Party, identify and consider those sources that are key sources both in terms of their absolute level and in terms of their trend assessment, applying the tier 1 level assessment as described in the [PCC good practice guidance. In addition, the secretariat will also consider other sources (i.e., emissions from bunker fuels, emissions and removals from land-use change and forestry,® etc.) and non-key sources for which irregularities or inconsistencies are identified, based on their significance for specific sectors or for the whole GHG inventory. 2. Synthesis and assessment report 13. The synthesis and assessment will consist of two parts: part [ and part II, which are described in paragraphs 14 and 15 below, respectively. The results of part I will be published on the UNFCCC web site as a synthesis and assessment report. Part I, containing a preliminary analysis of individual Annex I Party inventories, will be sent to the respective Party for comments. The results of part 11, together with the comments provided by the respective Party, will be provided to the corresponding expert review team as input for the individual review. Part I: 14. The synthesis and assessment report (part I) will provide information to allow comparisons across Annex | Parties and to describe common methodological issues. This report will compile and compare information across Parties in a tabular and, as appropriate, graphical format, including: For key sources, based on the approach used by the secretariat, and other selected (a) Sources: Methodologies used in the preparation of the inventories; (i) Implied emission factors, default values and ranges contained in the IPCC Guidelines, as elaborated by the I[PCC good practice guidance; (i) Reported activity data and data from authoritative sources, if possible; (iii) Other information provided in the various CRF tables; (iv) (b) Estimates of CO, emissions from fuel combustion using the IPCC Reference Approach compared with estimates of CO, emissions from fuel combustion using a national (sectoral) approach; (c) Estimates of actual and potential emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride and the ratio between the actual and potential emissions; Inventory recalculations. (d) Part IT 15. The preliminary analysis of individual Annex I Party inventories (part II), will be based on the information contained in the synthesis and assessment report, and will, for each individual inventory: (a) Identify issues within source or sink categories requiring further consideration or clarification during the individual review stage; Identify any recurring problems with reporting; (b) Examine inventory recalculations and the consistency of the time series; (c) Assess the availability of documentation on: (d) National self-verification procedures or independent review in the technical review process; (i) The application of the IPCC good practice guidance, including estimations of uncertainties; (i) (e) Assess the consistency of information on methodologies and emission factors in the CRF with related information in the NIR. 3. Timing 16. The synthesis and assessment will be conducted annually and should, in general, conform to the following timetable: (a) The secretariat will complete the synthesis and assessment report (part I), containing the elements in paragraph 14 above, within 10 weeks from the due date for submission.” The secretariat will incorporate all submissions and any re-submissions from Annex I Parties that were provided as a response to the status report and were received within six weeks from the due date for submissions. Parties should provide comments within three weeks of receipt of the synthesis and assessment report. If possible, the secretariat should complete a synthesis and assessment of the GHG inventories submitted after that date and should publish these assessments as separate documents (addenda to the synthesis and assessment report) provided that this does not delay the review process for other Annex | Parties; (b) The preliminary analysis of individual Annex I Party inventories (part II of the synthesis and assessment), containing the elements in paragraph 15 above, will be completed at the latest four weeks prior to the scheduled individual review for the Party concerned. The secretariat will send a of the preliminary analysis to the Party at the latest seven weeks prior to the scheduled individual review, and the Party will provide comments within three weeks. The preliminary analysis and the Party’s comments will be forwarded to the expert review team for further consideration. F. Review of individual annual inventories 1. Scope 17. Expert review teams, coordinated by the secretariat, will conduct reviews of individual greenhouse gas inventories in order to assess whether the COP has adequate and reliable information on annual GHG inventories. The individual reviews will provide for a detailed examination of the inventory estimates, procedures and methodologies used in the preparation of inventories, covering each Annex [ Party’s national inventory submission, supplementary material submitted by the Party and, as In accordance with decision 3/CP.5, the due date for submission of the GHG inventories of Annex I Parties is 15 April of each year. appropriate, previous inventory submissions. The results of this stage of the review process will be communicated to Parties. 18. Three operational approaches may be used during this stage of the technical review, namely desk reviews, centralized reviews and in-country reviews, assuming available resources. During a desk review, inventory information of Annex I Parties will be sent to experts, who will conduct the review in their own countries. During a centralized review, the experts will meet in a single location to review the inventory information of Annex I Parties. During an in-country review, experts will visit an Annex | Party to review the inventory information of this Party. 19. The review of most individual inventories of Annex I Parties will be conducted annually as a desk review or as a centralized review. In addition, the GHG inventory of each Annex I Party will be subject to an in-country visit by an expert review team once every five years. In a year when an in- country review is scheduled, a desk or centralized review of the Party’s GHG inventory will not take place. In-country visits will be scheduled, planned and take place with the consent of, and close coordination with, the Party subject to review. In general, during a centralized review, up to eight GHG inventories should be reviewed; during a desk review up to five GHG inventories should be reviewed. 20. Expert review teams should pay particular attention to those areas of the inventory where problems have been identified in previous reviews, or stages of the review, or where changes have been reported by the Party. Expert review teams should not perform an individual review in cases where a NIR has not been provided. Each expert review team will: 21. (a) Examine application of the requirements of the reporting guidelines and the [IPCC Guidelines, as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, and identify any departure from these requirements; (b) Examine whether the IPCC good practice guidance was applied and documented, in particular noting the identification of key source categories, selection and use of methodologies and assumptions, development and selection of emission factors, collection and selection of activity data, reporting of recalculations and consistent time-series, reporting of uncertainties related to inventory estimates, methodologies used for estimating those uncertainties and quality assurance and quality control procedures, and identify any inconsistencies; (c) Compare emission or removal estimates, activity data, implied emission factors and any recalculations with data from previous submissions of the Party included in Annex I to identify any irregularities or inconsistencies; (d) Identify any missing sources and examine any explanatory information relating to their exclusion from the GHG inventory; (e) Identify the reason for any differences between the Party’s and the secretariat’s key source determination; Assess the consistency of information in the CRF with that in the NIR; ) (2) Assess the extent to which issues raised in the synthesis and assessment of annual inventories, and issues and questions raised by expert review teams in previous reports have been addressed and resolved; (h) Identify areas for further improvement of the inventories and note possible ways for improving the estimation and the reporting of inventory information. 22. In addition to the tasks mentioned in paragraph 21 above, expert review teams conducting in- country reviews will consider the “paper trail” of the inventory from the collection of data to the reported emission estimates and will examine procedures and institutional arrangements for inventory development and management, including quality assurance and quality control, record-keeping and documentation procedures. During subsequent desk or centralized reviews, the expert review teams will identify any changes that may have occurred in these procedures and institutional arrangements, based on the information provided in the NIRs of Annex I Parties. 23. The expert review team may use relevant technical information in the review process, such as information from international organizations 2. Expert review teams General procedures 24. Each GHG inventory submission will be assigned to a single expert review team that will be responsible for performing the review in accordance with the procedures and time frames established in these guidelines. A submission by an Annex I Party will not be reviewed in two successive years by expert review teams with an identical composition. 25. Each expert review team will provide a thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of the GHG information submitted and will, under its collective responsibility, prepare a review report in accordance with the provisions of these guidelines. 26. Expert review teams will be coordinated by the secretariat which will provide administrative support, and, as appropriate, technical and methodological assistance and assistance in the use of the UNFCCC guidelines. 27. Expert review teams will be composed of experts selected on an ad hoc basis from the UNFCCC roster of experts and will include lead reviewers. Experts will be nominated by Parties to the Convention to the roster of experts and, as appropriate, by intergovernmental organizations, in accordance with guidance provided for this purpose by the COP. Participating experts will serve in their personal capacity and will neither be nationals of the Party under review nor be nominated or funded by that Party. 28. In the conduct of the review, expert review teams shall adhere to these guidelines and work on the basis of established and published procedures, including quality assurance and control and confidentiality provisions in accordance with the relevant decisions adopted by the COP. 29. The secretariat will notify Annex I Parties about up-coming desk and centralized reviews, and ask the Parties to identify the contact person(s) through whom enquiries could be directed. Communication between the expert review teams and the Party under review should be through the lead reviewers and the designated contact person(s) of the Party. Other members of the expert review team may communicate directly with the national experts involved in the GHG inventory preparation only if a Party so agrees. Information thus obtained should be made available to other members of the team. 30. Participating experts from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties) and Annex I Parties with economies in transition will be funded according to the existing procedures for participation in UNFCCC activities. Experts from other Annex I Parties will be funded by their governments. Composition of the expert review teams 31. Participating experts shall have experience in the area of GHG inventories in general and/or in specific sectors (Energy, Industrial Processes, Solvents and Other Products Use, Agriculture, Land-Use Change and Forestry and Waste). 32. Expert review teams may vary in size and composition, taking into account the national circumstances of the Party under review and the different expertise needs. In general, the normal size of the expert review teams should be: (a) Six experts for in-country visits (one expert per inventory sector® plus one generalist’); (b) Twelve experts for desk and centralized reviews (two experts per inventory sector® plus two generalists’). (a) 33. The secretariat will select the members of the review teams in a way that will ensure that the collective skills of the team address the areas mentioned in paragraph 31 above and that most experts in the ERTs have the necessary experience in the review process. The secretariat will select national inventory experts with limited or no experience of the review process and invite one of these experts to participate in each in-country review, with a maximum of five experts to participate in each centralized review. These experts with limited or no experience of the review process will work on a specific IPCC sector together with an expert with experience of the review process. Desk reviews will be conducted only by experienced experts. 34. The secretariat will select the members of the expert review teams with a view to achieving a balance between experts from Annex I Parties and non-Annex I Parties in the overall composition of the expert review teams, without compromising the selection criteria referred to in paragraph 31 above. The secretariat shall make every effort to ensure geographical balance among those experts selected from non-Annex | Parties and among those experts selected from Annex I Parties. 35. Without compromising the criteria stated in paragraphs 31 to 34 above, the formation of expert review teams should ensure, to the extent possible, that at least one member is fluent in the language of the Party under review. Lead reviewers 36. For each expert review team, two inventory experts with substantial inventory review experience will serve as lead reviewers. One lead reviewer will be from a non-Annex I Party and one from an Annex | Party. 37. Lead reviewers should ensure that the review in which they participate is performed according to these guidelines and is performed consistently across all Annex I Parties under review by the expert review team. They should also ensure the quality and the objectivity of the technical assessments in the reviews. ¥ The expert(s) dealing with the Industrial Processes sector should also be responsible for the Solvents and Other Products Use sector, which, in general, does not constitute a major source of GHG emissions. ? The term “generalist” in these guidelines is used for experts who have broad knowledge of all areas of the inventory process. With the support of the secretariat, lead reviewers will: 38. Prepare a brief work plan for the review activity; (a) (b) Verify that the experts have all the necessary information provided by the secretariat prior to the review activity; Monitor the progress of the review activity; (c) Ensure that there is good communication within the expert review team; (d) (e) Coordinate queries of the expert review team to the Party and coordinate the inclusion of the answers in the review reports; Provide technical advice to the ad hoc experts, if needed; (2) Ensure that the review is performed and the review report is prepared in accordance with these guidelines; and (h) Verify that the review team gives priority to individual source categories for review in accordance with these guidelines. 3. Individual review reports 39. Under its collective responsibility, the expert review team will produce an individual inventory review report for publication in electronic format on the UNFCCC web site based on the results of the tasks listed in paragraph 21 above. The review reports should contain an objective assessment of the adherence of the inventory information to the reporting guidelines and the provisions of relevant decisions by the COP and should not contain any political judgement. 40. The report of all in-country reviews should not exceed 25-30 pages including a 2-3 page summary. For desk and centralized reviews, the report should not exceed 10 pages and should focus on particular strengths and identified problems as well as on an overall appraisal of the quality and reliability of the inventory, emission trends, actual emission factors and activity data, and on the degree of adherence to the reporting guidelines and the IPCC good practice guidance. Both types of review reports should include standardized tables, whenever possible, to increase the efficiency of communication. 4. Timing 41. The secretariat should forward all relevant information to the members of the expert review teams one month prior to the start of the review activities. Each desk or centralized review should be completed within 20 weeks and 22 weeks, respectively, and each in-country review should be completed within 14 weeks. In general, the timetable for the individual review activities, assuming available resources, should conform to the following: (a) Desk review each expert review team performs individual reviews and prepares review reports within seven weeks (three weeks for individual reviews and four weeks for the preparation of the reports). The secretariat edits and formats the reports and sends them to the respective Annex I Party for comments. The Parties respond within four weeks. The expert review team integrates the Parties’ comments within four weeks and sends the revised versions of the reports to the secretariat. The final reports are published on the UNFCCC web site within two weeks. (b) Centralized review: each expert review team performs individual reviews and prepares review reports within ten weeks (up to eight working days for individual reviews and nine weeks for the preparation of the reports). The secretariat edits and formats the reports and sends them to the respective Annex [ Party for comments. The Parties respond within four weeks. The expert review team integrates the Parties’ comments within six weeks and sends the revised versions of the reports to the secretariat. The final reports are published on the UNFCCC web site within two weeks. (c) In-country review: each expert review team performs the individual review within one week and prepares a review report within three weeks. The secretariat edits and formats the report and sends it to the respective Annex Party for comments. The Party responds within four weeks. The expert review team integrates the Party’s comments within three weeks and sends the revised version of the report to the secretariat. The final report is published on the UNFCCC web site within one week. G. Annual report of emissions and trends of greenhouse gases 42. As part of the technical review of annual national GHG inventories, the secretariat will also compile and tabulate aggregate information and trends concerning greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, and any other inventory information in a stand-alone document to be published electronically on the UNFCCC web site. This document will draw information from the latest available GHG inventory submissions of all Annex I Parties and will serve to provide aggregate information to the COP on GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks and their trends for all Annex I Parties. This document may also be used as an input to the third stage of the technical review process. 43. A summary of the document mentioned in paragraph 42 above will be published in both hard copy and electronic format for the consideration of the COP and the subsidiary bodies.'® This summary will include trends of GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks and an assessment of the adherence of the reported inventory information to the reporting guidelines, as well as to the provisions of relevant decisions by the COP, including, inter alia, information on any delays in submitting the annual inventory information. ' In order to ensure the quality and timeliness of the information included in this summary, the secretariat will prepare this report for the consideration of the Convention bodies during the second sessional period scheduled for each year.",06/12/2002,2002_471009,Canada,"* NE = not estimated, NA = not applicable, NO = not occurring, IE = included elsewhere, C = confidential.",yes

Document FCCC/SBI/2002/L.../Add.1 Annex Work programme on Article 6 of the Convention A. Observations 1. The implementation of all elements of Article 6 of the Convention, including education, training, public awareness, public participation, public access to information and international cooperation, will contribute to meeting the objective of the Convention 2. All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities, are responsible for the implementation of Article 6 of the Convention. The capacity to implement Article 6 activities will vary among countries, as will the priority thematic areas and target audiences, consistent with their sustainable development priorities and the culturally preferred method of programme delivery, in order to increase people’s understanding of the climate change issue. 3. Regional, subregional and international cooperation can enhance the collective ability of Parties to implement the Convention, improve synergies, avoid duplication of effort between the different conventions, and ultimately both improve the effectiveness of programming and facilitate its support. 4. It is important to learn more from countries regarding the needs and gaps in their Article 6 activities, so that Parties, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that have the resources to do so might effectively target their efforts at providing appropriate support. 5. Many Parties, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and community- based organizations, as well as the private and public sectors, are already working actively to raise awareness on, and increase understanding of, the causes and impacts of climate change, as well as solutions. In particular, many governments are already implementing measures that could be linked to Article 6 activities. However, the lack of adequate financial and technical resources could inhibit some Parties’ efforts to implement such activities, in particular developing country Parties. 6. The nature of Article 6 activities carried out by Parties can easily be reported. However, measuring or quantifying the impacts of these activities may be more challenging. B. Purposes and guiding principles 7. The present work programme sets out the scope of, and provides the basis for action on, activities related to Article 6, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. It should serve as a flexible framework for country-driven action addressing the specific needs and circumstances of Parties, and reflecting their national priorities and initiatives. 8. The Article 6 work programme builds on existing decisions of the Conference of the Parties, specifically the Marrakesh Accords, which contain a number of references to Article 6 activities, in particular decisions 2/CP.7 and 3/CP7 on capacity-building in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition, 4/CP.7 on development and transfer of technologies, and 5/CP.7 on implementation of Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9. The Article 6 work programme shall be guided by: A country-driven approach; (a) Cost-effectiveness; (b) (c) A phased approach integrating Article 6 activities into existing climate change programmes and strategies; Promotion of partnerships, networks and synergies, in particular, synergies between (d) conventions; An interdisciplinary approach; ©) A holistic, systematic approach; The principles of sustainable development. (9] C. Scope of the work programme 10. As part of their national programmes to implement the Convention, and taking into account national circumstances and capacities, Parties are encouraged to undertake activities under the categories listed below, which reflect the six elements of Article 6. International cooperation 11. Subregional, regional and international cooperation in undertaking activities within the scope of the work programme can enhance the collective ability of Parties to implement the Convention, and the efforts of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations can also contribute to its implementation. Such cooperation can further enhance synergies between conventions and improve the effectiveness of all sustainable development efforts. FEducation 12. In order to advance implementation of Article 6 of the Convention, it is useful to cooperate in, promote, facilitate, develop and implement education and training programmes focused on climate change, targeting youth in particular, and including exchange or secondment of personnel to train experts. Training 13. In order to advance implementation of Article 6 of the Convention, it is useful to cooperate in, promote, facilitate, develop and implement climate change focused training programmes for scientific, technical, and managerial personnel at the national and, as appropriate, subregional, regional and international levels. Technical skills and knowledge provide an opportunity to adequately address and respond to climate change issues Public awareness, public participation and public access to information 14. In order to advance implementation of Article 6 of the Convention, it is useful to cooperate in, promote, facilitate, develop and implement public awareness programmes on climate change and its effects at the national and, as appropriate, subregional, regional and international levels. It is also useful to facilitate public access to information on climate change and its effects, and to promote public participation in addressing climate change and its effects and developing adequate responses. D. Implementation Parties 15. As part of their national programmes and activities in implementing the Convention, and within the scope of the Article 6 work programme, Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional development priorities and capacities, could, inter alia: (a) Develop institutional and technical capacity to identify gaps and needs for the implementation of Article 6, assess the effectiveness of Article 6 activities, and consider the linkages between Article 6 activities, implementation of policies and measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and other commitments under the Convention, such as technology transfer and capacity-building; (b) Prepare assessments of needs specific to national circumstances in the area of the implementation of Article 6, including the use of surveys and other relevant instruments to determine target audiences and potential partnerships; (c) Designate, and provide support to, a national focal point for Article 6 activities and assign specific responsibilities. These responsibilities could include the identification of areas for possible international cooperation and opportunities for strengthening synergies with other conventions, and the coordination of the preparation of the Article 6 chapter in the national communication, ensuring that relevant contact information, including web-site addresses, is provided therein; (d) Develop a directory of organizations and individuals, with an indication of their experience and expertise relevant to Article 6 activities, with a view to building active networks involved in the implementation of these activities; (e) Develop criteria for identifying and disseminating information on good practices for Article 6 activities, in accordance with national circumstances; 6] Increase the availability of copyright-free and translated climate change materials, in accordance with laws and standards related to the protection of copyrighted materials; (2) Enhance efforts to develop and use curricula and teacher training focused on climate change as methods to integrate climate change issues at all educational levels and across disciplines; (h) Seek opportunities to disseminate widely relevant information on climate change. Measures could include translation into appropriate languages and distribution of popularized versions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report and other key documents on climate change; 1) Seek input and public participation, including participation by youth and other groups, in the formulation and implementation of efforts to address climate change and encourage the involvement and participation of representatives of all stakeholders and major groups in the climate change negotiation process; G) Inform the public about causes of climate change and sources of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as actions that can be taken at all levels to address climate change; (k) Share the findings contained in their national communications and national action plans or domestic programmes on climate change with the general public and all stakeholders. 16. In developing and implementing Article 6 activities, Parties should seek to enhance cooperation and coordination at international and regional levels, including the identification of partners and networks with other Parties, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, state and local governments, and community-based organizations, and to promote and facilitate the exchange of information and material, and the sharing of experience and good practices. Intergovernmental organizations Intergovernmental organizations, including convention secretariats, are invited, inter alia: 17. (a) To continue supporting efforts to implement activities under Article 6 through their regular programmes, and through specific programmes focused on climate change, including, as appropriate, through the provision and dissemination of information and resource materials, such as diagrams that could easily be translated and adapted, as well as through the provision of financial and technical support; (b) To strengthen collaboration with, and enhance involvement of, other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, with a view to ensuring coordinated support to Parties in their activities related to Article 6 and avoiding duplication of work. Non-governmental organizations 18. Non-governmental organizations are encouraged to continue their activities related to Article 6 and are invited to consider ways to enhance cooperation between non-governmental organizations from Annex I and non-Annex I countries, as well as collaboration on activities between intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and governments. Support 19. Parties will need to determine the most efficient and cost-effective way to implement Article 6 activities, and are encouraged to create partnerships with other Parties, as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and relevant stakeholders, to facilitate the implementation of these activities, including the identification of priority areas for support and funding. 20. As initial priorities, the implementation of the work programme will require the strengthening of national institutions and capacities, in particular in developing countries, and the establishment of a mechanism to provide and exchange information. Review of progress and reporting 21. The Conference of the Parties, through the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, will undertake a review of progress in the implementation of this work programme by 2007, with an intermediate review of progress in 2004. 22. All Parties are requested to report in their national communications, where possible, and in other reports, on their accomplishments, lessons learned, experiences gained, and remaining gaps and barriers observed. 23. Intergovernmental organizations are invited to develop programmatic responses to the Article 6 work programme and, following consultations with the Convention secretariat, to communicate to the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice through the secretariat the responses and progress achieved, for the purpose of reviewing the programme and evaluating its effectiveness in 2004 and 2007. 24, Non-governmental organizations are invited to provide relevant information to the secretariat and in accordance with their national circumstances, informing and involving their national focal point as appropriate, on progress achieved for the purpose of reviewing the Article 6 work programme and evaluating its effectiveness in 2004 and 2007.
