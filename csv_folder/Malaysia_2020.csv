18 December 2019 and Council resolution 34/15 of 24 March 2017, GE.20-03818(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/43/L.3 Recognizing that birth registration and the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law is closely linked to the realization of all other human rights, and therefore underlining the importance of a human rights-based approach to birth registration, based on international human rights obligations and commitments operationally directed at respecting, promoting, protecting and fulfilling human rights, and at preventing human rights violations, Welcoming the commitment of States to leave no one behind, and recalling that the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration, is included as the standalone target 16.9 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development under Sustainable Development Goal 16, and taking note with interest of the report entitled “Birth Registration for Every Child by 2030: Are we on track?”, published by the United Nations

protection, protection in emergencies, access to financial and economic resources, the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and children everywhere, and access to quality education, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other treaty-based bodies towards universal birth registration, such as through recommendations widely addressed to States in this regard, Recognizing the importance of birth registration, including late birth registration and the provision of documents of proof of birth, as a means of providing an official record of the existence of a person and the recognition of that individual as a person before the law, and as a critical means of preventing statelessness, Expressing concern that unregistered individuals may have limited or no access to services and the enjoyment of all the rights to which they are entitled, including the rights to a name and to acquire a nationality, and rights relating to health, education, property and inheritance, social welfare, work and political participation, and taking into consideration that registering a person’s birth is a vital step towards respect for and the protection and fulfilment of all their human rights, and that persons without birth registration are more vulnerable to poverty, marginalization, exclusion, discrimination, violence, statelessness, abduction, sale, exploitation and abuse, including when they take the form of child labour, human trafficking, child, early and forced marriage, other harmful practices, illegal adoption and child recruitment, Bearing in mind that certain groups, such as nomadic and border populations, minorities, refugees, internally displaced persons, migrants, abandoned, orphaned, unaccompanied or separated children, indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities are at particular risk of statelessness, because their situation makes it difficult for them to register births or to obtain related documents, thereby hindering the full realization of their human rights, Recognizing that armed conflict and emergencies can be a cause and a consequence of statelessness, rendering women and girls particularly vulnerable to various forms of abuse in both the private and public domains, and that statelessness can arise when women’s experience of conflict intersects with discrimination with regard to nationality rights, such as laws that require women to change nationality upon marriage or its dissolution or that deny them the ability to pass on their nationality, Being fully aware of the fact that non-registration of children at birth may represent a major impediment to the enjoyment of civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights, Recognizing that free birth registration and free or low-fee late birth registration are part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that non-governmental organizations, professional associations, the media, the private sector and other members of civil society, including those involved in public-private partnerships, can also contribute to the improvement and promotion of A/HRC/43/L.3 community awareness of birth registration in a manner that reflects national priorities and strategies, 1.

Reaffirms that the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration by 2030, can contribute to prevent, inter alia, poverty, marginalization, exclusion, discrimination, violence, statelessness, illegal adoption, abduction, sale, exploitation and abuse, including when it takes the form of child labour, human trafficking, child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices, and child recruitment, and can also assist in the reunification of families separated by conflict, disaster or humanitarian crisis; 4.

The establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was proposed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit, held in June 2009. The Heads of State and Government of the States members of ASEAN and of the Republic of Korea expressed appreciation for and welcomed the proposal. 2. A number of sessions were organized among the forestry officials of 11 countries over a period of two years to negotiate the text of the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of ASEAN and the Republic of Korea on Forest Cooperation. The Agreement was formally signed at the fourteenth ASEAN- Republic of Korea Summit on 18 November 2011 and came into effect on 5 August 2012. II. New dialogue initiative 3. A new dialogue on the establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was organized on a multilateral platform, with invitations sent to Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Timor-Leste. The platform covered a wide range of geographically diverse areas, ranging from coastal islands and glaciated mountains to central Asian deserts. The Agreement on the Establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was negotiated through six successive dialogues held between 2013 and 2015 among States members and prospective members of ASEAN. The Agreement was adopted on 22 September 2015 by 14 countries: Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Timor- Leste and Viet Nam. It entered into force on 27 April 2018. 4. The aim of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is to strengthen forest cooperation by transforming proven technologies and policies into concrete actions in the area of sustainable forest management, in order to address the impact of climate change. Il. Membership 5. As of July 2020, the following 13 countries had ratified and deposited their instruments and are officially registered as members of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization: ¢ Bhutan ¢ Brunei Darussalam ¢ Kazakhstan ¢ Lao People’s Democratic Republic * Mongolia ¢ Myanmar ¢ Philippines 3/21 A/75/192 7. In accordance with article 5 of the Agreement, membership is open to countries geographically located in Asia. The Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is open to engaging with partner countries beyond the region. IV. Purpose and function 8. The vision of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is that of a greener Asia with resilient forests, landscapes and communities. Its missions are to strengthen cooperation among member countries and global and regional players in the forest sector, and to promote action-oriented sustainable forest management practices through policy support, capacity development and inclusive partnerships, in order to address the adverse impacts of climate change. 9. These missions are realized through the implementation of programmes and projects to address environmental degradation in member countries that is compounded by the changing climate. In its plans and actions, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization adheres to the core values of partnership, member- centrality, transparency, competency, equity and sustainability. Its five-year strategic plan identifies the following priority areas of intervention: (a) The initiation of customized restoration and reforestation models; (b) Support for research and development in climate change adaptation approaches; (c) Systematic management of forest-related disasters; (d) The improvement of local livelihoods and the development of community- based small enterprises; (ec) The strengthening of institutional capabilities, the diversification of resources and the promotion of regional actions. 10. As an outcome, the actions taken by the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization contribute to the achievement of broader global targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals; the global forest goals; nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Aichi Biodiversity Targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity; the land degradation neutrality targets of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; and the Bonn Challenge. Response to the efforts of global community in the forest sector 11. As noted in the background study prepared for the fourteenth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, forests are the second largest storehouses of carbon, absorbing and storing about 30 per cent of current levels of carbon emissions in their biomass, soil and wood, and have the potential to store much more. However, forests also account for greenhouse gas emissions as a result of deforestation caused 4/21 A/75/192 by forest fires, diseases and pests. By mainly focusing on the forest sector, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization has unique strengths and potential as an intergovernmental organization, since its member counties are in the Asian region, which includes diverse landscapes, ranging from glaciated high mountains and drylands to one of the world’s largest tropical forests. 12. As identified in its strategic plan, the priority intervention areas of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization are in keeping with efforts by the global community to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It implements activities directly linked to the global forest goals set out in the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030 and translates them into actions on the ground in the Asian region. Reflecting the needs of its member countries, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization implements projects that protect and restore degraded forests and increases the involvement of local communities in forest-related activities in order to improve their livelihoods and help them to practice sustainable forest management. 13. The Asian Forest Cooperation Organization also implements biodiversity conservation projects, including activities for ecosystem services and for the conservation of genetic resources. It further aims to contribute to global biodiversity goals by taking account of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. VI. Programmes and projects 14. Since 2011, under the partnership between ASEAN and the Republic of Korea in the forest sector, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization has embarked on many capacity-building programmes, subregional projects and individual country-driven projects. Nearly $32 million has been contributed to areas ranging from policy support interventions to engaging villagers in forest restoration and rehabilitation activities. The objectives of (a) capacity-building programmes; (b) seven subregional projects; and (c) three projects in individual countries, all of which primarily contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 15, are highlighted below: (a) Capacity-building programmes 15. Many training courses have been conducted to strengthen the capacities of diverse stakeholder groups of the member countries of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization by enhancing knowledge and understanding of forest management and providing better access to relevant information, skills and technology. 16. One highlight includes the establishment of the Regional Education and Training Centre in Myanmar. In 2019, training courses by the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization benefited more than 4,000 people belonging to various stakeholder groups, with a ratio of participating women and men of 47:53. As part of its ongoing programmes, the Organization has provided scholarships to some 19 Masters and doctorate students.

Except as provided in rule 44, the Conference may vote by show of hands, except that a representative may request a roll call, which shall then be taken in the English alphabetical order of the names of the States participating in the Conference, beginning with the delegation whose name is drawn by lot by the presiding President. The name of each State shall be called in all roll calls, and its representative shall reply “yes”, “no” or “abstention”. 2. When the Conference votes by mechanical means, a non-recorded vote shall replace a vote by show of hands and a recorded vote shall replace a roll call. A representative may request a recorded vote, which shall, unless a representative requests otherwise, be taken without calling out the names of the States participating in the Conference. 3. The vote of each State participating in a roll-call or a recorded vote shall be inserted in any record of or report on the meeting. Rule 38 Conduct during voting After the presiding President has announced the commencement of voting, no representative shall interrupt the voting, except on a point of order in connection with the actual conduct of the voting. Rule 39 Explanation of vote 1. Representatives may make brief statements, consisting solely of explanations of vote, before the voting has commenced or after the voting has been completed. The presiding President may limit the time to be allowed for such explanations.

When the same matter is considered successively in several organs of the Conference, a State should, as far as possible, explain its vote only in one such organ, unless its vote in one organ is different from that in another organ. Rule 40 Division of proposals A representative may move that parts of a proposal be decided on separately. If a representative objects, the motion for division shall be voted upon. Permission to speak on the motion shall be accorded to only two representatives in favour of and to two opposing the division. If the motion is carried, those parts of the proposal that are subsequently approved shall be put to the Conference for decision as a whole. If all operative parts of the proposal have been rejected, the proposal shall be considered to have been rejected as a whole. Rule 41 Amendments A proposal is considered an amendment to another proposal if it merely adds to, deletes from or revises part of that proposal. Unless specified otherwise, the word “proposal” in these rules shall be regarded as including amendments. Rule 42 Order of voting on amendments When an amendment is moved to a proposal, the amendment shall be voted on first. When two or more amendments are moved to a proposal, the Conference shall vote first on the amendment furthest removed in substance from the original proposal and then on the amendment next furthest removed therefrom, and so on, until all the amendments have been put to the vote. Where, however, the adoption of one amendment necessarily implies the rejection of another amendment, the latter shall not be put to the vote. If one or more amendments are adopted, the amended proposal shall then be voted upon. Rule 43 Order of voting on proposals 1. If two or more proposals, other than amendments, relate to the same question, they shall, unless the Conference decides otherwise, be voted on in the order in which they were submitted. The Conference may, after each vote on a proposal, decide whether to vote on the next proposal. 2. Revised proposals shall be voted on in the order in which the original proposals were submitted, unless the revision substantially departs from the original proposal. In that case, the original proposal shall be regarded as withdrawn and the revised proposal shall be treated as a new proposal. 3. A motion requiring that no decision be taken on a proposal shall be put to the vote before a decision is taken on the proposal in question. Rule 44 Elections All elections shall be held by secret ballot unless, in the absence of any objection, the Conference decides to proceed without taking a ballot when there is an agreed candidate or slate of candidates. 19/23 Rule 45 Balloting 1. When one or more elective places are to be filled at one time under the same conditions, those candidates, in a number not exceeding the number of such places, obtaining in the first ballot a majority of the votes cast and the largest number of votes shall be elected. 2. If the number of candidates obtaining such majority is less than the number of places to be filled, additional ballots shall be held to fill the remaining places, the voting being restricted to the candidates obtaining the largest number of votes in the previous ballot, to a number not more than twice the places remaining to be filled.
