In addition, it considered two priority themes, “Strategic foresight for the post-2015 development agenda” and “Digital development”, and held panel discussions on the two themes. The session also included a segment on science, technology and innovation policy reviews. Two ministerial round tables were convened during the session, one on the theme “Managing the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the sustainable development goals: the role of science, technology and innovation”, and another on the theme “Ten-year review of progress made in the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society”. The Chair’s summary of the discussion on the theme “Managing the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the sustainable development goals: the role of science, technology and innovation” (E/2015/78) is transmitted to the high- level segment of the 2015 session of the Economic and Social Council, to be held in July 2015 on the theme “Managing the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the sustainable development goals: what it will take?” During the discussions on the theme, participants noted the critical role and contribution of science, technology and innovation in building and maintaining national competitiveness, addressing global challenges and realizing sustainable development. Likewise, they recognized the instrumental role of science, technology and innovation in the achievement of a number of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the role of science, technology and innovation, and of information and communications technologies (ICTs) as enablers of the post-2015 development agenda. The participants shared national success stories in harnessing the potential of science, technology and innovation and ICTs as tools for stimulating inclusive and sustainable growth and development. They agreed that the success of using technology and innovation policies is facilitated by, among other measures, creating policy environments that enable education and research institutions, businesses and industry to innovate, invest and transform science, technology and innovation into employment and economic growth. In this regard, they stressed the need for new approaches that embed policies on science, technology and innovation as crucial components of national development plans. Accordingly, participants called upon Governments to strengthen local innovation capabilities as a means of fostering inclusive and sustainable economic development. They recommended closely linking science, technology and innovation, and strategies of sustainable development by prominently featuring capacity-building in science, technology and innovation and ICTs in national planning. Likewise, Governments were encouraged to bring together local scientific, vocational and engineering knowledge; this effort could include collaboration with and among national programmes. Finally, participants highlighted the need to reduce barriers to equal access for women and girls to science and technology, as well as the need to integrate a gender perspective into development policies and programmes.

In addressing the priority theme “Strategic foresight for the post-2015 development agenda”, an expert panel discussed the potential role of strategic foresight in the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the sustainable development goals. There was wide acknowledgement that technology foresight exercises could help policymakers and stakeholders in the future implementation of the post-2015 development agenda, through the identification of development challenges and opportunities that could be addressed strategically. Participants encouraged Governments, individually and collectively, to undertake systemic research, including foresight exercises, on new trends in science, technology and innovation and ICT, and their impact on development, in particular in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. Furthermore, the participants recommended using strategic foresight exercises to identify potential gaps in education for the medium and long term, and addressing such gaps with a policy mix, including the promotion of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and vocational training. Particular attention was given to the ongoing and persistent gender gap in the fields of science, technology and innovation as a whole, and STEM education in particular, and the need to attract and retain women and girls in STEM fields. The participants agreed that strategic foresight should be used as a process to encourage structured debate among all stakeholders, including representatives of Government, science, industry and civil society and the private sector (in particular small and medium-sized enterprises), and that these debates could help to create a shared understanding of long-term issues and build consensus on future policies. Governments were also encouraged to undertake strategic foresight initiatives on global and regional challenges at regular intervals and cooperate towards the establishment of a mapping system to review and share technology foresight outcomes, including pilot projects. The participants called upon the Commission on Science and Technology for Development to act as a forum for strategic planning and for providing foresight about critical trends in science, technology and innovation and ICTs in key sectors of the economy, drawing attention to emerging and disruptive technologies. Likewise, participants requested that the Commission raise awareness and facilitate networking and partnerships between various technology foresight organizations, in collaboration with other stakeholders, with the objective of improving international cooperation in emerging technology foresight tools and methodologies. In considering the priority theme “Digital development”, the expert panel analysed the emerging changes in the digital development landscape with regard to digital technologies, digital demographics and development priorities, including the seminal role of digital development in sustainable development. The panellists agreed that a well-developed digital ecosystem, involving components such as technological infrastructure, data infrastructure, financial infrastructure, institutional infrastructure and human infrastructure, is a primary requirement for effective digital development. Pursuant to paragraph 57 of Economic and Social Council resolution 2014/27, the Commission organized a substantive discussion on the 10-year review report on the progress made in the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society, and is reporting thereon, through the Council, to the General Assembly as it makes an overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit in 2015 (see annex II).

Likewise, Governments were encouraged to put in place policies that would provide support for the development of digital ecosystems that are inclusive and encourage the development of local content and attract and support private investment, innovation and entrepreneurship. The participants highlighted the need for Governments to encourage digital natives to play a key role in community-based approaches to capacity-building for science, technology and innovation, and to facilitate the use of ICTs in the context of the post-2015 development agenda. Under the agenda item on science, technology and innovation policy reviews, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) presented the science, technology and innovation review of Thailand to the Commission. The review was undertaken in collaboration with the National Science Technology and Innovation Policy Office of Thailand. Participants congratulated Thailand for having undertaken this exercise of assessment and evaluation of its science, technology and innovation policies and commended UNCTAD for the quality of the report, the usefulness of its recommendations and the relevance of the review programme for developing countries. An exchange of views took place following the presentation of the science, technology and innovation policy review of Thailand, which enabled participants to discuss the policy issues highlighted in the review, as well as their own national experiences using science, technology and innovation to promote growth and development. One policy issue the participants discussed was the importance of implementing programmes that promote the commercialization of research outcomes. Comments also focused on the need for both policy continuity and monitoring and evaluation to transition from a natural-resource-based economy to one that is based on innovation, because developing a globally competitive economy requires years, if not decades, of deliberate policy choices supported by strategic investments aimed at building strong science, technology and innovation capacity. Participants agreed that investments were typically required in education and training (particularly in STEM), science, technology and innovation infrastructure and programmes, research and development. With regard to developing an economy based on innovation, participants stressed the importance of establishing effective institutional frameworks to promote the development of science, technology and innovation. Fostering public-private collaboration, especially among industry, research and Government, was seen as critical for success, as was international collaboration and support. Some participants addressed the issue of decentralization of science, technology and innovation policy, arguing that it could help to reduce capacity divides and inequalities among regions. Finally, a few participants reported that their countries were implementing or planning to implement a review of their national science, technology and innovation policies and expressed interest in undertaking science, technology and innovation review in collaboration with UNCTAD.

Pursuant to paragraph 57 of Economic and Social Council resolution 2014/27 of 16 July 2014, the Commission on Science and Technology for Development was requested to organize, during its eighteenth session (4-8 May 2015), a substantive discussion on the 10-year review report on the progress made in the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society and to report thereon, through the Council, to the General Assembly as it makes an overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit in 2015. The present report is provided in compliance with that request. Round table 2. A ministerial round table on the topic “Ten-year review of progress made in the implementation of World Summit on the Information Society outcomes” was convened during the afternoon of 4 May 2015. The round table began with keynote addresses by the Presidents of the preparatory committees of the Geneva and Tunis phases of the World Summit in 2003 and 2005, respectively. In their addresses, the Presidents stressed the challenges of transforming the digital divide into digital opportunity, guaranteeing the protection of cultural and linguistic diversity in the information society, accelerating progress towards the fulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals and ensuring the mainstreaming of information and communications technologies (ICTs) into the sustainable development goals and post-2015 development agenda. They emphasized a number of issues, including infrastructure development, affordability, knowledge management, education and capacity-building, multilingualism, human rights and cybersecurity. In their contributions, the Presidents noted the importance of placing development at the heart of the information society and of understanding its evolution in the context of rapidly changing technology, and the exponential deployment and application of ICTs, which were currently very different from those at the time of the Summit. 3. During the ensuing open discussion, participants noted that, while great progress had been made in increasing access to ICTs and meeting the goals set out at the World Summit, substantial divides remained in connectivity and access between and within developed and developing countries. Attention was drawn, in that context, to the extensive evidence provided in the report of the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), entitled Implementing World Summit on the Information Society Outcomes: A Ten-Year Review. Several speakers identified areas in which their countries had achieved significant progress, including interconnected Government, cybersecurity and ICT-enabled social and economic development. In addition, participants discussed the new opportunities presented by 39/43 E/2015/31 E/CN.16/2015/4 changing technology and the spread of ICTs, as well as challenges such as cybercrime, child protection, privacy and the protection of personal data, and the importance of ensuring an enabling environment for ICT development. 4. The importance of democratic, accountable and inclusive Internet governance was stressed by a number of speakers. Participants welcomed progress towards multi-stakeholder cooperation and dialogue in Internet governance, and many called for extension of the mandate of the Internet Governance Forum. Some participants also emphasized the importance of international cooperation in leveraging the benefits of innovation and meeting the challenges of ICTs, thereby achieving continued progress towards the World Summit’s vision of a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society. Substantive discussion 5. Consistent with Council resolution 2014/27, on 5 May 2015, a full day was devoted to substantive discussion on progress in implementing the outcomes of the World Summit. The Director of the Division on Technology and Logistics of UNCTAD opened the session by highlighting the aforementioned report, Implementing World Summit on the Information Society Outcomes: A Ten-year Review. The report was compiled from sources that included consultations with, and submissions from, United Nations agencies, Governments and other stakeholders; other 10-year review of the World Summit processes and outcome documents, including those from the high-level event on the 10-year review, coordinated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and organized in collaboration with UNCTAD, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and held in Geneva from 10 to 13 June 2014; the review event, entitled “Towards knowledge societies for peace and sustainable development”, organized by UNESCO, in collaboration with ITU, UNDP and UNCTAD, and held in Paris from 25 to 27 February 2013; as well as other published sources. The report presented detailed information on the implementation of the World Summit vision, targets and action lines, commitments concerning financial mechanisms and Internet governance and the implementation of multi-stakeholder cooperation and dialogue. 6. Participants thanked the secretariat for preparing the report and for the comprehensive presentation of evidence included in it. They drew on the report and their own experiences in a wide-ranging discussion of different aspects of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit and the developing information society. Many emphasized that, while considerable progress had been made in increasing access to ICTs and reducing the digital divide in basic services, there was evidence of continued and, in some cases, growing digital divides in many areas that were of great importance to maximizing the value of ICTs for development, including connectivity and affordable access to broadband services. Concern was expressed about the divide between developed and developing countries, the needs of least developed countries, the importance of continuing to address the gender divide and the need to ensure full inclusiveness in the information society, including for economically and socially marginalized groups. 7. Anumber of participants stressed that, while infrastructure was essential to the development of the information society, infrastructure alone could not achieve the 40/43 E/2015/31 E/CN.16/2015/4 goals of the World Summit. In achieving the human development goals of the outcome documents of the Summit, priority also needed to be given to education and capacity-building, to the development of local and multilingual content and to the affordability of access and services. The role of Governments in providing an enabling environment for investment and innovation in the provision of services was emphasized, as was the role of the private sector and development partners in financing infrastructure, developing applications and building local human capacity. Participants also drew attention to ethical and rights aspects of the information society, including access, freedom of expression and privacy. 8 It was noted that the outcome documents of the World Summit continued to provide a solid foundation for shaping the information society, putting the Summit’s vision of a people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented information society at the heart of the overall review. It was also noted that the vision set out at the Summit was still valid. At the same time, participants recognized the significance of rapid change and innovation in the ICT environment since the convening of the Summit, including the development of mobile Internet capabilities, social media, cloud computing, big data and the “Internet of Things”. These developments had opened up many new opportunities, while also bringing new challenges that needed to be addressed. Those opportunities and challenges should prompt the international community to reflect on priorities and to adjust the course of implementation of the outcomes of the Summit, where appropriate, without reopening decisions that had been taken at the Summit. 9. Many participants recognized the role of ICTs as important tools and enablers for inclusive social and economic development, with the capacity to provide solutions to development challenges that might be difficult to address through conventional approaches. In that context, a number of speakers emphasized the importance of mainstreaming ICTs into the sustainable development goals and the post-2015 development agenda, and called for synergies to be identified between the 10-year review of the World Summit and those processes. Internet governance and enhanced cooperation 10. There was considerable discussion on the topics of Internet governance and enhanced cooperation identified during the second phase of the World Summit. Various views were expressed concerning the process towards enhanced cooperation to enable Governments, on an equal footing, to carry out their roles and responsibilities in international public policy issues pertaining to the Internet. Some participants were of the view that there had been little progress in achieving this objective, in particular concerning the equal participation of Governments, and that the overall review should provide clear guidance concerning its operationalization. Others were of the opinion that substantial progress had already been achieved. 11. Many participants noted that the Internet Governance Forum had been successful in bringing together diverse stakeholders on an annual basis, facilitating substantive, topical workshops and networking, and fostering dialogue concerning various aspects of Internet governance. Several delegates noted that the Forum could be further strengthened and that further improvements could be made in its work, in particular with regard to its effectiveness, inclusiveness and the nature of its outcomes. In that context, some delegates noted the Working Group on 41/43 E/2015/31 E/CN.16/2015/4 Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum of the Commission, which provided recommendations in 2012 and the fact that many of those measures had been gradually implemented. A number of delegates called for the extension of the mandate of the Forum, and some hoped that it would be made permanent. 12. Other recent developments in Internet governance were also referred to during the discussion. In particular, activities within the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers were welcomed by some participants as an important new stage in Internet governance. 13. Some participants felt that there was still work to do in the area of Internet governance. One speaker called for a single, open, free and global Internet as being essential for harnessing the social and economic potential of the Internet. Some stressed the need to implement effective mechanisms with an enhanced role for Governments in international Internet governance. Several participants urged that differing views on Internet governance should not inhibit discussion on the ways to harness the positive impacts that the Internet could have on development. 14. Attention was also drawn to the secretariat’s work on the mapping of international Internet public policy issues. In that regard, some delegates stated that although the mapping exercise identified the existence of mechanisms that addressed international public policy issues pertaining to the Internet, it also acknowledged the absence of mechanisms for a wide range of international Internet public policy issues, as well as international legal frameworks to implement existing regulations. 15. The participants referred to a number of recent events and initiatives, including: the NETmundial Conference, held in Brazil in April 2014; the Conference of the UNESCO Internet Study, entitled “CONNECTing the dots: options for future action”, held in Paris in March 2015, and its report, which would be transmitted as an input to the overall review; the resolution entitled “Connect 2020 Agenda for Global Telecommunication/ICT Development”, adopted at the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference of 2014; and the ongoing efforts of action line facilitators to create a conceptual reference point for the sustainable development goals and the World Summit on the Information Society action lines. The World Summit Stocktaking Platform was also referred to in that context. 16. Participants stated that the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit was the responsibility of all stakeholders and described the efforts of United Nations agencies, Governments and other stakeholders to implement the objectives of the Summit within their areas of responsibility and capabilities. Several participants were of the view that the outcomes of the Summit had led to increased cooperation and dialogue between stakeholders, including Governments, the private sector, civil society entities and the academic and technical communities. That development was generally welcomed as a contributing factor towards enhancing the contribution of ICTs to development. Other speakers recognized that previous events on the 10-year review of the World Summit had been open and inclusive platforms, and noted that the overall review of the progress made in the implementation of the outcomes of the Summit should continue to take into account the contributions of all stakeholders. 42/43 E/2015/31 E/CN.16/2015/4 Ten-year review report 17. The report of the UNCTAD secretariat, Implementing World Summit on the Information Society Outcomes: A Ten-Year Review, was welcomed by most Governments and other stakeholders as a comprehensive, thorough and balanced analysis of developments in the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit, the evidence in which would provide a valuable resource to the Economic and Social Council and to the General Assembly. Many representatives welcomed the way in which the report drew on extensive submissions and contributions by United Nations agencies, Governments and other stakeholders, together with other evidence. Some participants stated that the report did not reflect sufficiently the view that little or no progress had been made in the area of enhanced cooperation. In particular, some delegates indicated that enhanced cooperation, as reflected in the Tunis Agenda, still remained an unfulfilled aspect and that it was necessary to identify ways to advance it in the post-2015 development agenda. 18. It was also suggested that there was a need for clear recommendations and focus on developing countries and their post-2015 needs. Some participants highlighted the need for prioritizing ICTs in international cooperation between developed and developing countries, in particular, least developed countries and landlocked developing countries. The importance of financing mechanisms was also particularly stressed. In that regard, some participants referred to the significant cost that investing in ICTs and their enabling structures constituted for developing countries. Some delegates expressed the need for recommendations on ways in which to enhance financing for the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit and to ensure that robust financial and technical assistance mechanisms were established to enable developing countries to fully implement ICTs so as to suitably address their development needs. They added that that aspect should be considered in the future of the World Summit. 19. Following the substantive discussion, the Commission decided to transmit the report through the Economic and Social Council to the General Assembly as an input to its overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society. That decision was reflected in the resolution on the assessment of the progress made in the implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society (see chap. I.A, resolution I). 20. Delegations were invited to provide, in writing, their observations made during the discussion.
