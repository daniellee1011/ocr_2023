Takes note of the reports of the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (E/CN.4/2004/47 and Add.1 and 2), and stresses that structural adjustment reform programmes have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Recognizes that the structural adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, imposing fixed expenditure ceilings, and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 3. Expresses its concern at the fact that the options for macroeconomic policy of developing countries are constrained by demands for adjustment and that many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still carry very high external debt burdens relative to their gross national product; 4. Also expresses its concern that the majority of countries that reached the intermediate phase under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debt Initiative have yet to reach the final stage and that even for countries meeting all the criteria, the Initiative may not result in a sustainable debt burden; 5. Recognizes that for the heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers in the forms of grants and concessional loans, as well as removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 6. Regrets that up till now there has been little headway made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor within them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms; 7. Acknowledges that a lot of progress remains to be achieved towards a lasting solution to the debt problems of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, and that in several low- and middle-income countries unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals regarding development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 8. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals set out in the Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 9. Recalls, once again, the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 10. Calls upon the international community, including the United Nations system, and the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the World Conference on Human Rights and the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, and in this regard stresses the need: 10. (a) To implement speedily, effectively, fully and with continued flexibility with respect to the eligibility criteria the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which should be fully financed through additional resources, taking into consideration, as appropriate, measures to address any fundamental changes in the economic circumstances of those developing countries that have an unsustainable debt burden caused by natural catastrophes, severe terms-of-trade shocks or conflict, taking into account initiatives which have been undertaken to reduce outstanding indebtedness; (b) To encourage exploring innovative mechanisms to comprehensively address the debt problems of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries and including middle-income countries and countries with economies in transition; 11. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration contained in the annex to resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 11. 12. Also recalls the conclusion of the statement on poverty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001, that some of the structural obstacles confronting developing States’ anti-poverty strategies lie beyond their control in the contemporary international order and that it is imperative that measures be taken urgently to remove these global structural obstacles, such as unsustainable foreign debt, the widening gap between rich and poor, and the absence of an equitable multilateral trade, investment and financial system; otherwise, the national anti-poverty strategies of some States have limited chance of sustainable 12. SUCCESS; 13. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven, with the participation of people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the national context, priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of 13. human rights; 14. Also stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 14. 15. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting the 15. ongoing programmes; 16. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 16. 17. Requests the independent expert to further explore, in his analytical annual report to the Commission, the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 17. 18. Also requests the independent expert, in the discharge of his mandate, to general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure that compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as provided for in the international human rights instruments, and to present a preliminary on this matter to the Commission at its sixty- first session and a final at the sixty-second session of the 18. Commission,; 19. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to carry out his functions; 19. 20. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 20. 21. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 21. 22. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 22. 23. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay particular attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 23. Decides to continue the consideration of this matter at its sixty-first session under 24. the same agenda item.",04/08/2004,2004_519295,Uganda,"22 April 2003, * In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council.",yes

organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and drugs at the national and international levels, as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes, such as murder, extortion, kidnapping, assault, the taking of hostages and robbery, Alarmed in particular at the possibility that the terrorist groups may exploit new technologies to facilitate acts of terrorism which may cause massive damage, including huge loss of human life, Mindful that the Security Council adopted resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001, requiring States to adopt counter-terrorism measures, and resolution 1377 (2001) of Convinced that terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed, can never be justified in any instance, including as a means to promote and protect human rights, Bearing in mind that the most essential and basic human right is the right to life, Bearing in mind also that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations creates an environment that destroys the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want, and makes it difficult for States to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, Bearing in mind further that terrorism in many cases poses a severe challenge to democracy, civil society and the rule of law, Alarmed by the unabated and continuing acts of terrorism in many parts of the world which have affected many civilians and which are also a threat to international peace and security, Reiterating that all States have an obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure effective implementation of their obligations under international humanitarian law, Profoundly disturbed by the large number of civilians killed, massacred and maimed by terrorists in indiscriminate and random acts of violence and terror, which cannot be justified under any circumstances, Emphasizing the need to intensify the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations at the national level and to enhance effective international cooperation in combating terrorism in conformity with international law, including relevant State obligations under international human rights and international humanitarian law, and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in this respect, Recognizing the need to improve international cooperation on criminal matters and national measures so as to address impunity, which can contribute to the continued occurrence of terrorism, Stressing the importance of a comprehensive approach to combat terrorism that addresses its current and mutating nature through timely information-sharing, early warning, appropriate law enforcement, strengthened policing, effective border control, prevention of terrorism financing and building capacity of States in these fields, Welcoming the launch of the Global Programme against Terrorism by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as a framework for its

international human rights standards and obligations, Seriously concerned at the gross violations of human rights perpetrated by terrorist groups, Stressing the growing consciousness of the international community of the negative effects of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and on the establishment of the rule of law and democratic freedoms as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the International Covenants on Human Rights, Noting the initiatives introduced since its previous session on the question of human rights and terrorism at the international, interregional and national levels, as shown by the commitment made by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries to fight terrorism, as expressed by the XIII Conference of the Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Kuala Lumpur in February 2003, Concerned by the tendencies to link terrorism and violence with religion, Bearing in mind the work of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on the issue of terrorism and in this context noting with concern that the reports of the Special Rapporteur on human rights and terrorism of the Sub-Commission have only been circulated in one language and not issued in all the official languages of the United Nations, in spite of the express request by the Sub-Commission, 1. Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, regardless of their motivation, in all their forms and manifestations, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed, as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening the territorial integrity and security of States, destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State; 2. Reaffirms that every person has a right to protection from terrorism and strongly condemns the violations of the right to life, liberty and security; Expresses its solidarity with the victims of terrorism and their families; Condemns incitement of ethnic hatred, violence and terrorism; 5. Welcomes the views expressed by the Secretary-General in his report to the General Assembly (A/58/533), considering that terrorism by itself is a violation of human rights; Rejects the identification of terrorism with any religion, nationality or culture; 7. Urges States to fulfil their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations in strict conformity with international law, including human rights standards and obligations and international humanitarian law, to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed, and calls upon States to strengthen, where appropriate, their legislation to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations; 8.

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1. Stresses that the proposal of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and, therefore, unacceptable; 11. 12. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office in Geneva; 12. 13. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 13. 14. Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 14. 15. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from non-represented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 15. 16. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 16. 17. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 17. 18. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 18. 19. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 19. 20. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 20. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 21. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of his mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 21. 22. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 22. Also requests the High Commissioner: 23. (a) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (b) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; () To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-first session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 24. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 25. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Right (JIU/REP/2003/6), in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 25. 26. Requests the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other intergovernmental bodies of the Organization regarding the management, programmes and 26. administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; Decides to consider this matter under the same agenda item at its 27. sixty-first session.
