Vohidov Permanent Representative of the Republic of Uzbekistan to the United Nations A/62/194 Annex I [Original: Russian] Explanatory memorandum 1. The Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) is an international institution for promoting development established by an Agreement between the Governments of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation of 12 January 2006. The Bank began its work on 27 June 2006. EDB is an international organization and a subject of international law; it has international legal capacity and can, in particular, conclude international agreements within the purview of its competence. Under the Agreement mentioned above, the Bank is guided in its activities by the generally recognized principles and norms of international law applicable under international agreements and also adheres to the generally recognized principles of banking. The Bank and its bodies are prohibited by its charter from participating in political activity. Other States and international organizations may accede to the Agreement on the establishment of EDB. 2. The Bank’s mission is to promote the development of the market economy, economic growth and the expansion of trade and economic ties through investment activities, including the financing of large-scale investment projects, in the Eurasian area. The Bank facilitates the strengthening of international financial and economic cooperation, by participating in the work of other international financial and banking organizations and associations. In the future, EDB is expected to become a consolidating element in the financial infrastructure of the single economic space and a partner of member countries in expanding integration processes and equalizing the levels of socio-economic development of the member States of the Eurasian Economic Community. 3. In order to achieve its objectives, the Bank carries out the following basic functions: «It engages in investment activities by financing projects and programmes, providing guarantees and contributing to the registered capital of organizations, using its own capital and funds obtained on international and national financial markets as well as other available resources for this purpose; ¢ It advises the members of the Bank on questions of economic development, the effective use of resources, and the expansion of trade and economic ties and conducts information and analysis activities in the field of State and international finance; ¢ It cooperates with international organizations, States, national institutions and the economic entities of the member States of the Bank and other countries interested in financing economic development. A/62/194 EDB investment activities aim to modernize the energy, transport, communication and agro-industrial infrastructure, achieve structural improvements in the economies of member States and increase the output of high-technology products with high added value in non-commodity sectors. 4. The Bank’s registered capital consists of US$ 1.5 billion. The Bank is located in the city of Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan. It is expected that, by the end of 2009, the value of the Bank’s investment project portfolio will exceed $3.5 billion and that of its assets will reach $5.5 billion. Accordingly, the Bank constitutes the largest integration project in our region in the financial and economic field. 5. We believe that powerful international institutions like the Eurasian Development Bank provide tangible assistance to socio-economic development and give further impetus to the processes of regional economic integration. Through its activities, the Bank is helping the countries in our region to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and is promoting their optimal inclusion in the world economy as full-fledged and advantageous partners. Thus, the activities of EDB as an international institution for promoting development are consonant with the purposes and principles of the United Nations in the socio-economic field. The Bank is one of the key regional partners of the United Nations system in our region. We are convinced that granting the Bank observer status in the General Assembly would help establish a firm basis for regular and well-organized cooperation between EDB and the United Nations in order to carry out the common and related tasks facing them.

Vohidov Permanent Representative of the Republic of Uzbekistan to the United Nations A/62/195 Annex I [Original: Russian] Explanatory memorandum The Treaty on the Establishment of the Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC) was signed on 10 October 2000 by the Presidents of the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tajikistan. The Republic of Uzbekistan joined the Community in 2006 at the same time as the Organization of Central Asian Cooperation became part of EURASEC. The Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine have the status of observer States in EURASEC. The Treaty on the Establishment of the Eurasian Economic Community affirms the commitment of the member States of the Community to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the generally recognized principles and norms of international law. The Community’s objectives are to: ¢ establish common regulations for trade in goods and services and their access to domestic markets, ¢ introduce a unified currency-regulation and currency-control procedure, ¢ draw up and implement joint programmes for socio-economic development, * create equal conditions for industrial and entrepreneurial activities, ¢ form a common transport-services market and a single transport system, ¢ form a common energy market, ¢ align closer and harmonize national legislation and also ensure cooperation among the legal systems of EURASEC States in order to establish a common legal space. The Inter-State Council, which is composed of the heads of State and Government of the Community countries, is the highest executive body of EURASEC. The Integration Committee is the Community’s standing administrative body. It is made up of the deputy heads of Government of the EURASEC countries. The Community Secretariat, located in Moscow (the Russian Federation) and Almaty (Kazakhstan), has the tasks of organizing and providing the information and A/62/195 technical support for the work of the Inter-State Council and the Integration Committee. The Secretariat is headed by the EURASEC Secretary-General, who is appointed by the Inter-State Council. Grigory Alekseevich Rapota has occupied this post since October 2001. The Commission of Permanent Representatives, who are appointed by the EURASEC heads of State, carries out the Community’s work during the intervals between meetings of the Integration Committee and ensures cooperation between the Community and the corresponding agencies, departments and organizations of the member countries. The EURASEC Inter-Parliamentary Assembly is made up of parliamentarians delegated by the parliaments of Community countries. It considers the questions of harmonizing (aligning, unifying) national legislation and bringing it into accordance with agreements concluded within the framework of EURASEC in order to achieve the Community’s objectives. The Community Court ensures the uniform implementation by the parties to the Treaty on the Establishment of the Eurasian Economic Community and the other agreements in force within the framework of the Community as well as decisions taken by its bodies and also considers economic disputes between EURASEC member States. The free trade regime is in operation in the territory of EURASEC without exception or restriction. At a meeting held in 2006 in Sochi, the Community heads of State adopted a decision on the formation of a customs union composed of the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. Other EURASEC countries will join the customs union when they are ready to do so. The formation of an economic and currency union is a long-term objective. A visa-free travel regime is in operation: citizens of EURASEC member States, in accordance with an intergovernmental agreement, have the right, regardless of their place of permanent residence, to enter, leave, pass through in transit, travel within or stay in the territory of EURASEC States without a visa. The near-term priority areas in EURASEC activities also include: ¢ Transport: the establishment of a single transport space, solving the problem of single rates, increasing the flow of goods, simplifying customs procedures, completion of internal State procedures under agreements signed and the creation of transnational transport and shipping firms; ¢ Energy: the joint exploitation of hydro-energy complexes in Central Asia and solving the problem of electrical energy supply and water use, achieving a single energy balance, construction of hydroelectric power stations (the question of building hydroelectric power stations in Kyrgyzia and Tajikistan is currently under consideration in practical terms); ¢ Labour migration: the social protection of migrants, the establishment of an effective system for regulating and controlling the migration of labour resources, combating the criminality that accompanies migration and solving problems related to the payment of taxes by migrants and employers; A/62/195 ¢ Agro-industrial complex: coordinating the agricultural policy of the EURASEC States, forming a single foodstuffs market of the Community countries, reducing expenditures on the transport, storage, and sale of agricultural products, and establishing new market institutions in this area (insurance, banking, leasing, stock market and other institutions). EURASEC has had observer status in the United Nations General Assembly since 2003. The Community cooperates closely with the United Nations system in most of the basic areas of its activities. Its main partners are the European Economic Commission (EEC) of the United Nations, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries is one of the most important areas of the Community’s cooperation with the United Nations. The prospects for joint work with the United Nations system in the environmental, humanitarian and migration fields also appear to hold much promise. A memorandum of understanding between EURASEC and UNDP was signed in September 2006 in order to strengthen the institutional framework for cooperation between the Community and United Nations structures. An agreement on cooperation between the EURASEC Inter-Parliamentary Assembly and the United Nations European Economic Commission was concluded on 25 January 2007. In this way, favourable initial conditions for mutually advantageous cooperation between the United Nations and EURASEC have been created.

(Signed) Byrganym Aitimova Ambassador Permanent Representative 07-52974 ni 091007 CARO AT A A A/62/232 Annex I Explanatory memorandum 1. The initiative for the convocation of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia was announced by the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, during the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly (1992). The main idea of the initiative is to create an effective structure for dialogue on security problems in Asia. Three basic aspects of the process’s activity are military-political measurement of security, economic cooperation, and interaction in humanitarian and human rights fields. 2. The Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA) is a structure uniting the countries of the Asian continent which sets before them the task of strengthening mutual cooperation between Asian States with a view to stabilizing and safeguarding the region. CICA plays a helpful role in advancing fruitful interaction and exchange, and in promoting conditions for stable economic growth. CICA is designed to promote peaceful settlement of disputes in the Asian continent, strengthen regional and global cooperation in combating terrorism, and promote tolerance and mutual understanding. 3. The first Summit of CICA was convened in 2002 in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Since then, the CICA process has gained momentum, with the elaboration of key principles and with various multilateral and bilateral initiatives in the security, economic, environmental and cultural spheres. At the Summit the Almaty Act and the CICA Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism and Promoting Dialogue among Civilizations were signed. 4. The participants in the Summit paid special attention to the fact that a new political process was being created, aimed at opening new possibilities for multilateral dialogue and equal interaction among the Asian countries in order to strengthen security and stability, creating an atmosphere of trust and cooperation. The leaders of the Asian countries elaborated new principles of security in Asia, based on trust, respect and cooperation. The Almaty Act and the CICA Declaration reflect these principles. 5. Adoption of the catalogue of CICA confidence-building measures, the CICA rules of procedure and the Declaration was a major result of the 2nd meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the CICA member States, held in October 2004. This is the first time in the history of the Asian continent that such a comprehensive document, providing multilateral cooperation on a broad spectrum of issues of stability and security, has appeared. 6. The second CICA Summit, held on 17 June 2006 in Almaty, adopted the Declaration of the second CICA Summit and signed the statute of the CICA secretariat. 7. The States members of CICA are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Palestine, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Uzbekistan (18). The observer States are Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Ukraine, United States of America, Viet Nam (6) and the observer organizations are the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the League of Arab States (3). 07-52974 A/62/232 8. The next steps in CICA activities will be aimed at continuing joint efforts to implement the confidence-building measures mentioned in the CICA catalogue, as well as elaborating a common approach to the new threats and challenges to security in Asia. 9. We believe that, in order to achieve a more effective, optimal level of cooperation and interaction between CICA and the United Nations, their mutual relations should in future be founded on a regular and well-organized basis. The granting of observer status for CICA in the General Assembly would serve this objective. Such an act would make it possible to strengthen in a concrete way coordination between CICA and the United Nations and expand their mutual capacities for promoting efforts to ensure peace, security and cooperation on a regional and global scale. 07-52974 A/62/232 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Noting the aspiration of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence- building Measures in Asia to enhance its cooperation with the United Nations, 1. Decides to invite the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia to participate in the sessions and work of the General Assembly in the capacity of observer; 2. Requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary action to implement the present resolution. 07-52974 A/62/232 Annex ITI Letter dated 4 September 2007 from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan to the Secretary-General The secretariat of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA) started functioning in Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan, in June 2006 by the decision of the second CICA Summit. This event marked the beginning of the new stage of the activities of CICA as a fully fledged international forum. I would like to use this opportunity to express our gratitude to the leadership of the United Nations that attended the ceremony of signing of the statute of the CICA secretariat. The main objective and thrust of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia is enhancing cooperation through elaborating multilateral approaches towards promoting peace, security and stability in Asia. Such principles as mutual trust, mutually beneficial cooperation, equality, harmony, respect for cultural diversity and aspiration to joint development have been taken as the basis for CICA activities. The goals that are pursued by CICA serve not only the common interests of its member States, but also correspond with modern global tendencies. In order to achieve the above objectives the member States are taking necessary steps to develop CICA as a forum for dialogue, consultation and adoption of decisions and measures on the basis of consensus on security issues in Asia. The Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia strictly abides by the goals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and stands for maintaining the prestige of the United Nations and its irreplaceable role in international affairs. The Conference is ready for various forms of dialogue, exchanges of opinion and cooperation with the United Nations and the specialized agencies on the issues of mutual interest as well as for joint work in promoting peace, security and development all over the world. By establishing CICA, the Heads of State and Government of the member States tasked CICA to deal with issues of common interest in economic, environmental, human and political-military dimensions as well as to tackle the new challenges and threats such as terrorism, illicit drug trafficking, human trafficking and money-laundering. One of the most important documents, entitled “Cooperative approach for the implementation of the CICA confidence-building measures”, which was approved by the Senior Officials Committee at the deputy ministerial level on 14 March 2007 in Bangkok, listing the areas of interest of the CICA member States, is attached for your kind consideration (see enclosure). In the light of the foregoing, I would like to inform you that, in a unanimous decision taken on 5 March 2007, 18 member States (Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Mongolia, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Palestine, Republic of Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey and Uzbekistan) agreed to apply to the United Nations for the inclusion of CICA in the list of non-Member States entities and organizations having a standing invitation to participate as an observer in the sessions and the work of the General Assembly. In this regard, Kazakhstan, as a Chairman of CICA, would like to request your kind support and 07-52974 A/62/232 assistance in resuming the internal procedure within the United Nations to that effect. I am confident that having received observer status in the General Assembly, the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia will take a more active part in international affairs, will widen its cooperation with the United Nations, non-CICA member countries, international and regional organizations and forums and make a contribution to maintaining regional and global peace and security and facilitating the growth of the region’s welfare. CICA will be working diligently in this direction.

A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 Annex Supplement to the World Programme of Action for Youth I. Globalization 1. Globalization has opened new opportunities for sustained economic growth and the development of the world economy. Globalization has also permitted countries to share experiences and to learn from one another’s achievements and difficulties and has promoted a cross-fertilization of ideas, cultural values and aspirations. Globalization has thus helped to connect youth not only to the rest of the world, but also with each other. 2. At the same time, the rapid processes of change and adjustment of globalization have been accompanied by intensified poverty, unemployment and social disintegration. Threats to human well-being, such as environmental risks, have also been globalized. Some countries have successfully adapted to the changes and benefited from globalization, but many others, especially least developed countries, have remained marginalized in the globalized world economy. The benefits are very unevenly shared, while the costs are unevenly distributed. Globalization should be fully inclusive and equitable. There is a strong need for appropriate policies and measures at the national and international levels to help countries respond effectively to the challenges of globalization and the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. 3. Many young people, especially in developing countries, remain marginalized from the global economy and lack the capabilities to access the opportunities that globalization offers. Many are restricted by inadequate education, limited skills, unemployment and poverty or are outside the reach of basic information and communication and the goods and services that have become available with globalization. Proposals for action Managing the effects of globalization on youth 4. The international community should continue to support the efforts of Governments, together with civil society, including youth-led organizations, the private sector and other parts of society, to anticipate and offset the negative social and economic consequences of globalization and to maximize its benefits for young people. 5. Governments should ensure that access of youth to technical, secondary and higher education is improved and that curricula are adapted to meet the needs of a rapidly changing labour market associated with globalization. The transition from learning to work should also be facilitated. 6. Governments should foster the conditions that provide opportunities, jobs and social services for youth in their home countries. Efforts should be made to guarantee that young migrants enjoy full respect for their human rights, including fair and equal treatment with others and the protection of law against, inter alia, violence, exploitation and discrimination such as racism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 and cultural intolerance, and access to economic opportunities and social services, as appropriate. Promoting youth employment and skills development in the context of globalization 7. In order to overcome the mismatch between the skills that youth possess and the specialized demands of labour markets shaped by _ globalization, Governments, with appropriate support from the international community, should provide funding and opportunities in both formal and non-formal education for youth to acquire requisite skills, including through skills development programmes. 8. At the same time, Governments should promote access to work through integrated policies that enable the creation of new and quality jobs for young people and that facilitate access to those jobs. Establishing ways of monitoring systems to track the effects of globalization on youth 9. Governments should assess the extent to which the benefits of globalization are accessible to youth and should design and implement programmes to enable youth to better harness the benefits of globalization. II. Information and communications technology 10. Information and communications technology (ICT) and infrastructures are growing in importance as a part of everyday business and interaction. This process can be enhanced by removing barriers to universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to information, which hinder the bridging of the digital divide, particularly those that impede the full achievement of the economic, social and cultural development of countries and the welfare of their people, especially youth, in particular in developing countries. ICT has enormous potential to expand access to quality education, to boost literacy and universal primary education and to facilitate the learning process itself, thus laying the groundwork for the establishment of a fully inclusive and development-oriented information society and knowledge economy that respects cultural and linguistic diversity. 11. Youth have a particular interest and ability with regard to modern technology. ICT can empower youth by providing them with the opportunity to overcome the barriers of distance and socio-economic disadvantage. Through the Internet, for example, young people can have access to information on a range of issues that directly affect them, including health, education and employment. This information can be used to improve the quality of life of youth and their communities. This process can be facilitated if Governments, civil society, the private sector, families, youth-led organizations and other groups work together to open up avenues for a cultural and social exchange among young people. Governments can also capitalize on the interest of the young in ICT to alleviate poverty. For example, youth can become engaged not only in the use of ICT, but also in the development and engineering of locally relevant software design and hardware. A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 12. ICT offers new ways to address the needs of youth with disabilities who cannot access traditional sources of information and employment. Vulnerable groups of the population can capitalize on ICT to make a better connection with society and advance their education and employment opportunities. Proposals for action Making information and communications technology available to all youth 13. Governments, supported by the international community, as appropriate, should facilitate access to ICT for all youth, including those in difficult-to-reach areas, such as rural areas, and in indigenous communities. Governments should evaluate inequalities in access that exist between urban and rural youth and between young women and men and should develop national strategies to overcome the “digital divide” in each country, thus decreasing the proportion of youth who have no access to ICT. 14. Governments should develop domestic policies to ensure that ICT is fully and appropriately integrated into education and training at all levels, including in the development of curricula, teacher training and institutional administration and management, as well as in support of the concept of lifelong learning. 15. Governments, with the support of the international community, should promote and encourage local knowledge systems, and locally produced content in media and communications, support the development of a wide range of ICT-based programmes in local languages, as appropriate, with content relevant to different groups of young persons, especially young women, and build the capacity of girls and women to develop ICT. Providing training to facilitate use of information and communications technology 16. Governments, in collaboration with relevant actors in the information society, should ensure that young people are equipped with knowledge and skills to use ICT appropriately, including the capacity to analyse and treat information in creative and innovative ways, to share their expertise and to participate fully in the information society. Efforts should be made to provide special training courses for in-school and out-of-school youth to enable them to become conversant with ICT and to facilitate their use of such technologies. Protecting youth from the harmful aspects of information and communications technology 17. Governments should strengthen action to protect youth from abuse and to defend their rights in the context of the use of ICT. In that context, the best interests of youth are a primary consideration. Governments should promote responsible behaviour and raise awareness of possible risks for young people arising from the harmful aspects of ICT in order that they may protect themselves from possible exploitation and injury. 18. Governments, in cooperation with relevant actors of information society, should strengthen action to protect children and youth from abuse and the harmful impact of ICT, in particular through cybercrimes, including child pornography. A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 Promoting the use of information and communications technology by persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups 19. Governments should facilitate the development of ICT capacity for youth, including indigenous youth, youth with disabilities and youth in remote and rural communities. 20. Governments should initiate the development and use of special technical and legal arrangements to make ICT accessible to all youth, including indigenous youth, youth with disabilities and youth in remote and rural communities. Empowering young people as key contributors to building an inclusive information society 21. Governments should actively engage youth in innovative ICT-based development programmes and should widen opportunities for youth involvement in e-strategy processes in a manner that encourages youth to assume leadership roles. The role of youth in creating, repairing, managing and maintaining ICT should also be recognized and encouraged. 22. Bearing in mind that literacy and numeracy are preconditions for access to and effective use of ICT, Governments should promote opportunities through formal and non-formal channels for young persons to acquire the appropriate knowledge. 23. ICT should also be used to enhance education, employment and youth participation in the decision-making process. ICT should be used to improve the quality of education and to better prepare youth for the demands of the information society. II. HIV/AIDS 24. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is increasingly a problem of youth, especially in parts of the developing world. Governments have noted with grave concern the fact that new HIV infections are heavily concentrated among youth and that there is a lack of information available to help youth understand their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, in order to increase their ability to protect themselves from HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases and to prevent unwanted pregnancies. 25. Young people, especially young women in Africa, face especially high risks of HIV infection. Young people and women are particularly vulnerable to infection owing to their lack of economic and social power and their lack of the capability to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality in order to increase their ability to protect themselves from HIV infections. They often lack the tools and information required to avoid infection and cope with AIDS. In 2006, women and girls made up 57 per cent of all people infected with HIV in sub- Saharan Africa, where a striking 76 per cent of young people (aged 15-24) living with HIV are female. 26. Although many children orphaned by AIDS have not yet entered the youth age groups, they are at great risk of becoming youth with severe vulnerabilities. They are subject to malnutrition, illness, abuse, child labour and 10 sexual exploitation, and these factors increase their vulnerability to HIV infection. They also suffer the stigma and discrimination often associated with HIV/AIDS and may be denied education, work, housing and other basic needs as a result. 27. It is imperative that young people continue to have access to evidence- and skills-based youth-specific HIV education to enable them to avoid high-risk behaviour. In some regions youth, especially girls, play a key role in caring for HIV/AIDS patients or their orphans. To ensure that young caregivers stay in school, build their skills and have the chance to generate an income, Governments should provide economic and social support to families that rely on young caregivers as well as support for improving home- and community-based care. 28. Because youth often lack decision-making power and financial resources, they may be the last to receive treatment if they become infected. Programmes should scale up the provision of treatment as part of the promotion of the highest attainable standards of health. 29. It is essential for Governments to implement fully the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session in 2001,! and to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. In addition, Governments should implement the commitments dealing with HIV/AIDS reached at all major United Nations conferences and summits, including the 2005 World Summit and the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS held on 2 June 2006,2 at which Member States committed themselves to scaling up responses directed towards achieving the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010 and towards achieving the goal of universal access to reproductive health by 2015, as set out at the International Conference on Population and Development. Proposals for action Raising awareness about HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment for youth 30. Governments should ensure that prevention of HIV infection is the mainstay of national, regional and international responses to the pandemic and should therefore commit themselves to intensifying efforts to ensure that a wide range of prevention programmes, which take into account local circumstances, ethics and cultural values, are available in all countries, in particular the most affected countries, including: information, education and communications, in languages most understood within communities and with respect for their cultures, aimed at reducing risk-taking behaviours and encouraging responsible sexual behaviour, including abstinence and fidelity; expanded access to essential commodities, including male and female condoms and sterile injecting equipment; harm-reduction efforts related to drug use; expanded access to voluntary and confidential counselling and testing; safe blood supplies; and early and effective treatment of sexually transmitted infections. 1 Resolution S-26/2, annex. 2 See resolution 60/262, annex. 11 31. Governments should commit themselves to addressing the rising rates of HIV infection among young people in order to ensure that future generations may be free of HIV infection through the implementation of comprehensive evidence-based prevention strategies, responsible sexual behaviour, including the use of condoms, evidence- and skills-based youth-specific HIV education, mass media interventions and the provision of youth-friendly health services. 32. Governments should provide access to the highest attainable standards of affordable and youth-friendly health care in order to increase the capacities of young people to protect themselves from the risk of HIV infection, principally through the provision of health care and health services, including for sexual and reproductive health, in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development,? that integrate HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care and include confidential voluntary counselling and testing and involve young people in the planning, implementation and evaluation of those efforts. 33. Governments should promote initiatives aimed at reducing the prices of antiretroviral drugs, especially second-line drugs, available to young people, including initiatives undertaken on a voluntary basis by groups of Member States based on innovative financing mechanisms that contribute to the mobilization of resources for social development, including those that aim to provide further drug access at affordable prices to developing countries on a sustainable and predictable basis. 34. In recognition of the fact that HIV/AIDS is increasingly affecting youth in both developed and developing countries, all efforts should be made, in full partnership with young persons, parents, families, educators and health-care providers, to ensure that youth have access to accurate information, education, including peer education and youth-specific HIV education, and services necessary to develop the life skills required to reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection. 35. Governments should involve young people, including youth living with HIV/AIDS, inter alia, through their respective youth organizations and, as appropriate, with the support of their families, in the decision-making, planning, implementation and evaluation of HIV/AIDS prevention and care programmes. 36. Governments should ensure that prevention programmes include counselling for those who are infected with HIV in order to ensure that they take appropriate precautions to prevent the spread of the virus and to help them cope with the effects of living with HIV/AIDS. Supporting universal HIV/AIDS education, taking gender inequalities into account 37. Trafficking of women and girls for prostitution and sexual slavery increases the vulnerability of young women to HIV/AIDS infection and is linked to the widespread feminization of poverty, sex tourism, sweatshops and other detrimental consequences of globalization. Governments should devise, enforce and strengthen effective youth-sensitive measures to combat, eliminate and prosecute all forms of trafficking in women and girls, including for sexual and economic 3 Report of the International Conference on Population and Development, Cairo, 5-13 September 1994 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.95.XIII.18), chap. I, resolution 1, annex. 12 exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy within wider efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. 38. Governments should include appropriate information in school curricula and non-formal training programmes on the effects of high-risk behaviour, including intravenous drug use, on the transmission of HIV infection. 39. Governments should give special attention, in all programmes aimed at providing information about and preventing HIV/AIDS among youth, to aspects of gender and to the disproportionate vulnerability of girls and young women. Legislation and legal instruments to protect vulnerable youth 40. Governments should ensure non-discrimination and full and equal enjoyment of all human rights through the promotion of an active and visible policy of destigmatization of children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. 41. Governments should strengthen legal, policy, administrative and other measures for the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of all human rights by youth, the protection of their dignity and the reduction of their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS through the elimination of all forms of discrimination and all types of sexual exploitation of young girls and boys, including for commercial reasons, as well as all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful traditional and customary practices, abuse, rape and other forms of sexual violence, battering and trafficking in women and girls. 42. Governments should intensify efforts to enact, strengthen or enforce, as appropriate, legislation, regulations and other measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by youth living with HIV, including policies to secure their access to education, inheritance, employment, health care, social and health services, prevention, support and treatment, information and legal protection, while respecting their privacy and confidentiality and developing strategies to combat the stigma and social exclusion connected with the epidemic. IV. Armed conflict 43. Development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. The scale of the violence perpetrated against civilians, including youth, in the past couple of decades is extremely worrisome. Armed conflicts have resulted in killings, the massive displacement of people, including youth, and the destruction of communities, which has impacted negatively on their development. 44. Youth are often among the main victims of armed conflict. Children and youth are killed or maimed, made orphans, abducted, taken hostage, forcibly displaced, deprived of education and health care and left with deep emotional scars and trauma. Children illegally recruited as child soldiers are often forced to commit serious abuses. Armed conflict destroys the safe environment provided by a house, a family, adequate nutrition, education and employment. During conflict, health risks increase among youth, especially young women. Young women and girls face additional risks, in particular those of sexual violence and exploitation. 13 45. During conflict, young men and women who are forced to take on “adult” roles miss out on opportunities for personal or professional development. When conflict ends, many of the young people who must make the transition to adulthood while dealing with the traumas of war are at the same time required to adapt quickly to their new roles, often as parents and caretakers of the victims of war. Without services to help them deal with their situation, youth and young adults may fail to integrate into society. Proposals for action Protecting youth under age 18 from direct involvement in armed conflict 46. Governments should ensure that children benefit from an early age from education about values, attitudes, modes of behaviour and ways of life in order to enable them to resolve any dispute peacefully and in a spirit of respect for human dignity, with tolerance and non-discrimination. Governments should promote a culture of peace, tolerance and dialogue, including in both formal and non-formal education. 47. Governments should consider, as a matter of priority, the ratification and effective implementation of the Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour 1999 (Convention No. 182) of the International Labour Organization. 48. Governments should take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take direct part in hostilities and that those who have not attained the age of 18 years are not compulsorily recruited into their armed forces. 49. Governments should take all necessary measures, in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law, as a matter of priority, to prevent the recruitment and use of children by armed groups, as distinct from the armed forces of a State, including the adoption of policies that do not tolerate the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, and the legal measures necessary to prohibit and criminalize such practices. 50. Governments should protect young persons in situations of armed conflict, post-conflict settings and settings involving refugees and internally displaced persons, where youth are at risk of violence and where their ability to seek and receive redress is often restricted, bearing in mind that peace is inextricably linked with equality between young women and young men and development, that armed and other types of conflicts and terrorism and hostage-taking still persist in many parts of the world, and that aggression, foreign occupation and ethnic and other types of conflicts are an ongoing reality affecting young persons in nearly every region from which they need to be protected. Providing for the reintegration of youth ex-combatants and protection of non-combatants 51. Governments should provide opportunities for all youth who have been engaged in active combat, whether voluntarily or by force, to demobilize and contribute to society’s development if they seek to do so. In this regard, Governments should establish programmes to provide opportunities for youth 14 ex-combatants to retool and retrain so as to facilitate their employment in economic activity and their reintegration into society, including family reunification. 52. Governments should take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children and young victims of armed conflicts, in particular by restoring access of those children and youth to health care and education, including through “Education for All” programmes, as well as to put in place effective youth employment strategies to help provide a decent living for young people and to facilitate their reintegration into society. Promoting active involvement of youth in maintaining peace and security 53. Governments should encourage the involvement of young people, where appropriate, in activities concerning the protection of children and youth affected by armed conflict, including programmes for reconciliation, peace consolidation and peacebuilding. V. Intergenerational issues 54. Many aspects of the demographic transition, global economic development and_ globalization have influenced opportunities for the intergenerational exchange of knowledge, ideas and resources. The increase in lifespan implies that many adults may be able to share knowledge and resources with younger generations over a longer period of time. In recent times, greater longevity has resulted in situations where many older people live for longer periods in some form of dependency on younger generations. On the other hand, trends in globalization and development have resulted in situations where many young people are cut off from their families. In many developing countries and countries with economies in transition, it is the ageing population that is dominant in rural areas owing to the exodus of young adults. Older persons may be left behind without the traditional support of families and even without adequate financial resources. While older persons lose opportunities to receive support from younger members of families, younger persons also lose opportunities to benefit from the knowledge and guidance of older members of their families. 55. At the family and community levels, intergenerational ties can be valuable for everyone. Individual and family choices, geographical mobility and the pressures of contemporary life can keep people apart, yet the great majority of people in all cultures maintain close relations with their families throughout their lives. These relationships work in both directions, with older persons often providing significant contributions financially, emotionally and in respect of the education and care of grandchildren and other kin, thereby making a crucial contribution to the stability of the family unit. 56. The weakening of intergenerational connections in the context of ageing societies implies that various needs of youth, children and older persons, which may have been supported through intricate and complex familial relationships, are increasingly not being met and are instead becoming the responsibility of the State or the private sector. 57. It is therefore incumbent on Governments and relevant sectors of society to develop programmes that renew or restore intergenerational solidarity. Where there has already been substantial erosion of the ability of communities to meet this 15 objective, Governments should intervene to ensure that basic needs for protection are met. Proposals for action Strengthening families 58. While respecting individual preferences for living arrangements, all sectors of society, including Governments, should develop programmes to strengthen families and to foster intergenerational relations. Empowering young women 59. Governments should promote greater participation by young women in the labour force, including those living in rural and remote areas, by providing and developing the necessary skills to enable them to find employment, especially through taking measures to eliminate male and female stereotypes and through promoting role models, and to facilitate better reconciliation of work and family life. Strengthening intergenerational solidarity 60. Government and private sector businesses should capitalize on the opportunity to use the experience and skills of older workers to train younger and newer employees. 61. Governments should promote equality and _ solidarity between generations, including by offering young people full and effective participation in poverty eradication, employment creation and social integration programmes within their societies. 62. All sectors of society should be encouraged to develop reciprocity in learning, which provides older persons with opportunities to learn from younger generations. 63. Where traditional forms of social support have been reduced by migration, globalization and related situations, Governments should work with non- governmental organizations and the private sector to provide assistance and support to older caregivers, especially those providing care for HIV/AIDS orphans, in meeting the needs of their children and grandchildren. 64. Governments should take steps to strengthen solidarity among generations and intergenerational partnerships through the promotion of activities that support intergenerational communication and understanding, and should encourage mutually responsive relationships between generations. 65. The full and effective participation of young people and youth organizations at the local, national, regional and international levels is important for the realization of the Millennium Development Goals, the promotion and implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth, and the evaluation of the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation, and for support of the activities of mechanisms that have been set up by young people and youth organizations. Governments should encourage their participation in actions and decisions and in strengthening efforts to implement the World Programme of Action, bearing in mind that girls, boys, young women and young men have the same rights, but different needs and strengths, and that they are active agents in decision-making processes and for positive change and development in society. 07-60110 16",11/15/2007,2007_612309,Kazakhstan,N/A,yes

Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;4 2. Notes with appreciation that a growing network of Governments, organizations, major groups and individuals around the world recognize the importance of the sustainable development of mountain regions for poverty eradication, and recognizes the global importance of mountains as the source of most of the Earth’s freshwater, as repositories of rich biological diversity and other natural resources, including timber and minerals, as providers of some sources of renewable energy, as popular destinations for recreation and tourism and as areas of important cultural diversity, knowledge and heritage, all of which generate positive, unaccounted economic benefits; 3. | Recognizes that mountains provide indications of global climate change through phenomena such as modifications of biological diversity, the retreat of mountain glaciers and changes in seasonal runoff that may impact major sources of freshwater in the world, and stresses the need to undertake actions to minimize the negative effects of these phenomena; 4. Recognizes that sustainable mountain development is a key component in achieving the Millennium Development Goals in many regions of the world; 5. Notes with concern that there remain key challenges to achieving sustainable development, eradicating poverty in mountain regions and protecting mountain ecosystems, and that populations in mountain regions are frequently among the poorest in a given country; 6. Encourages Governments to adopt a long-term vision and _ holistic approaches in their sustainable development strategies, and to promote integrated approaches to policies related to sustainable development in mountain regions; 7. Also encourages Governments to integrate mountain sustainable development in national, regional and global policymaking and development strategies, including through incorporating mountain-specific requirements in sustainable development policies or through specific mountain policies; 8. Notes that the growing demand for natural resources, including water, the consequences of erosion, deforestation and other forms of watershed degradation, A/C.2/62/L.18/Rev.1 the occurrence of natural disasters, as well as increasing out-migration, the pressures of industry, transport, tourism, mining, agriculture and the consequences of global climate change are some of the key challenges in fragile mountain ecosystems to implementing sustainable development and eradicating poverty in mountain regions, consistent with the Millennium Development Goals; 9. Underlines the importance of sustainable forest management, the avoidance of deforestation, as well as the restoration of lost and degraded forest ecosystems of mountains in order to enhance the role of mountains as natural carbon and water regulators; 10. Notes that sustainable agriculture in mountain regions is important for the protection of the mountain environment and the promotion of the regional economy; 11. Expresses its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in mountain regions, especially those in developing countries, and urges the international community to take concrete steps to support national and regional efforts to ensure the sustainable development of mountains; 12. Encourages Governments, the international community and other relevant stakeholders to improve the awareness, preparedness and infrastructure to cope with the increasing impact of disasters in mountain regions, such as flash floods, including glacial lake outburst floods, as well as landslides, debris flow and earthquakes; 13. Encourages Governments, with the collaboration of the scientific community, mountain communities and intergovernmental organizations, where appropriate, to study, with a view to promoting sustainable mountain development, the specific concerns of mountain communities, including the effects of global climate change on mountain environments and biological diversity, in order to elaborate sustainable adaptation strategies to cope with the adverse effects of climate change; 14. Underlines the fact that action at the national level is a key factor in achieving progress in sustainable mountain development, welcomes its steady increase in recent years with a multitude of events, activities and initiatives, and invites the international community to support the efforts of developing countries to develop and implement strategies and programmes, including, where required, enabling policies and laws for the sustainable development of mountains, within the framework of national development plans; 15.

Notes that funding for sustainable mountain development has become increasingly important, especially in view of the greater recognition of the global importance of mountains and the high level of extreme poverty, food insecurity and hardship facing mountain communities; 23. Invites Governments, the United Nations system, the international financial institutions, the Global Environment Facility, all relevant United Nations conventions and their funding mechanisms, within their respective mandates, and all relevant stakeholders from civil society and the private sector to consider providing support, including through voluntary financial contributions, to local, national and international programmes and projects for sustainable development in mountain regions, particularly in developing countries; 24. Underlines the importance for sustainable development in mountains of exploring a wide range of funding sources, such as public-private partnerships, increased opportunities for microfinance, including microcredit and microinsurance, small housing loans, savings, education and health accounts, and support for entrepreneurs seeking to develop small and medium-sized businesses and, where appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, debt for sustainable development swaps; 25. Notes that public awareness needs to be raised with respect to the positive and unaccounted economic benefits that mountains provide, and underlines the importance of enhancing the sustainability of ecosystems that provide essential resources and services for human well-being and economic activity and of developing innovative means of financing for their protection; 26. Notes with satisfaction the adoption by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity of a programme of work on mountain A/C.2/62/L.18/Rev.1 biological diversity, the overall purpose of which is the significant reduction of the loss of mountain biological diversity by 2010 at the global, regional and national levels, and its implementation, which aims at making a significant contribution to poverty eradication in mountain regions; 27. Recognizes that mountain ranges are usually shared among several countries, and in this context encourages transboundary cooperation approaches, where the States concerned agree, to the sustainable development of mountain ranges and information-sharing in this regard; 28. Notes with appreciation, in this context, the Convention on the Protection of the Alps,® which promotes constructive new approaches to integrated, sustainable development of the Alps, including through its thematic protocols on spatial planning, mountain farming, conservation of nature and landscape, mountain forests, tourism, soil protection, energy and transport, as well as the Declaration on Population and Culture; 29. Also notes with appreciation the Framework Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians,” adopted and signed by the seven countries of the region to provide a framework for cooperation and multisectoral policy coordination, a platform for joint strategies for sustainable development and a forum for dialogue between all involved stakeholders; 30.
