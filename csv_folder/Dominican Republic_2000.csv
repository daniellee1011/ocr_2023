incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, Particularly alarmed at the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as an institutionalized governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial

spreading and that racism is taking increasingly violent forms, Stressing the need to recognize that acts of violence motivated by racial discrimination and xenophobia are crimes punishable by law,
