The focal point will perform the following tasks: 1. Receive de-listing requests from a petitioner (individual(s), groups, undertakings, and/or entities on the Sanctions Committee’s lists). 2. Verify if the request is new or is a repeated request. 3. Ifit is a repeated request and if it does not contain any additional information, return it to the petitioner. 4.
