E/CN.15/2006/L.2 Annex I Information-gathering instrument on United Nations standards and norms related primarily to the prevention of crime Pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 2004/28 of 21 July 2004, the following questionnaire is designed as a tool to collect information to assist in the preparation of the report of the Secretary-General, in particular as regards the following: (a) The difficulties encountered in the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention; (b) Ways in which technical assistance can be provided; and (c¢) Useful practices and emerging challenges. It is not intended to produce a scorecard of how well States are doing. It addresses the main sections of the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime (Council resolution 2002/13, annex) and, as the case may be, other relevant instruments. Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13 of 24 July 2003 on action to promote effective crime prevention accepted the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime and also requested the Secretary-General to report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on the implementation of that resolution. In the Guidelines, crime prevention refers to “strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring” by influencing “their multiple causes” (para. 3). It includes social crime prevention (or prevention through social development), local, community or neighbourhood-based crime prevention, situational crime prevention and measures to prevent recidivism. The definition does not include law enforcement and other criminal justice intervention, even though these may have crime prevention aspects. It is cognizant, however, of the need to take account of “the growing internationalization of criminal activities” (para. 4). When referring to the community, it refers in essence to “the involvement of civil society at the local level” (para. 5). Other instruments relevant to the prevention of crime include: e Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/9 of 24 July 1995, the annex to which contains the Guidelines for cooperation and technical assistance in the field of urban crime prevention e General Assembly resolution 51/60 of 12 December 1996, the annex to which contains the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security The questionnaire is divided into five sections: governmental structure for crime prevention; areas of crime prevention; implementation issues; international cooperation and networking; and concluding questions. In developing the questionnaire, related paragraphs have been grouped for simplicity and clarity. E/CN.15/2006/L.2 I.

Annex Information-gathering instrument on United Nations standards and norms related primarily to the prevention of crime Pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 2004/28 of 21 July 2004, the following questionnaire is designed as a tool to collect information to assist in the preparation of the report of the Secretary-General, in particular as regards the following: (a) The difficulties encountered in the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention; 4 This language does not provide a basis for an increase in the regular budget or requests for supplemental increases. E/CN.15/2006/L.2/Rev.2 (b) Ways in which technical assistance can be provided; and (c¢) Useful practices and emerging challenges. It is not intended to produce a scorecard of how well States are doing. It addresses the main sections of the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime (Council resolution 2002/13, annex) and, as the case may be, other relevant instruments. Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13 of 24 July 2003 on action to promote effective crime prevention accepted the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime and also requested the Secretary-General to report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on the implementation of that resolution. In the Guidelines, crime prevention refers to “strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring” by influencing “their multiple causes” (para. 3). It includes social crime prevention (or prevention through social development), local, community or neighbourhood-based crime prevention, situational crime prevention and measures to prevent recidivism. The definition does not include law enforcement and other criminal justice intervention, even though these may have crime prevention aspects. It is cognizant, however, of the need to take account of “the growing internationalization of criminal activities” (para. 4). When referring to the community, it refers in essence to “the involvement of civil society at the local level” (para. 5). Other instruments relevant to the prevention of crime include: e Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/9 of 24 July 1995, the annex to which contains the Guidelines for cooperation and technical assistance in the field of urban crime prevention e General Assembly resolution 51/60 of 12 December 1996, the annex to which contains the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security The questionnaire is divided into five sections: structuring crime prevention at the governmental level; crime prevention approaches; implementation issues; international cooperation, networking and technical assistance; and concluding questions. In developing the questionnaire, related paragraphs have been grouped for simplicity and clarity. I.

Government leadership 7. All levels of government should play a leadership role in developing effective and humane crime prevention strategies and in creating and maintaining institutional frameworks for their implementation and review. Cooperation/partnerships 9. Cooperation/partnerships should be an integral part of effective crime prevention, given the wide-ranging nature of the causes of crime and the skills and responsibilities required to address them. This includes partnerships working across ministries and between authorities, community organizations, non-governmental organizations, the business sector and private citizens. Government structures 17. Governments should include prevention as a permanent part of their structures and programmes for controlling crime, ensuring that clear responsibilities and goals exist within government for the organization of crime prevention, by, inter alia: (a) Establishing centres or focal points with expertise and resources; (b) Establishing a crime prevention plan with clear priorities and targets; (¢) Establishing linkages and coordination between relevant government agencies or departments; (d) Fostering partnerships with non-governmental organizations, the business, private and professional sectors and the community, (e) Seeking the active participation of the public in crime prevention by informing it of the need for and means of action and its role.

It is not intended to produce a scorecard of how well States are doing. It addresses the main sections of the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime (Council resolution 2002/13, annex) and, as the case may be, other relevant instruments. Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13 of 24 July 2003 on action to promote effective crime prevention accepted the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime and also requested the Secretary-General to report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on the implementation of that resolution. In the Guidelines, crime prevention refers to “strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring” by influencing “their multiple causes” (para. 3). It includes social crime prevention (or prevention through social development), local, community or neighbourhood-based crime prevention, situational crime prevention and measures to prevent recidivism. The definition does not include law enforcement and other criminal justice intervention, even though these may have crime prevention aspects. It is cognizant, however, of the need to take account of “the growing internationalization of criminal activities” (para. 4). When referring to the community, it refers in essence to “the involvement of civil society at the local level” (para. 5). E/CN.15/2006/L.2/Rev.1 Other instruments relevant to the prevention of crime include: e Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/9 of 24 July 1995, the annex to which contains the Guidelines for cooperation and technical assistance in the field of urban crime prevention e General Assembly resolution 51/60 of 12 December 1996, the annex to which contains the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security The questionnaire is divided into five sections: structuring crime prevention at the governmental level; crime prevention approaches; implementation issues; international cooperation, networking and technical assistance; and concluding questions. In developing the questionnaire, related paragraphs have been grouped for simplicity and clarity. I.
