brought to justice, while recognizing that in conflict and in post conflict situations national justice systems may be significantly weakened, Reaffirming that ending impunity is essential if a society in conflict or recovering from conflict is to come to terms with past abuses committed against civilians affected by armed conflict and to prevent future such abuses, drawing attention to the

forces, thereby helping to build a security sector that is accessible and responsive to all, especially women, Welcoming the efforts of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop gender
