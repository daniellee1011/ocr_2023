Framework Convention on Climate Change, in which they acknowledged in the preamble that they should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations with regard to human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, the empowerment of women and intergenerational equity, Noting the Secretary-General’s Call to Action for Human Rights, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders

patterns of discrimination, and that environmental harm can have disastrous and at times geographically dispersed consequences for the quality of life of indigenous peoples, local communities, peasants and others who rely directly on the products of forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans for their food, fuel and medicine, resulting in further inequality and marginalization, Recognizing also that sustainable development and the protection of the environment, including ecosystems, contribute to human well-being and to the enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, to the

recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Climate Change and Land, Recognizing the benefits of seeking to mitigate and minimize the negative effects of pollution and other forms of environmental degradation in situations of armed conflict and A/HRC/46/L.6/Rev.1 post-conflict contexts, and expressing its deep concern at the threats posed to the effective enjoyment of human rights by persons in vulnerable situations, including children, women and girls, youth, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous peoples, local communities,

resolution 40/11 of 21 March 2019, in which the Council recognized the contribution of human rights defenders working in environmental matters, referred to as environmental human rights defenders, to

safeguarding the environment, Recognizing further the particular vulnerability of children to the effects of environmental harm, including to air pollution, water pollution, climate change, exposure to chemicals, toxic substances and waste, and loss of biodiversity, and that environmental harm may interfere with the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, Mindful that the growing risk of emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin may be caused by human actions that damage ecosystems and biodiversity, stressing that biodiversity is important for the enjoyment of a wide range of human rights, and expressing concern that the loss of biodiversity caused by human activities can be threatening to the enjoyment of those rights and have a major impact on health and livelihoods, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and promote human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental challenges, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, as recognized in different international instruments and reflected in the framework principles on human rights and the environment,? and that additional measures for those

accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 16, and taking into account the commitment to leave no one behind, Acknowledging the important role played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities, including women and girls with disabilities of African and Asian descent, are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Condemning the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and recognizing the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as facing barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, Stressing that States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent health-care services, maternal health-care services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HI'V and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services can violate, abuse or impair the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Recognizing that information and communications technologies, including assistive technology and devices, have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can create conditions enabling the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and can contribute to their social and digital inclusion and digital literacy, empowerment and autonomy, and allow them to live independently on an equal basis with others and to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in society and in the world of work, while condemning all forms of violence against women and girls with disabilities in digital contexts, including new forms of violence such as cyberviolence, bullying and harassment, and their rising prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic, Recognizing also the major contribution made by civil society, including women’s and girls’ rights and community-based organizations, organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, older women, girls and youth, feminist groups, women and girl human rights defenders and disability inclusion advocates, and recognizing further the importance of having open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment and domestic violence, by, A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 inter alia, providing for a supportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, including by raising awareness about the human rights of all women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing further that domestic violence is not a private family matter and must be eliminated, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, 1. Expresses outrage at the persistence and pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide; 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms all forms of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in the context of lockdown measures and school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 3. Expresses deep concern that all forms of discrimination and violence impair or nullify the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which hinders the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others in the economic, social, cultural, civil and political spheres, and is an impediment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 4. Stresses the need to strengthen efforts to empower women and girls with disabilities and enhance their participation and promote their leadership in society by taking measures to address all barriers that prevent or restrict their full and equal participation and inclusion in all spheres of life, including through the creation of enabling programmes, community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes, ensure their access, on an equal basis with others, to economic and financial resources and disability-inclusive and accessible social infrastructure, transportation, justice mechanisms and services, in particular in relation to health and education, as well as productive employment and decent work for women with disabilities, and ensure that the priorities and rights of women and girls with disabilities are fully incorporated into policies and programmes and that they are closely consulted and actively involved in decision-making processes; 5. Also stresses the need to address multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, which place women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, violence and abuse, and to implement measures to prevent and eliminate stereotypes based on disability, gender, age, race and xenophobia, ableism, stigma, negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that cause or perpetuate discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Recognizes that a proactive multisectoral approach, working with all relevant stakeholders, including organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, is required to prevent, respond to and eliminate violence against women and girls with disabilities, including lifelong education, training and media campaigns that promote respect, dignity, accountability, equality, non-discrimination, inclusion and accessibility, as well as full and effective participation in political and public life and economic empowerment, social protection measures aimed at reducing poverty and financial dependence on other persons and measures aimed at deinstitutionalization and promotion of independent living; 7. Calls upon States to take immediate and effective action to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by: (a) Fostering respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, promoting empowering portrayals of women and girls with disabilities and awareness-raising campaigns of their capabilities and contributions, and refraining from supporting or funding campaigns that perpetuate stigmatization or stereotyping of women and girls with disabilities; (b) Reviewing laws and policies that perpetuate the outdated understanding of disability present in charity and medical models and ableism, and incorporating a human rights-based approach to disability;

(d) Implementing and allocating adequate resources towards effective and evidence-based programmes and strategies with and for women and girls with disabilities, such as increasing access to assistive devices and technologies and community-based habilitation and rehabilitation services adapted to their requirements, in compliance with States’ international human rights obligations; (e) Ensuring the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls, in their diverse contexts, including women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the development and implementation of accessible and inclusive national policies, legislation, procedures, action plans, programmes, projects and strategies to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls, and ensuring that such participation is conducted in a safe and accessible environment, including through support and capacity-building from organizations of and led by women, girls and other persons with disabilities, and through community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes for women and girls with disabilities; €3] Ensuring that services and programmes designed to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls are inclusive of and accessible to women and girls with disabilities, including by ensuring that facilities, services and information are accessible and by providing age- and gender-responsive, disability-inclusive and trauma-informed education and training to professionals, paid care workers and unpaid caregivers working to address the specific requirements of women with disabilities, including older women, and girls with disabilities; (g) Ensuring that social protection systems address the multiple, interrelated and complex causes of homelessness by preventing poverty, contributing to independent living in the community, health-related goals, gender and racial equality and decent work, and facilitating the inclusion of persons with disabilities; (h) Taking all appropriate measures to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, with particular attention to the risks faced by and the specific requirements of women and girls with disabilities; 1) Developing and implementing educational programmes and teaching materials in accessible, affordable and alternative formats of communication, including easy to read and understand formats, that raise educators’ and learners’ awareness about violence against women and girls, including through evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education, consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, that explains consent, respect for boundaries, what constitutes unacceptable behaviour and how to report it, builds self-esteem and informed decision-making and communication skills, and promotes the development of respectful relationships based on gender equality, inclusion and human rights;

Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of

the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the outcomes of their review conferences, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Recalling all relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the General Assembly and the Security Council and the relevant resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women, which, inter alia, affirmed that all forms of violence against women and girls must be prevented, condemned and eliminated and that women’s and girls’ access to justice and accountability for violations of their human rights must be ensured, GE.21-09200(E) A/HRC/47/L.18 Recalling also the commitment to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 5, in particular targets 5.2 and 5.3, and the commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 16, and taking into account the commitment to leave no one behind, Acknowledging the important role played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls in all their diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Recognizing further the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and A/HRC/47/L.18 ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as facing barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, Stressing that States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access A/HRC/47/L.18 to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent-friendly health services, maternal health care and services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and services can violate, abuse or impair the right to attain the highest standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Recognizing that information and communications technologies, including assistive technology and devices, have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can create conditions enabling the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and can contribute to their social and digital inclusion and digital literacy, empowerment and autonomy, and allow them to live independently on an equal basis with others and to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in society and in the world of work, while condemning all forms of violence against women and girls with disabilities in digital contexts, including new forms of violence such as cyberviolence, bullying and harassment, and their rising prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic, Recognizing also the major contribution made by civil society, including women’s and girls’ rights and community-based organizations, organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, older women, girls and youth, feminist groups, women and girl human rights defenders and disability inclusion advocates, and recognizing further the importance of having open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment and domestic violence, by, inter alia, providing for a supportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, including by raising awareness about the human rights of women and girls in all their A/HRC/47/L.18 diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing further that domestic violence is not a private family matter and must be eliminated, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, 1. Expresses outrage at the persistence and pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide; 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms all forms of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in the context of lockdown measures and school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 3. Expresses deep concern that all forms of discrimination and violence impair or nullify the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which hinders the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others in the economic, social, cultural, civil and political spheres, and is an impediment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 4. Stresses the need to strengthen efforts to empower women and girls with disabilities and enhance their participation and promote their leadership in society by taking measures to address all barriers that prevent or restrict their full and equal participation and inclusion in all spheres of life, including through the creation of enabling programmes, community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes, ensure their access, on an equal basis with others, to economic and financial resources and disability-inclusive and accessible social infrastructure, transportation, justice mechanisms and services, in particular in relation to health and education, as well as productive employment and decent work for women with disabilities, and ensure that the priorities and rights of women and girls with disabilities are fully incorporated into policies and programmes and that they are closely consulted and actively involved in decision-making processes; 5. Also stresses the need to address multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, which place women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, violence and abuse, and to implement measures to prevent and eliminate stereotypes based on disability, gender, age, race and xenophobia, ableism, stigma, negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that cause or perpetuate discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Recognizes that a proactive multisectoral approach, working with all relevant stakeholders, including organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, is required to prevent, respond to and eliminate violence against women and girls with disabilities, including lifelong education, training and media campaigns that promote respect, dignity, accountability, equality, non-discrimination, inclusion and accessibility, as well as full and effective participation in political and public life and economic empowerment, social protection measures aimed at reducing poverty and financial dependence on other persons and measures aimed at deinstitutionalization and promotion of independent living; 7. Calls upon States to take immediate and effective action to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by: (a) Fostering respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, promoting empowering portrayals of women and girls with disabilities and awareness-raising campaigns of their capabilities and contributions, and refraining from supporting or funding campaigns that perpetuate stigmatization or stereotyping of women and girls with disabilities; (b) Reviewing laws and policies that perpetuate the outdated understanding of disability present in charity and medical models and ableism, and incorporating a human rights-based approach to disability; (c) Developing, reviewing and strengthening inclusive policies, including by allocating adequate resources to address the historical, structural and underlying causes and risk factors of violence against women and girls, and ensuring that laws and policies are A/HRC/47/L.18 harmonized to address all forms of violence against women and girls, are inclusive of and accessible to women and girls with disabilities and are implemented in compliance with States’ international human rights obligations;

(e) Ensuring the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls in all their diversity, including women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the development and implementation of accessible and inclusive national policies, legislation, procedures, action plans, programmes, projects and strategies to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls, and ensuring that such participation is conducted in a safe and accessible environment, including through support and capacity-building from organizations of and led by women, girls and other persons with disabilities, and through community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes for women and girls with disabilities;

States, and reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant international instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the

Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and their review conferences and outcome documents, and reaffirming also the resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women and the resolutions of the Commission on Population and Development, Recalling the commitment contained in Sustainable Development Goal 3 to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, Welcoming the efforts of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, within their Please recycle @ GE.21-09295(E) A/HRC/47/L.23 respective mandates, to prevent maternal mortality and to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, Recognizing that maternal morbidity, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has a negative impact on the woman’s or girl’s well-being, Recognizing also that preventable maternal morbidity is a human rights concern and that preventable deaths and grievous injuries sustained by women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth are not inevitable events, but rather a direct result of discriminatory laws and practices, harmful gender norms and practices, a lack of functioning health systems and services and a lack of accountability, Stressing the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of, inadequate or inaccessible health-care services, early childbearing, child, early and forced marriage, violence against women and girls, sociocultural barriers, marginalization, illiteracy and gender inequality as root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, equality, accountability, engagement, participation, accessibility, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, non-discrimination and international cooperation, Recognizing also that the underlying determinants of health, such as equitable access to affordable and safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, as well as quality and essential health-care services, are essential to ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing further that violations of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Recognizing also that the right to seek, receive and impart information concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights issues is essential for the accessibility of services, and that unequal access to information by women and girls, including indigenous women and girls, those from ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and those from other marginalized groups, amounts to discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and A/HRC/47/L.23 morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls, including adolescents, throughout the world, Deeply concerned also that women and girls living in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian and conflict settings, are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of human rights violations and abuses, including through sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and lack of affordable, accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment and all types of malnutrition, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overloaded health systems, the reallocation of human and financial resources, including the redeployment of midwives, shortages of medical personnel and supplies, and disruptions to global supply chains, which could undermine the sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights of women and girls, and has affected the availability of and access to health-care workers, access to maternal and newborn care and other essential maternal and child health support and services; safe abortion, when not against national law, and post- abortion care; sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights information and education; contraception; and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, while fear of contracting the virus may inhibit women and girls from visiting health-care facilities, thereby increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned that widespread discrimination against women and girls, including on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, racial or ethnic background, language, religion, health, indigenous or other status, and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination substantially heighten their risk of suffering maternal morbidities, and that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic discrimination faced by women and girls and increased the occurrence of sexual and gender- based violence and harassment, child, early and forced marriage and unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents, thereby also increasing the risk of maternal morbidity, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that the stigma, shame and isolation associated with specific forms of maternal morbidities can lead to harassment, discrimination, ostracism and violence against women and girls and can prevent them from seeking care, thereby resulting in physical, psychological, economic and social harm to or suffering for women and girls, Recognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates not only between but also within countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas and among women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and severe morbidity among adolescent girls in developing countries, and recognizing the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, A/HRC/47/L.23 Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, to the full enjoyment of their human rights, to their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, Deeply concerned that maternal morbidity reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates the full enjoyment of their rights, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, best practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy, and to guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence- based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion, when not against national law, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2.

Also calls upon States to address the underlying determinants of health, such as gender discrimination and socioeconomic factors, including poverty and malnutrition, which render certain women and girls, including adolescents, more vulnerable to maternal morbidities, such as obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others; 5. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a human rights-based approach, to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of available, accessible, acceptable and quality health- care services for all, and of information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, poverty, stigma and lack of confidentiality of medical patient records, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, shortages in human and material resources facing health-care systems, shortages in humanitarian assistance and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and discrimination, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Calls upon States to promote human rights-based and gender responsive multisectoral and cross-disciplinary coordination of policies, programmes, budgets and services designed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities with the active participation of all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, and especially the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls at the national, local and community levels, and to promote social accountability mechanisms to monitor these policies, programmes, budgets and A/HRC/47/L.23 services in order to accelerate the elimination of maternal mortality and morbidity and the achievement of universal access to sexual and reproductive health; 7. Urges States to strengthen the capacity and resourcing of health-care systems and the health workforce, to provide the essential services needed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, such as through increased budget allocations for health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and the deployment and training of midwives, nurses, obstetricians, gynaecologists, doctors, surgeons and anaesthesiologists, in accordance with international medical standards and to ensure holistic social integration services, including counselling, education, family planning, socioeconomic empowerment, social protection and psychosocial services, so that women and girls living with maternal morbidity can overcome stigma, discrimination, ostracism and economic and social exclusion; 8. Also urges States to strengthen their research, data collection and monitoring and evaluation systems to promote reliable, transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls, in order to support more comprehensive policies to prevent and address maternal morbidities; 9. Calls upon States to increase awareness and the visibility of maternal morbidity as a human rights concern, including through more targeted research in this area, allocation of sufficient resources and dedicated efforts to ensure the availability, particularly for women and girls, of information on the causes of specific maternal morbidities and their prevention; 10. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,! which focuses on maternal morbidity as a human rights issue, and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 11. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, such as by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 12. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect bodily autonomy and privacy rights and the equal right to decide autonomously in matters regarding one’s own life and health by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights law and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviour that are discriminatory; 13. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws and standards aimed at preventing violations of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, such as by informing women and girls of their rights under relevant normative frameworks and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 14. Calls upon States to ensure gender equality, women’s rights and children’s rights through inclusive public awareness-raising and evidence-based initiatives, including in schools, through the media and online, and by incorporating curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender- ' A/HRC/45/19.

Deplores the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic, which the risks created by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have further exacerbated, demands that all parties comply with their applicable obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law and that the Syrian authorities and their State and non-State allies facilitate, and all other parties to the conflict do not hinder, full, timely, immediate, unrestricted and safe humanitarian access, and, given the continuous worsening of the humanitarian situation and the increase in needs, including for COVID-19 vaccines, across the Syrian Arab Republic, especially in the north-east and north-west, notes the need to ensure humanitarian aid is delivered on the basis of need, underlines in this respect the absolute necessity of continued and expanded cross-border access to save lives, re- emphasizes the need also for immediate, rapid, unimpeded and sustained cross-line access, and calls for respect for humanitarian principles across the Syrian Arab Republic; 7.

Notes with deep concern the Commission of Inquiry’s recent comments that widespread enforced disappearance has been deliberately perpetrated by Syrian security forces throughout the past decade on a massive scale, to spread fear, stifle dissent and as punishment, and that tens of thousands of men, women, boys and girls, who were taken into the custody of the Syrian authorities, remain forcibly disappeared 10 years after the first waves of mass arrests, and notes in this regard the link between detention and enforced disappearance in the Syrian Arab Republic; 11. Strongly condemns all human rights violations and abuses in detention, including summary executions, torture and ill-treatment, including through sexual and A/HRC/47/L.6 gender-based violence, and the fact that according to the Commission of Inquiry’s estimates tens of thousands of individuals have been killed in the custody of the Syrian regime, and urges all parties to immediately cease such human rights violations and abuses; 12. Deeply regrets that the fate of tens of thousands of the victims subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance by the regime, and in lower numbers by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and other armed groups, remains largely unknown; 13. Recalls that the Commission of Inquiry found reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian authorities has continued to carry out a widespread or systematic attack directed against the civilian population, in pursuance of a firmly established policy to commit such acts, comprising crimes against humanity, including enforced disappearance, and that members of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant have perpetrated crimes against humanity, including acts of enforced disappearance; 14.

Expresses deep concern that, according to the recent findings of the Commission of Inquiry, the Syrian authority forces continue to deliberately conceal the fate and whereabouts of those forcibly disappeared, intentionally prolonging the suffering of hundreds of thousands of family members; 16. Also expresses deep concern that, while not on the same scale as the Syrian regime, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and other armed groups’ refusal to reveal the fate or whereabouts of persons taken into their custody was found by the Commission to constitute acts tantamount to enforced disappearance; 17. Expresses particular concern about the impact of enforced disappearance on children, not only as direct victims and as family members of disappeared persons, but also as a result of their increased vulnerability and risk of exploitation created by the disappearance of a parent; 18. Also expresses particular concern about the gendered impact of enforced disappearance where widespread and systematic arrests of men and boys by primarily Syrian regime forces has resulted in an additional burden for an increasing number of female-headed households, and the fact of many men and boys being missing and/or their subsequent undocumented deaths compounds the trauma and creates legal barriers for women and children in terms of access to inheritance, issues of child custody, freedom of movement and birth registration, and stresses the importance of addressing these issues; 19. Highlights the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry regarding accountability and support for victims, survivors and their families, including psychosocial support and the identification of those missing and disappeared, and in the case of deaths of detainees, the issuance of the necessary documentation and allowing families to retrieve the bodies of their relatives or be informed of their whereabouts, and notes in this regard the importance of avoiding tampering with or contaminating mass grave sites in the Syrian Arab Republic; 20. Recalls that applicable obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including with regard to the fate and whereabouts of missing persons, exist independently of a political agreement; 21. Emphasizes the need for accountability, including for crimes committed in relation to enforced disappearance in the Syrian Arab Republic, and underscores that accountability is vital in peace negotiations and peacebuilding processes; 22. Also emphasizes the vital work of Syrian organizations of victims, survivors and families working on the issue of missing persons, including those subjected to enforced disappearance, supports their efforts to compile a comprehensive, transparent record of all casualties of the conflict and acknowledges the importance of their work regarding urgent A/HRC/47/L.6 access to information about those missing and disappeared and the need for accountability and justice for the victims and their families; 23. Encourages all Member States, relevant United Nations bodies, international organizations and civil society to coordinate further efforts and proactively focus attention on the issue of missing persons in the Syrian Arab Republic, including those subjected to enforced disappearance, and recalls the importance of the full and meaningful participation of victims, survivors and their families in such efforts; 24.

Realization of the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl,"The Human Rights Council, Guided by the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Recalling all relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 32/20 of 1 July 2016 and 35/22 of 22 June 2017, Recalling also that gender equality and the right to education have been recognized in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which the Assembly addressed the need to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in order to ensure that no one is left behind, and stated that the systematic mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial, Recognizing that the full realization of the right to education for all is an essential condition for achieving sustainable development, and in this regard encouraging States to GE.21-09153(E) A/HRC/47/L.3 effectively implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Sustainable Development Goal 4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, underlining the commitment therein to eliminate gender disparities in education, and Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, Recalling the need to ensure that all children enjoy the right to education and are ensured equal access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education, the need to eliminate gender disparities in education by 2030, and the need to build and upgrade education facilities that are child- focused, disability- and gender-sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive, accessible and effective learning environments for all, Recalling also the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030 — towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, adopted at the World Education Forum 2015, held in Incheon, Republic of Korea, from 19 to 22 May 2015, Noting with appreciation the work carried out by all relevant organs, bodies and mechanisms of the United Nations system within their respective mandates, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the United Nations Population Fund and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the efforts of organizations and civil society to promote all girls’ full and equal enjoyment of the right to education, Recognizing that the right to education is a multiplier right that supports the empowerment of all women and girls to claim their human rights, including the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs, as well as in economic, social and cultural life, and to fully, equally and meaningfully participate in the decision-making processes that shape society, and the transformative potential of education for every girl, Reaffirming the equal right of every child to education without discrimination of any kind, and concerned by the continuation of the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination faced by girls, Recognizing that gender stereotypes about the role of women and girls underpin many of the barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of access to at least 12 years of quality education, and that stereotypes are also perpetuated in school curricula and materials, Deeply concerned by the wide-ranging, negative impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the equal right of every child to education and on the realization of the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl, as an estimated 11 million girls are at risk of not returning to school, Deeply concerned also by the mass school closures and the estimated 58 million children who were not enrolled in primary school prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which approximately 54 per cent were girls, Deeply concerned further that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of all women and girls and their access to education, and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence, and violence and sexual harassment in digital contexts, during lockdowns, are deepening already existing inequalities and risks, reversing the progress made in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in recent decades, Recognizing that, despite gains in providing access to quality education, rural girls are still more likely than rural boys to remain excluded from education and that among the gender-specific barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of their right to education are the feminization of poverty, child labour undertaken by girls, child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, early and repeat pregnancies, all forms of violence, including gender-based violence, abuse and harassment on the way to, from and at school and in the technology-mediated environment, the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work performed by girls, and gender stereotypes and negative social norms that lead families A/HRC/47/L.3 and communities to place less value on the education of girls than that of boys and may influence the decision of parents to allow girls to attend school, Noting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its worst forms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and affected by armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without nationality or birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child labour and that many children face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with unpaid care and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood and hamper the full enjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent employment in the future, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meets the needs of girls, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and education thereon and are excluded and stigmatized, and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, including in accessing at least 12 years of quality education, Deeply concerned also that humanitarian crises and armed conflicts are depriving children, especially girls and girls with disabilities, of access to education, and that this has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in girls being two and a half times more likely than boys to be out of school in these settings, Deploring attacks on and abductions of girls because they attend or wish to attend school, as well as all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions as such, their students and staff, and during girls’ journeys to school, and strongly recognizing the negative impact that such attacks have on the progressive realization of the right to education, in particular of girls, and the obligations of States to provide an enabling and secure environment to ensure the safety of schools, Noting that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected persons in vulnerable situations and that marginalized girls are at a high risk of not returning to school, Stressing the crucial importance of the contribution of parliamentarians, national human rights institutions and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, women’s rights organizations, faith actors and institutions and youth organizations, to ensuring the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl, Determined to give full effect to the right to education and to guarantee that this right is recognized and exercised without discrimination of any kind, 1. Recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global learning crisis that risks reversing decades of progress and exacerbating the barriers faced by all girls in the realization of their equal enjoyment of the right to education, and notes in this regard the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and other United Nations agencies and bodies indicating that evidence from past epidemics shows that adolescent girls are at particular risk of dropping out of school or not returning to school, even after the crisis is over; 2. Reaffirms that the right to education, enshrined in international human rights law, can help enable the realization of many other human rights, particularly for girls; A/HRC/47/L.3 3. Recognizes that the realization of the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl is crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 4 and 5, towards the full, equal and meaningful participation of all girls in society and to leave no one behind; 4. Calls upon States to place greater emphasis on ensuring at least 12 years of quality education for all girls in the COVID-19 recovery effort, as applicable, including catch-up, non-formal and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, and special, well-financed initiatives for keeping girls in school and ensuring their return to school throughout post-primary education, and to promote access to skills and entrepreneurship training for girls; 5. Urges all States: (a) To strengthen and intensify their efforts to take deliberate, concrete and targeted steps for every girl to fully realize the equal enjoyment of the right to education, to eliminate legal, administrative, financial, structural, physical, communication, social and cultural barriers that hinder girls’ equal enjoyment of the right to education, and to appropriately ensure non-discrimination in the admission of girls and boys at all levels of education, particularly when designing policy measures, programmes and resource allocations; (b) To review, repeal and eliminate, as appropriate, laws, policies and practices that negatively affect the right to education of every girl, in accordance with international human rights obligations, including discriminatory laws, policies, practices, customs, traditions or religious considerations, financial barriers, violence, including sexual violence and harassment on the way to and from school and in the school environment, the worst forms of child labour, early pregnancy, harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, gender stereotypes and child, early and forced marriage; (¢) To eliminate gender stereotypes from all educational processes, practices and teaching materials, including through periodic review and revision of school curricula, textbooks, programmes and teaching methods, and the inclusion of human rights education, including on gender equality and non-discrimination, as part of the mandatory school curriculum, and to ensure that all girls are encouraged to freely choose non-traditional fields of study; (d) Toprovide all girls with adequate access to water and safe, separate and quality sanitation facilities in schools and to promote appropriate hygiene behaviour and educational and health practices, in collaboration with civil society and other relevant actors, in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and girls are not stigmatized on this basis, addressing the negative social norms around the issue and recognizing that girls’ attendance at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls; 6. Calls upon States: (a) To promote the progressive realization of girls’ right to education by providing them with access to at least 12 years of quality education by implementing appropriate measures, as applicable, eliminating barriers to enable their return to school in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting continuous education throughout the pandemic; (b) To strengthen and intensify their efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of school-related violence against girls, and to hold accountable those responsible for those acts; (¢) To ensure that girls, married and/or pregnant adolescents and young mothers, as well as single mothers, can continue and complete their education, and in this regard design, implement and, where applicable, revise educational policies to allow them to remain in and return to school, providing them with access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, as well as social services and financial and psychosocial support; 7. Also calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and A/HRC/47/L.3 secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school because of, inter alia, marriage, pregnancy and/or childbirth, on re-entry policies and on vocational training and skills development, which empower young women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate, age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, with information on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills, and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 8. Urges States to promote long-term awareness-raising initiatives in education, in communities, in the media and online, engaging men and boys, through the incorporation of curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, on topics including the root causes of gender-based discrimination; 9. Requests States to ensure equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality education, which may require transformations in education systems, mainstreaming a gender perspective into education programmes, infrastructure development and teacher training, and in this regard calls upon States to invest in quality education, including through adequate financing, to ensure all girls, including those who are marginalized or in vulnerable situations, enjoy their right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination; 10. Also requests States, in the COVID-19 recovery effort, to promote gender sensitivity and disability inclusion within education systems in planning, budgeting, implementing, monitoring and reporting, to gather data disaggregated by sex and disability and to share knowledge and experience on educational programmes and policies that support the empowerment of all girls and women; 11. Encourages States to support girls’ access to skills development and technical and vocational education and training, such as by expanding the scope of education and training opportunities ranging from basic digital fluency to advanced technical skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and in information and communications technology, and to close the digital gender divide, addressing the barriers to girls’ equal and safe access to online spaces, so as not to leave girls further behind, particularly during the mass closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic; 12. Also encourages States to increase investments and international cooperation to provide equal opportunities for all girls to complete free, equitable, inclusive and quality early childhood, primary and secondary education, including by scaling up and strengthening national, regional and international initiatives, as appropriate, such as the United Nations Girls’” Education Initiative, the Out-of-School Children Initiative, the Global Partnership for Education and the United Nations Population Fund-United Nations Children’s Fund Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage, and to explore additional innovative mechanisms based on models combining public and private resources, while taking appropriate action to ensure that all education providers are qualified and adequately trained and to give due respect to human rights, including the right to education; 13. Further encourages States to allocate appropriate financial and technical resources in support of country-led national education plans, as well as an increase in voluntary contributions to the Global Partnership for Education at the Global Education Summit in July 2021, which has a critical role to play in the global education recovery from COVID-19; 14. Encourages international cooperation to complement the efforts of States in matters relating to girls’ education, in particular with a view to effectively eliminating all forms of discrimination and stereotypes in education, and supports the efforts of the United Nations system in this regard; A/HRC/47/L.3 15. Reaffirms the importance of continuing to develop and enhance standards and methodologies at the national, regional and international levels to improve the collection, analysis and dissemination of gender statistics and data on access to education, in particular access to universal primary education, the gender gap in youth literacy, the number of out- of-school children, and others; 16. Also reaffirms the importance of enhancing the dialogue between the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UN-Women, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education and other partners that pursue the goals of girls’ education with a view to promoting further the right to education and ensuring that all girls have access to at least 12 years of quality education, as applicable, in the operational activities of the United Nations system; 17.

Further calls upon States to comply with their obligations under article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and to inform without delay foreign nationals who have been arrested or detained of their right to contact the relevant consular post and to communicate with their consular representatives, bearing in mind that failure to promptly inform detained foreign nationals of their right to consular notification pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, resulting in the imposition of the death penalty, would likely violate the right to life; 8.

attacks, on educational institutions, their students and staff, and urging States to protect them from attacks, Deeply concerned that funding for the promotion of the human rights of women and girls, including for the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, is often among the first things to be reduced during situations of crisis, that child, early and forced marriage and sexual and reproductive health needs remain largely unaddressed in crisis settings, and that the COVID-19 containment measures are often delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes, including education programmes on child, early and forced marriage, and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for those affected, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, that it is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence against women and girls and other harmful practices and human rights violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of structural and institutional discrimination against women and girls, deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal traditions, discriminatory norms, gender stereotypes, perceptions and customs and disregard for women’s dignity, bodily integrity and autonomy, that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned also that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and other forms of sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to freely choose a spouse, to enter into marriage only with free and full consent and to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and recognizing that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect and consent and the freedom to choose whether to marry and whether to have sexual relations, Deeply concerned that poverty, insecurity, lack of sustainable development, lack of access to education and health services and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities and that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies and other crises are among the exacerbating factors, and stressing the need to promote sustainable development and eradicate poverty, A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 Deeply concerned also that child, early and forced marriage disproportionately affects girls and young women who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma relating to menstruation and social and gender norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities, as well as access to education and explaining consent and respecting boundaries, are some of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities and the active participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision- making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development and their full, effective and meaningful participation in economic, social, political and public life, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing also that the economic autonomy of women and investment in women’s and girls” development are priorities in and of themselves, have a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including but not limited to sexual and reproductive health, and the critical importance of ensuring that health-care services have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing all forms of discrimination, and recognizing the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions and access to comprehensive health-related education and information, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported, and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, in particular at the community level, and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and possible retribution, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of providing legal aid services with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and addressing gender inequality, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, men and boys, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate sexual and gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and to confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision- making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, organizations led or initiated by young people and feminist groups, Recognizing also that the criminalization alone of child, early and forced marriage is insufficient when introduced without complementary, comprehensive and multisectoral measures and support programmes, including across the health, gender equality and A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 education sectors and with the engagement of the whole community, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of, and the loss of livelihoods for, the families affected and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of child, early and forced informal unions or unregistered marriages, 1. Urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, which include the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution, to guarantee equal access for every girl and woman to quality education, as well as education explaining consent, respect for boundaries and what constitutes unacceptable behaviour and how to report it, that builds self-esteem and informed decision-making and communication skills and promotes the development of respectful relationships based on gender equality, inclusion and human rights, skills development programmes, vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities, counselling, social services to protect them from all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and domestic and intimate-partner violence, formal employment to increase their economic independence, and psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services and medical care, to decrease their social isolation and to increase their economic and political participation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 2.

Urges States, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, communities, not-for-profit organizations and civil society organizations, including in times of crisis, to tackle poverty, the lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives and inequalities that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage and as obstacles to leaving a forced or abusive relationship, and to promote sustainable development, including by: (a) Ensuring the rights of all women and girls to inheritance and property, their access equal to that of men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, and promoting freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as their full, equal and meaningful political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; (b) Ensuring gender-responsive social protection mechanisms, adopting measures to recognize, reduce and redistribute women’s and girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the feminization of poverty, which is exacerbated in times of crisis, including by the COVID-19 pandemic, and addressing the discrimination and gender inequality, including gender stereotypes and harmful social norms, attitudes and behaviours and unequal power relations in which women and girls are viewed as subordinate to men and boys, that are at the root of these imbalances; (¢) Confronting family poverty and social exclusion by investing in family- oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 6. Also urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, by: (a) Developing and enforcing policies and legal frameworks on and strengthening health systems, including health information systems, that ensure uninterrupted, universally accessible, acceptable, affordable and available quality, gender-responsive, adolescent- friendly health services, sexual and reproductive health-care services, information, education and commodities, HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, treatment and care, mental health services and psychosocial support, equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, including menstrual health and hygiene and nutrition interventions and prevention and treatment of, and care for, obstetric fistula and other obstetric complications, by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care, free from mistreatment and violence, as essential services in times of crisis, and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services; (b) Ensuring continuity and further strengthening protection and support services for women and girls who experience all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and domestic violence, in times of crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, especially girls at risk of child, early and forced marriage and already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice, and designating protection shelters, hotlines and help desks, health and support services and legal protection and support as essential services available to all women and girls, in addition to establishing safeguarding measures and raising awareness and providing training for police, members of the judiciary, first responders, health workers and education and child services staff; 7. Further urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and that respect and protect bodily integrity and autonomy, protecting those at risk, including in times of crisis, and supporting women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses, and to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution; 8. Calls upon States to ensure that all initiatives to , amend and implement criminal laws addressing child, early and forced marriage are part of comprehensive rights- based, gender-responsive and cross-government prevention and response strategies and coupled with protection measures and services for victims, survivors and those who are at risk of being subjected to harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage; 9. Urges States to remove any provisions that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims, in particular by repealing or amending such laws; 10. Encourages States to increase public funding for community-based organizations, including organizations led or initiated by young people, including girls, focusing on the human rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, including in times of crisis, and to mitigate the impact of crisis response measures on the ability of civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders working at the local and national levels to continue their work with girls, families and local communities to prevent and respond to child, early and forced marriage; 11. Also encourages States to consult with civil society organizations, including girl-led and youth-led organizations, as well as community-based organizations, focusing on the rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, in crisis response planning and delivery to ensure that the needs of women and girls affected by child, early and forced marriage are not overlooked and are adequately addressed in crisis response and that crisis response measures do not exacerbate factors that contribute to child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices or to sexual and gender-based violence; 12. Urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and protecting the rights of women and girls subjected to this harmful practice, including by informing women, girls and boys about their rights under relevant laws, including in marriage and at its dissolution, improving legal infrastructure, mainstreaming gender equality and human rights perspectives into justice systems, ensuring equal access to legal aid, including legal advice, assistance and representation, as well as access to judicial and other legal remedies, addressing legal inconsistencies, training law enforcement officers, members of the judiciary and professionals working with women and children and ensuring oversight of the handling of cases of child, early and forced marriage, and working to ensure that these mechanisms and remedies remain accessible in times of crisis or are re-established as quickly as possible when affected by crisis; 13. Also urges States to hold persons in positions of authority, such as teachers, religious leaders, traditional authorities, politicians and law enforcement officials, including at the local government level, accountable for not complying with or upholding laws and regulations relating to violence against women and girls, including child, early and forced marriage, in order to prevent and respond in a gender-sensitive manner, to end impunity and to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and girls and the revictimization of victims and/or survivors of such violence; 14. Calls upon States to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages, as well as working to ensure that the registration of births and marriages remains accessible in times of crisis or is re-established as quickly as possible when affected by crisis; 15. Affirms the need for States and relevant United Nations entities and agencies to improve the collection and use of quantitative, qualitative and comparable data, while observing the principles of confidentiality, informed consent and voluntary self- identification, on violence against women and harmful practices, including in humanitarian settings and in the context of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 disaggregated by sex, age, disability, civil status, race, ethnicity, migratory status, geographical location, socioeconomic status, education level and other key factors, as appropriate, to enhance research on, and the dissemination of, evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, and to strengthen monitoring and the assessment of the impact of existing policies and programmes as a means of ensuring their effectiveness and implementation; 16. Calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of, and active consultation with, children, adolescents and youth, including already married girls, on all issues affecting them, to strengthen their voice, agency and leadership, to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, including in digital spaces, that provide information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, and lifelong learning opportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, that empower them, allow them to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities, and to encourage men and boys to also act for change in their communities through being more involved in information and awareness-raising campaigns, intergenerational dialogues and peer education and training programmes, in partnership with women and girls; 17. Decides, in order to increase understanding about the concept of forced marriage, to request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize a two-full-day workshop focusing on the adverse impact of forced marriage on the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner to submit a report on the workshop in an accessible format to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-second session; 18. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to organize the above- mentioned workshop with the participation and involvement of women and girls at risk of, and those subjected to, forced marriage and to collaborate with all relevant stakeholders, including relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, special procedure mandate holders, international and regional organizations, States, scholars, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations, in order to ensure multi-stakeholder participation at the workshop.",10/07/2021,2021_3943183,Albania,* State not a member of the Human Rights Council. !

and the report of the Secretary-General on the issue of child, early and forced marriage,’ Recognizing that urgent action and long-term responses are required to address crisis situations, which may include, among other things, armed conflict, natural disasters, political instability, post-conflict situations, complex emergencies, socioeconomic strife and pandemics, representing a critical threat to the health, safety, security and/or well-being of a community or other large group of people, usually over a wide area, Noting with concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage are highly exacerbated in times of crisis and in humanitarian settings by various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, the use of rape, child, early and forced marriage and other forms of sexual violence as tactics in conflict prohibited under international law, lack of access to education, the stigma of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services and contraception, and respective social services that prevent and respond to violence, disruptions in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that crises give rise to conditions in which new human rights violations and abuses are often perpetrated and existing human rights violations and abuses often intensify and expand, Noting the gains made in ending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease in the proportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the last decade, from one in four to approximately one in five, while expressing deep concern that progress has been uneven across regions, that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are projected to result in 10 to 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that may have been averted by 2030 and that the current pace of change is therefore not sufficient to fulfil the commitment under target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, and in this regard recognizing the need for closer cooperation between States, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic gender-based discrimination faced by women and girls, especially women and girls with disabilities and others in vulnerable situations, including patriarchy, the persistence of historical and structural gender inequalities, racism, stigma, xenophobia and socioeconomic inequalities, and has increased the occurrence of sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, Noting with deep concern that the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including physical school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, will have wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences, during and after the pandemic, and are likely to increase risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence and unintended and/or early pregnancy, which may be either a cause or a consequence of increased child, early and forced marriage, as well as risks related to trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, unsafe abortion and preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, that economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work borne by women and girls and the associated risk of their not returning to 2 A/HRC/41/19. 3 A/75/262. A/HRC/48/L.7 school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services hinder the fulfilment of the human rights of all women and girls and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations and for women and girls in vulnerable situations, Strongly condemning attacks on and abductions of all girls, deploring all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions, their students and staff, and urging States to protect them from attacks, Deeply concerned that funding for the promotion of the human rights of women and girls, including for the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, is often among the first things to be reduced during situations of crisis, that child, early and forced marriage and sexual and reproductive health needs remain largely unaddressed in crisis settings, and that the COVID-19 containment measures are often delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes, including education programmes on child, early and forced marriage, and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for those affected, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, that it is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence against women and girls and other harmful practices and human rights violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of structural and institutional discrimination against women and girls, deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal traditions, discriminatory norms, gender stereotypes, perceptions and customs and disregard for women’s dignity, bodily integrity and autonomy, that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned also that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and other forms of sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to freely choose a spouse, to enter into marriage only with free and full consent and to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and recognizing that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect and consent and the freedom to choose whether to marry and whether to have sexual relations, Deeply concerned that poverty, insecurity, lack of access to education and health services and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities and that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies and other crises are among the exacerbating factors, and stressing the need to promote sustainable development and eradicate poverty, Deeply concerned also that child, early and forced marriage disproportionately affects girls and young women who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a A/HRC/48/L.7 significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma relating to menstruation and social and gender norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities, as well as access to education and information on sexual and reproductive health, including on explaining consent and respecting boundaries, are some of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities and the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development and their full, equal, effective and meaningful participation in economic, social, political and public life, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing also that the economic autonomy of women and investment in women’s and girls’ development are priorities in and of themselves, have a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and sexual and gender based violence inflicted by a current or former partner or spouse, Recognizing further the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including but not limited to sexual and reproductive health, and the critical importance of ensuring that health-care services have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing all forms of discrimination, and recognizing the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions and access to comprehensive health-related education and information, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported, and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, in particular at the community level, and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and possible retribution, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of providing legal aid services with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and addressing gender inequality, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, men and boys, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate sexual and gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and to confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision- making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, organizations led or initiated by young people and feminist groups, Recognizing also that the criminalization alone of child, early and forced marriage is insufficient when introduced without complementary, comprehensive and multisectoral measures and support programmes, including across the health, gender equality and A/HRC/48/L.7 education sectors and with the engagement of the whole community, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of, and the loss of livelihoods for, the families affected and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of child, early and forced informal unions or unregistered marriages, 1.

enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments, Recalling all previous General Assembly and the Human Rights Council resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age, and the recent extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy,! as well as other relevant resolutions, Welcoming the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the right to privacy in the digital age,? noting with interest its reports thereon, and recalling the expert workshop on the right to privacy in the digital age, held by the Office of the High Commissioner on 27 and 28 May 2020, that noted the steadily growing impact of the use of artificial intelligence technologies on the exercise of the right to privacy, pointed to transparency concerns regarding personal data collection and exchanges underlying parts of artificial intelligence systems and expressed concern about adverse privacy impacts of the application of artificial intelligence, Welcoming also the work of various special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights Council on the right to privacy, and taking note of their contributions to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy, Please recycle @ GE.21-14142(E) A/HRC/48/L.9/Rev.1 Taking note of the Secretary-General’s Road Map for Digital Cooperation, launched in June 2020, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Recognizing that the right to privacy can enable the enjoyment of other rights, the free development of an individual’s personality and identity and an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, and noting that the accelerated synchronization of online and offline spaces can affect individuals, including their right to privacy, Noting that algorithmic or automated decision-making processes online can affect the enjoyment of individuals’ rights offline, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, on the basis of international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies and the impact of surveillance on the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, necessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices and to consider potential discriminatory effects, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology, and at the same time enhances the capacity of Governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception, hacking and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age can affect all individuals, with particular effects on women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons, as well as persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, Noting further that women and girls experience gender-specific violations and abuses of their right to privacy, both online and offline, as well as violations or abuses that have gender-specific impacts, Recognizing that the promotion and protection of, and respect for, the right to privacy are important to the prevention of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, abuse and sexual harassment, in particular against women, children and persons with disabilities, as well as any form of discrimination, which can occur in digital and online spaces and includes cyberbullying and cyberstalking, Acknowledging that human rights must be considered in the conception, design, use, deployment and further development of new and emerging technologies, such as those that involve artificial intelligence, as they can, without appropriate safeguards impact the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, and that the risks to these rights can and should be avoided or minimized, including by taking measures to ensure a safe, transparent, accountable, secure and high-quality data infrastructure, by exercising due diligence to assess, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, and by providing effective remedies, including judicial remedies, and redress mechanisms and establishing human oversight, Recognizing that, despite its positive effects, the use of artificial intelligence that requires the processing of large amounts of data, often relating to personal data, including on an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, can pose serious risks to the right to privacy, in particular when employed for identification, tracking, profiling, facial recognition, behavioural prediction or the scoring of individuals, A/HRC/48/L.9/Rev.1 Emphasizing that privacy concerns should not be dismissed as a barrier to innovation, Noting that the use of data extraction and algorithms to target content towards online users may undermine user agency and access to information online, as well as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Noting also the public concern with regard to the intrusiveness and impact of data- gathering practices, the related impacts and harms stemming from surveillance and the increasing use of algorithms involved in the application of artificial intelligence systems, Noting with concern that certain predictive algorithms are likely to result in discrimination when non-representative data are used, Recognizing that racially and otherwise discriminatory outcomes must be prevented in the conception, design, development, deployment and use of new and emerging digital technologies, Noting with concern reports indicating lower accuracy of facial recognition technologies with certain groups, in particular non-white individuals and women, including when non-representative training data are used, that the use of digital technologies can reproduce, reinforce and even exacerbate racial inequality, and in this context the importance of effective remedies, Acknowledging that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, including their movements, social relationships, political activities, private preferences and identity, Recognizing the need to ensure that international human rights law is respected in the conception, design, development, deployment, evaluation and regulation of data-driven technologies and to ensure they are subject to adequate safeguards and oversight, Expressing concern that individuals often do not and/or cannot provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the collection, processing and storage of their data or to the re-use, sale or multiple re-sale of their personal data, as the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, has increased significantly in the digital age, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non- discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with regard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the steps necessary to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data or unlawful or arbitrary hacking and the unlawful or arbitrary use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, violate or abuse the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy, as a result of their activities, Noting with deep concern also the use of technological tools developed by the private surveillance industry by private or public actors to undertake surveillance, hacking of devices and systems, interception and disruption of communications, and data collection, interfering with the professional and private lives of individuals, including those engaged in the promotion and defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers, in violation or abuse of their human rights, specifically the right to privacy, A/HRC/48/L.9/Rev.1 Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights, as set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, and that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, and welcoming the work of Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the application of these principles on digital technologies, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption, pseudonymization and anonymity, are important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of opinion and expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Noting the importance of protecting and respecting the right of individuals to privacy when designing, developing or deploying technological means in response to disasters, epidemics and pandemics, especially the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, including digital exposure notification and contact tracing, Noting also that new and emerging digital technologies can contribute to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and recalling in this regard the importance of protecting health-related data, while noting with concern that some efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have an adverse impact on the enjoyment of the right to privacy, 1. Reaffirms the right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 2. Recalls that States should ensure that any interference with the right to privacy is consistent with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality; 3. Also recalls the increasing impact of new and emerging technologies, such as those developed in the fields of surveillance, artificial intelligence, automated decision- making and machine-learning and of profiling, tracking and biometrics, including facial and emotional recognition, without proper safeguards, on the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association; 4. Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy; 5. Acknowledges that risks to the right to privacy and other human rights can and should be minimized by adopting adequate regulation or other appropriate mechanisms, in accordance with applicable obligations under international human rights law in the conception, design, development and deployment of new and emerging digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, by ensuring a safe, secure and high-quality data infrastructure, by exercising due diligence to assess, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, and by establishing human oversight, as well as redress mechanisms; 6. Calls upon all States: (a) To respect and protect the right to privacy, including in the context of digital communications and new and emerging digital technologies; (b) To take measures to end violations and abuses of the right to privacy and to create the conditions to prevent such violations and abuses, including by ensuring that relevant national legislation complies with their obligations under international human rights law;

Welcoming also the work of various special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights Council on the right to privacy, and taking note of their contributions to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy, Taking note of the Secretary-General’s Road Map for Digital Cooperation, launched in June 2020, Please recycle @ GE.21-14030(E) A/HRC/48/L.9 Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Recognizing that the right to privacy can enable the enjoyment of other rights, the free development of an individual’s personality and identity and an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, and noting that the accelerated synchronization of online and offline spaces can affect individuals, including their right to privacy, Noting that algorithmic or automated decision-making processes online can affect the enjoyment of individuals’ rights offline, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, on the basis of international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies and the impact of surveillance on the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, necessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices and to consider potential discriminatory effects, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology, and at the same time enhances the capacity of Governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception, hacking and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age can affect all individuals, with particular effects on women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons, as well as persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, Noting further that women and girls experience gender-specific violations and abuses of their right to privacy, both online and offline, as well as violations or abuses that have gender-specific impacts, Recognizing that the promotion and protection of, and respect for, the right to privacy are important to the prevention of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, abuse and sexual harassment, in particular against women, children and persons with disabilities, as well as any form of discrimination, which can occur in digital and online spaces and includes cyberbullying and cyberstalking, Acknowledging that human rights must be considered in the conception, design, use, deployment and further development of new and emerging technologies, such as those that involve artificial intelligence, as they can, without appropriate safeguards impact the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, and that the risks to these rights can and should be avoided or minimized, including by taking measures to ensure a safe, transparent, accountable, secure and high-quality data infrastructure, by exercising due diligence to assess, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, and by providing effective remedies, including judicial remedies, and redress mechanisms and establishing human oversight, Recognizing that, while the use of artificial intelligence can have positive effects, it requires the processing of data, often relating to personal data, including on an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, political activities, gender, race or ethnicity, religion or belief, private preferences and identity, and including metadata, which can pose serious risks to the right to privacy, including when employed for identification, verification, tracking and mass surveillance, profiling, facial and emotional recognition, the prediction of behaviour and personal characteristics or the scoring of individuals, A/HRC/48/L.9 Emphasizing that privacy concerns should not be dismissed as a barrier to innovation, Noting that the use of data extraction and algorithms to target content towards online users may undermine user agency and access to information online, as well as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Noting also the public concern with regard to the intrusiveness and impact of data- gathering practices, the related impacts and harms stemming from surveillance and the increasing use of algorithms involved in the application of artificial intelligence systems, Noting with concern that certain predictive algorithms are likely to result in discrimination when non-representative data are used, Recognizing that racially and otherwise discriminatory outcomes must be prevented in the conception, design, development, deployment and use of new and emerging digital technologies, Noting with concern reports indicating lower accuracy of facial recognition technologies with certain groups, in particular non-white individuals and women, including when non-representative training data are used, that the use of digital technologies can reproduce, reinforce and even exacerbate racial inequality, and in this context the importance of effective remedies, Acknowledging that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, including their movements, social relationships, political activities, private preferences and identity, Recognizing the need to ensure that international human rights law is respected in the conception, design, development, deployment, evaluation and regulation of data-driven technologies and to ensure they are subject to adequate safeguards and oversight, Expressing concern that individuals often do not and/or cannot provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the collection, processing and storage of their data or to the re-use, sale or multiple re-sale of their personal data, as the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, has increased significantly in the digital age, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non- discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with regard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the steps necessary to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data or unlawful or arbitrary hacking and the unlawful or arbitrary use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, violate or abuse the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their

“Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, and that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, and welcoming the work of Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the application of these principles on digital technologies, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure
