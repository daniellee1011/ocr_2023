Federation, Singapore, Slovakia, Syrian Arab Republic and Viet Nam",N/A,Improving global road safety,"The General Assembly, Recalling its resolutions 57/309 of 22 May 2003, 58/9 of 5 November 2003, 58/289 of 14 April 2004, 60/5 of 26 October 2005, 62/244 of 31 March 2008, 64/255 of 2 March 2010, 66/260 of 19 April 2012 and 68/269 of 10 April 2014 on improving global road safety, Having considered the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report on improving global road safety! and the recommendations contained therein, Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of this Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling ' A/70/386. fan gh as ie he Ta ue Please reeyele OS) chem 16-05427 i 070416 CA A A environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, Recalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and acknowledging the importance of reaching the road safety-related targets, such as target 3.6, which aims to halve, by 2020, the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, and target 11.2, which aims to provide, by 2030, access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons, Noting that, at the midpoint of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, the overwhelming majority of road traffic deaths and injuries are predictable and preventable and that, despite some improvements in many countries, including in developing countries, they remain a major public health and development problem that has broad social and economic consequences which, if unaddressed, may affect progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that human suffering, combined with costs to countries of 3 to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product a year, makes reducing road traffic deaths and injuries an urgent development priority, and that investment in road safety has a positive impact on public health and the economy, Taking into account that road traffic deaths and injuries are also a social equity issue, as the poor and the vulnerable are most frequently also vulnerable road users, namely, pedestrians, cyclists, users of motorized two- and three-wheeled vehicles and passengers of unsafe public transport, who are disproportionately affected and exposed to risks and road crashes, which can lead to a cycle of poverty exacerbated by income loss, and recalling that the aim of road safety policies should be to guarantee protection to all users, Recognizing that road safety requires addressing broader issues of equitable access to mobility and that the promotion of sustainable modes of transport, in particular safe public transport and safe walking and cycling, is a key element of road safety, Taking into account the importance of strengthening institutional capacity and continuing international cooperation, including South-South and_ triangular cooperation, cooperation between countries that share roads across borders and cooperation among regional and international organizations, to further support efforts to improve road safety, particularly in developing countries, and providing, as appropriate, support to meet the goals of the Decade of Action and those of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Emphasizing that while each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the context of reaching the Sustainable Development Goals, international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources, 2/8 Expressing its concern that, despite the stabilization of the global number of road traffic fatalities since 2013, the number of road traffic crashes remains unacceptably high, and crashes represent a leading cause of death and injury around the world, killing more than 1.25 million people and injuring as many as 50 million a year, with 90 per cent of these casualties occurring in developing countries, and concerned also that road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death around the world for children and young people between 15 and 29 years of age, Acknowledging the leading role of Oman and the Russian Federation in drawing the attention of the international community to the global road safety crisis, Commending the Government of the Russian Federation for hosting the first Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety, in Moscow on 19

seat belts, child restraints and helmets, drinking alcohol and driving, and speeding, and drawing attention to other risk factors such as visibility, medical conditions and medicines which affect safe driving, fatigue and the use of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and psychoactive substances, mobile phones and other electronic and texting devices, Recognizing the progress made by some Member States in providing universal access to health care in the pre-hospital, hospital and post-hospital and rehabilitation and reintegration phases to road traffic crash victims and their families, Encouraging Member States to promote multi-stakeholder partnerships to address the safety of vulnerable road users, the delivery of first aid to victims of road accidents or crashes, training and education, notably in developing and least developed countries, Acknowledging the work of the United Nations system, in particular the leadership of the World Health Organization, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, in establishing, implementing and monitoring various aspects of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action, and the commitment of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the International Labour Organization, among other entities, to supporting those efforts as well as that of the World Bank and regional development banks to implementing road safety projects and programmes, in particular in developing countries, Commending the World Health Organization for its leadership role in preventing road traffic injury and for its role in implementing the mandate conferred upon it by the General Assembly to act, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, as a coordinator on road safety issues within the United Nations system® and in preparing and launching the Global Status Report on > 4/64/540, annex. 3 See

the 180 Member States that took part in the survey, Commending also the United Nations regional commissions for their work in increasing road safety activities and advocating increased political commitment to road safety, and in working towards setting regional and national road traffic casualty reduction targets, in particular the work of the Economic Commission for Europe in elaborating global road safety-related legal instruments, including international conventions and agreements, technical standards, resolutions and good practice recommendations, as well as in servicing 58 global and regional legal instruments that provide a commonly accepted legal and technical framework for the development of international road, rail, inland water and combined transport, Emphasizing the role of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration as a consultative mechanism to facilitate international road safety cooperation, Noting the work of two Economic Commission for Europe groups of experts, namely, on road signs and signals and on improving safety at level crossings, and recognizing the continuous work of the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations to modify vehicle regulations to increase safety performance, Noting with approval the Economic Commission for Europe project, in collaboration with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic Commission for Africa, under the United Nations Development Account, to strengthen the national road safety management capacity of selected countries, Taking note of the United Nations regional commissions’ study entitled “Transport for sustainable development: the case of inland transport”, conducted in cooperation with the International Road Transport Union and the International Union of Railways, which gives a fair picture of the road safety situation on five continents, shares best practices and identifies not only the road safety challenges, but also their solutions, Taking note also of the International Maritime Organization/International Labour Organization/Economic Commission for Europe Code of Practice for Packing of Cargo Transport Units, which took effect in 2015 and is intended to increase safety in the handling of containers and reduce the number of incidents across transport modes attributed to poor practices in the packing of cargo, Acknowledging a number of other important international efforts on road safety, including the development by the International Road Transport Union of harmonized and internationally recognized standards for the vocational training of road transport professionals, as well as the development of an updated Road Safety Manual by the World Road Association to offer guidance to officials at various levels on measures that can enhance the safety of road infrastructure, Welcoming the establishment of the High-level Advisory Group on Sustainable Transport and the appointment of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Road Safety, with secretariat support from the Economic Commission for Europe, as an efficient tool for mobilizing sustained political commitment to road safety by advocating adherence to and raising awareness about the United Nations legal 4/8 instruments on road safety, sharing good practices through participation in global and regional conferences and generating funds for road safety, Recognizing the commitment of States and civil society to road safety by their participation in United Nations Global Road Safety Week, including during the third Week, held from 4 to 10 May 2015, which highlighted the plight of children on the world’s roads to generate action to better ensure their safety, including the Child Declaration for Road Safety, Recognizing also Member States and civil society for their continued commitment to road safety by their observance of the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on the third Sunday in November every year, Recognizing further that providing basic conditions and services to address road safety is primarily a responsibility of Governments, while recognizing nonetheless that there is a shared responsibility to move towards a world free from road traffic fatalities and serious injuries and that addressing road safety demands

Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming the importance of the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and its Framework for Action, adopted in Rome on 21 November 2014, Acknowledging that the right to food is the right of every individual, alone or in community

an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan

food security challenges must be nationally articulated, designed, owned and led, and built on consultation with all key stakeholders, and recognizing the commitment to strengthening the multilateral system in the channelling of resources and in the promotion of policies dedicated to fighting hunger and malnutrition, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension and that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to food is threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major factors, such as the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, A/HRC/31/L.14 desertification and the impact of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the lack of development in many countries and transfer of relevant technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island and vulnerable developing States, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in particular in the said countries, Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and to sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, while noting the commitment to continuing the agricultural trade discussions as mandated in the framework of the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organization, Resolved to act to ensure that the full realization of all human rights, including the right to development, is taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in addressing the global food crisis, Recognizing

local communities in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing countries, Recognizing the need to prioritize food security and end hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food systems to the adverse impacts of climate change, and, given this situation, that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, Stressing the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable private and public investments in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, which were endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security at its forty-first session, held in October 2014, and transmitted to the governing bodies of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for consideration, Recalling further the reaffirmation by the Committee on Food Security at its forty- first session of the commitment to implement the Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security and to strive for the realization of the right to adequate food for all in the years to come, Stressing the importance of the second International Conference on Nutrition, hosted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, at which the two main outcome documents, namely, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, were endorsed, A/HRC/31/L.14 Recognizing the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and the right to food for all, Recognizing also the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 on 27 July 2012, and reaffirming the principles contained therein, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 795 million people in the world remain undernourished owing to the lack of sufficient food for conducting an active and healthy life, including as one of the effects derived from the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4.

Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food- importing developing countries, especially on least developed countries; 6. Expresses its great concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Recognizes that reinforcing the rights of girls and women, especially those who are poor and vulnerable, to education and social protection and that increasing women’s participation in decision-making and access to resources in an objective manner are critical for enhancing women’s vital role in advancing agricultural development and food security, and recognizes also, in that regard, that the promotion of agro-industry through the dissemination of knowledge, the development and transfer of technology, capacity-building and financial support is a precondition for the involvement of women in advancing agriculture in developing countries; A/HRC/31/L.14 8. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where such inequality and discrimination contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including by taking measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women and girls have equal access to social protection and resources, including income, land and water, and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and to strengthen their role in decision-making; 9.

Underlines the significance of national government policies and strategies in food production, poverty alleviation and social protection, as well as the importance of the national efforts made to ensure that women have equal access to State-sponsored benefits, facilities and services; 14. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food, and encourages States to increase such cooperation as a complement to North-South cooperation and to promote triangular cooperation further; 15. Also recognizes the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, inter alia, traditional seed supply systems, including for many indigenous peoples and local communities; 16. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; A/HRC/31/L.14 17.

Calls upon States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 19. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate small- scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches; 20. Recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 21. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 22. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and challenges to the full enjoyment of the right to food that indigenous peoples face, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the often disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 23. Welcomes the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples,” held on 22 and 23 September 2014, and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; > General Assembly resolution 69/2. A/HRC/31/L.14 24.

Recognizes the importance of giving due consideration to the adverse impact of climate change on the full realization of the right to food; 29. Recognizes also the impact of the current cycle of El Nifio in agricultural production and food security around the world and the importance of designing and implementing actions to reduce its effects, particularly on vulnerable populations such as rural women, bearing in mind the role they play in supporting their households and communities in achieving food and nutrition security, generating income and improving rural livelihoods and overall well-being; 30. ‘Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 31.

Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in this regard, and once again invites all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations A/HRC/31/L.14 agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the funding necessary to realize the right to food, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, and to achieve the aims of Sustainable Development Goal 2 and other food and nutrition-related targets; 37. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support with the goal of ensuring that all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases; 38.

Urges States, international organizations and financial institutions to implement urgently financial market reforms in order to combat and prevent financial instability, excessive debt and financial crises; 6. Expresses its concern that the level to which the overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is still low, that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-term debt burden and that some of the countries that have received debt relief are again at high risk of debt distress; 7. Reiterates its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the above-mentioned initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 8. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of low- and middle-income heavily indebted countries, and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, and by armed conflicts; 9. Acknowledges that, in least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development; 10.

Also stresses that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights; 17. Further stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 18. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting ongoing programmes; A/HRC/31/L.16 19.

Encourages States to explore further avenues for reforming parts of their legal systems with a view to developing a more equitable taxation system; 24.

hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension, there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and that these problems could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to adequate food has been threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Resolved to act to ensure

Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 795 million people in the world remain undernourished owing to the lack of sufficient food for the conduct of an active and healthy life, including as one of the effects derived from the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 5/11 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to continue to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 9. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; 10. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and promoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 11. Calls upon all States and, if appropriate, relevant international organizations to take measures and support programmes that are aimed at combating undernutrition in mothers, in particular during pregnancy, and in children, and the irreversible effects of chronic undernutrition in early childhood, in particular from birth to the age of 2 years; 12. Also calls upon all States and, where appropriate, relevant international organizations to implement policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate preventable mortality and morbidity, as a result of malnutrition, of children under 5 years of age, and in this regard urges States to disseminate the technical guidance prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in collaboration with the World Health Organization’’ and to apply it, as appropriate, in the design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of laws, policies, programmes, budgets and mechanisms for remedy and redress aimed at eliminating preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age; 13. Encourages all States to take steps, with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the 6/11 conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger; 14. Recognizes the advances reached through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, including private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle water scarcity; 16.

Resolution 70/1. 2/7 Noting with concern that poverty, insecurity and lack of education are among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Noting with concern also that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and also that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, as well as their meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that raising awareness of the harmful consequences of child, early and forced marriage, including among men and boys, can contribute to promoting social norms that support efforts by girls and their families to end this harmful practice, Recognizing further men and boys as strategic partners and allies and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and recognizing that educational opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced 3/7 displacement, armed conflict and natural disaster and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, 1.
