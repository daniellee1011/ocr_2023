girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability of women and girls to make use of their

violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and as such is unacceptable, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between women and men, and that all forms of violence against women and girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability of women and girls to make use of their capabilities, Recalling that the threat of violence, including all forms of harassment, is a permanent constraint on the mobility of women and girls, limits their access to resources, services and basic activities, and impedes their economic and political empowerment, Emphasizing the need for States, and all segments of society, including civil society organizations, the private sector and media, as well as community leaders, including tribal leaders, and religious leaders to take meaningful steps to promote the empowerment of women and girls in order to achieve gender

violence, Recognizing that women‚Äôs poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of education, health and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, are impediments to the development of their full potential as equal partners in all aspects of life, as well as obstacles to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, Recognizing also the continuing need to increase women‚Äôs full and effective participation in all actions and activities related to the prevention and resolution of armed conflict, the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peacebuilding in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions, including its resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and related resolutions, Recognizing further that harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage continue to be an impediment to not only the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the

Recognizing that indigenous women and girls, women and girls with disabilities, older women, migrants and minorities often experience multiple forms of discrimination, which may increase their vulnerability to all forms of violence and limit their ability to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political autonomy, Expressing concern that social norms and legal constraints that restrict women‚Äôs agency in the public and private sphere and their economic independence can constrain a woman‚Äôs ability to leave an abusive or violent situation and reduce her ability to access protection and secure an adequate standard of living, Recognizing that violence against women has both short- and long-term adverse consequences for women‚Äôs health, including their sexual and reproductive health, and for the enjoyment of their human rights, and that respecting and promoting sexual and reproductive health, and protecting and fulfilling reproductive rights in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences is a necessary condition to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women to enable them to enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to prevent and mitigate violence against women,
