Also strongly condemns the establishment of Israeli settlements and other related activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, such as the construction of new settlements and the expansion of already existing ones, the expropriation of lands, the biased administration of water resources and the construction of bypass roads, all of which are not only violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law, especially article 49 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (the Fourth Geneva Convention) and Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions which categorized such violations as war crimes, but are also major obstacles to peace, urges the Government of Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions as well as the resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights relative to the Israeli settlements, and affirms that the dismantling of the Israeli settlements constitutes an essential factor for achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region; 7.

Fourth Geneva Convention in this respect; 17.

Reaffirms that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and considers any change in the geographical, demographic and institutional status of the city of East Jerusalem from its status prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void; 19.

I (A/CONF.187/15). E/CN.15/2002/L.2/Rev.1 Annex Basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters Preamble Recalling that there has been, worldwide, a significant growth of restorative justice initiatives, Recognizing that those initiatives often draw upon traditional and indigenous forms of justice which view crime as fundamentally harmful to people, Emphasizing that restorative justice is an evolving response to crime that respects the dignity and equality of each person, builds understanding, and promotes social harmony through the healing of victims, offenders and communities, Stressing that this approach enables those affected by crime to share openly their feelings and experiences, and aims at addressing their needs, Aware that this approach provides an opportunity for victims to obtain reparation, feel safer and seek closure; allows offenders to gain insight into the causes and effects of their behaviour and to take responsibility in a meaningful way; and enables communities to understand the underlying causes of crime, to promote community well-being and to prevent crime, Noting that restorative justice gives rise to a range of measures that are flexible in their adaptation to established criminal justice systems and that complement those systems, taking into account legal social and cultural circumstances, Recognizing that the use of restorative justice does not prejudice the right of States to prosecute alleged offenders, I. Use of terms 1. “Restorative justice programme” means any programme that uses restorative processes and seeks to achieve restorative outcomes. 2. “Restorative process” means any process in which the victim and the offender, and, where appropriate, any other individuals or community members affected by a crime participate together actively in the resolution of matters arising from the crime, generally with the help of a facilitator. Restorative processes may include mediation, conciliation, conferencing and sentencing circles. 3. “Restorative outcome” means an agreement reached as a result of a restorative process. Restorative outcomes include responses and programmes such as reparation, restitution, and community service, aimed at meeting the individual and collective needs and responsibilities of the parties and achieving the reintegration of the victim and the offender. E/CN.15/2002/L.2/Rev.1 4. “Parties” means the victim, the offender and any other individuals or community members affected by a crime who may be involved in a restorative process. 5. “Facilitator” means a person whose role is to facilitate, in a fair and impartial manner, the participation of the parties in a restorative process. II. Use of restorative justice programmes 6. Restorative justice programmes may be used at any stage of the criminal justice system, subject to national law. 7. Restorative processes should be used only where there is sufficient evidence to charge the offender and with the free and voluntary consent of the victim and the offender. The victim and the offender should be able to withdraw such consent at any time during the process. Agreements should be arrived at voluntarily and contain only reasonable and proportionate obligations. 8. The victim and the offender should normally agree on the basic facts of a case as the basis for their participation in a restorative process. Participation of the offender shall not be used as evidence of admission of guilt in subsequent legal proceedings. 9. Disparities leading to power imbalances, as well as cultural differences among the parties, should be taken into consideration in referring a case to, and in conducting, a restorative process. 10. The safety of the parties shall be considered in referring any case to, and in conducting, a restorative process. 11. Where restorative processes are not suitable or possible, the case should be referred to the criminal justice authorities and a decision should be taken as to how to proceed without delay. In such cases, criminal justice officials should endeavour to encourage the offender to take responsibility vis-a-vis the victim and affected communities, and support the reintegration of the victim and the offender into the community. III. Operation of restorative justice programmes 12. Member States should consider establishing guidelines and standards, with legislative authority when necessary, that govern the use of restorative justice programmes. Such guidelines and standards should respect the basic principles set forth in the present instrument and should address, inter alia: (a) The conditions for the referral of cases to restorative justice programmes; (b) The handling of cases following a restorative process; (c) The qualifications, training and assessment of facilitators; (d) The administration of restorative justice programmes; (e) Standards of competence and rules of conduct governing the operation of restorative justice programmes; E/CN.15/2002/L.2/Rev.1 13. Fundamental procedural safeguards guaranteeing fairness to the offender and the victim should be applied to restorative justice programmes and in particular to restorative processes: (a) Subject to national law, the victim and the offender should have the right to consult with legal counsel concerning the restorative process and, where necessary, to translation and/or interpretation. Minors should, in addition, have the right to the assistance of a parent or guardian; (b) Before agreeing to participate in restorative processes, the parties should be fully informed of their rights, the nature of the process and the possible consequences of their decision; (c¢) Neither the victim nor the offender should be coerced, or induced by unfair means, to participate in restorative processes or to accept restorative outcomes. 14. Discussions in restorative processes that are not conducted in public should be confidential, and should not be disclosed subsequently, except with the agreement of the parties or as required by national law. 15. The results of agreements arising out of restorative justice programmes should, where appropriate, be judicially supervised or incorporated into judicial decisions or judgements. Where that occurs, the outcome should have the same status as any other judicial decision or judgement and should preclude prosecution in respect of the same facts. 16. Where no agreement is reached among the parties, the case should be referred back to the established criminal justice process and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Failure to reach an agreement alone shall not be used in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. 17. Failure to implement an agreement made in the course of a restorative process should be referred back to the restorative programme or, where required by national law, to the established criminal justice process and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Failure to implement an agreement, other than a judicial decision or judgement, should not be used as justification for a more severe sentence in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. 18. Facilitators should perform their duties in an impartial manner, with due respect to the dignity of the parties. In that capacity, facilitators should ensure that the parties act with respect towards each other and enable the parties to find a relevant solution among themselves. 19. Facilitators shall possess a good understanding of local cultures and communities and, where appropriate, receive initial training before taking up facilitation duties. IV. Continuing development of restorative justice programmes 20. Member States should consider the formulation of national strategies and policies aimed at the development of restorative justice and at the promotion of a E/CN.15/2002/L.2/Rev.1 culture favourable to the use of restorative justice among law enforcement, judicial and social authorities, as well as local communities. 21. There should be regular consultation between criminal justice authorities and administrators of restorative justice programmes to develop a common understanding and enhance the effectiveness of restorative processes and outcomes, to increase the extent to which restorative programmes are used, and to explore ways in which restorative approaches might be incorporated into criminal justice practices. 22. Member States, in cooperation with civil society where appropriate, should promote research on and evaluation of restorative justice programmes to assess the extent to which they result in restorative outcomes, serve as a complement or alternative to the criminal justice process and provide positive outcomes for all parties. Restorative justice processes may need to undergo change in concrete form over time. Member States should therefore encourage regular evaluation and modification of such programmes. The results of research and evaluation should guide further policy and programme development. V. Saving clause 23. Nothing in these basic principles shall affect any rights of an offender or a victim which are established in national law or applicable international law.",04/18/2002,2002_469889,Saudi Arabia,N/A,yes

Annex Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime I. Introduction 1. There is clear evidence that well-planned crime prevention strategies not only prevent crime and victimization, but also promote community safety and contribute to the sustainable development of countries. Effective, responsible crime prevention enhances the quality of life of all citizens. It has long-term benefits in terms of reducing the costs associated with the formal criminal justice system, as well as other social costs that result from crime. Crime prevention offers opportunities for a more cost-effective and humane approach to the problems of crime. The present Guidelines outline the necessary elements for effective crime prevention. II. Conceptual frame of reference 2. It is the responsibility of all levels of government to create, maintain and promote a context within which relevant governmental institutions and all segments of civil society, including the corporate sector, can better play their part in preventing crime. 3. For the purposes of the present Guidelines, “crime prevention” comprises strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring, and their potential harmful effects on individuals and society, including fear of crime, by intervening to influence their multiple causes. The enforcement of laws, sentences and corrections, while also performing preventive functions, falls outside the scope of the Guidelines, given the comprehensive coverage of the subject in other United Nations instruments.3 4. The present Guidelines address crime and its effects on victims and society and take into account the growing internationalization of criminal activities. 5. Community involvement and cooperation/partnerships represent important elements of the concept of crime prevention set out herein. 6. Crime prevention encompasses a wide range of approaches, including those which: 3 See Compendium of United Nations Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.92.1V.1 and corrigendum). E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 (a) Promote the well-being of people and encourage pro-social behaviour through social, economic, health and educational measures, with a particular emphasis on children and youth, and focus on the risk and protective factors associated with crime and victimization (prevention through social development or social crime prevention); (b) Change the conditions in neighbourhoods that influence offending, victimization and the insecurity that results from crime by building on the initiatives, expertise and commitment of community members (locally based crime prevention); (c) Prevent the occurrence of crimes by reducing opportunities, increasing risks of being apprehended and minimizing benefits, including through environmental design, and by providing assistance and information to potential and actual victims (situational crime prevention); (d) Prevent recidivism by assisting in the social reintegration of offenders (reintegration programmes). III. Basic principles Government leadership 7. All levels of government should play a leadership role in developing effective and humane crime prevention strategies and in creating and maintaining institutional frameworks for their implementation and review. Socio-economic development and inclusion 8. Crime prevention considerations should be integrated into all relevant social and economic policies and programmes, including those addressing employment, education, health, housing and urban planning, poverty, social marginalization and exclusion. Particular emphasis should be placed on communities, families, children and youth at risk. Cooperation/partnerships 9. Cooperation/partnerships are an integral part of effective crime prevention, given the wide-ranging nature of the causes of crime and the skills and responsibilities required to address them. This includes partnerships working across ministries and between authorities, community organizations, non-governmental organizations, the business sector and private citizens. Sustainability/accountability 10. Crime prevention requires adequate resources, including funding for structures and activities, in order to be sustained. There should be clear accountability for funding, implementation and evaluation and for the achievement of planned results. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 Knowledge base 11. Crime prevention strategies, policies, programmes and actions should be based on a broad, multidisciplinary foundation of knowledge about crime problems, their multiple causes and promising and proven practices. Human rights/rule of law/culture of lawfulness 12. The rule of law and those human rights which are recognized in international instruments to which Member States are parties must be respected in all aspects of crime prevention. A culture of lawfulness should be actively promoted in crime prevention. Interdependency 13. National crime prevention diagnoses and strategies should, where appropriate, take account of links between local criminal problems and international organized crime. Differentiation 14. Crime prevention strategies should pay due regard to the different needs of men and women and consider the special needs of vulnerable members of society. IV. Organization, methods and approaches 15. Recognizing that all States have unique governmental structures, this section sets out tools and methodologies that Governments and all segments of civil society should consider in developing strategies to prevent crime and reduce victimization. It draws on international good practice. Community involvement 16. In some of the areas listed below, Governments bear the primary responsibility. However, the active participation of communities and other segments of civil society is an essential part of effective crime prevention. Communities, in particular, can play an important part in identifying crime prevention priorities, in implementation and evaluation, and in helping identify a sustainable resource base. A. Organization Government structures 17. Governments should include prevention as a permanent part of their structures and programmes for controlling crime, ensuring that clear responsibilities and goals exist within government for the organization of crime prevention, by, inter alia: (a) Establishing centres or focal points with expertise and resources; (b) Establishing a crime prevention plan with clear priorities and targets; (c) Establishing linkages and coordination between relevant government agencies or departments; E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 (d) Fostering partnerships with non-governmental organizations, the business, private and professional sectors and the community; (e) Seeking the active participation of the public in crime prevention by informing it of the need for and means of action and its role. Training and capacity-building 18. Governments should support the development of crime prevention skills by: (a) Providing professional development for senior officials in relevant agencies; (b) Encouraging universities, colleges and other relevant educational agencies to offer basic and advanced courses, including in collaboration with practitioners; (¢) Working with the educational and professional sectors to develop certification and professional qualifications; (d) Promoting the capacity of communities to develop and respond to their needs. Supporting partnerships 19. Governments and all segments of civil society should support the principle of partnership, where appropriate, including: (a) Advancing knowledge of the importance of this principle and the components of successful partnerships, including the need for all of the partners to have clear and transparent roles; (b) Fostering their formation at different levels and across sectors; (c¢) Facilitating their efficient operation. Sustainability 20. Governments and other funding bodies should strive to achieve sustainability of demonstrably effective crime prevention programmes and initiatives through, inter alia: (a) Reviewing resource allocation to establish and maintain an appropriate balance between crime prevention and the criminal justice and other systems, to be more effective in preventing crime and victimization; (b) Establishing clear accountability for funding, programming and coordinating crime prevention initiatives; (¢) Encouraging community involvement in sustainability. B. Methods Knowledge base 21. As appropriate, Governments and/or civil society should facilitate knowledge- based crime prevention by, inter alia: E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 (a) Providing the information necessary for communities to address crime problems; (b) Supporting the generation of useful and practically applicable knowledge that is scientifically reliable and valid; (c) Supporting the organization and synthesis of knowledge and identifying and addressing gaps in the knowledge base; (d) Sharing that knowledge, as appropriate, among, inter alia, researchers, policy makers, educators, practitioners from other relevant sectors and the wider community; (e) Applying this knowledge in replicating successful interventions, developing new initiatives and anticipating new crime problems and prevention opportunities; (f) Establishing data systems to help manage crime prevention more cost- effectively, including by conducting regular surveys of victimization and offending; (g) Promoting the application of those data in order to reduce repeat victimization, persistent offending and areas with a high level of crime. Planning interventions 22. Those planning interventions should promote a process that includes: (a) A systematic analysis of crime problems, their causes, risk factors and consequences, in particular at the local level; (b) A plan that draws on the most appropriate approach and adapts interventions to the specific local problem and context; (c) An implementation plan to deliver appropriate interventions that are efficient, effective and sustainable; (d) Mobilizing entities that are able to tackle causes; (e) Monitoring and evaluation. Support evaluation 23. Governments, other funding bodies and those involved in programme development and delivery should: (a) Undertake short- and longer-term evaluation to test rigorously what works, where and why; (b) Undertake cost-benefit analyses; (c) Assess the extent to which action results in a reduction in levels of crime and victimization, in the seriousness of crime and in fear of crime; (d) Systematically assess the outcomes and unintended consequences, both positive and negative, of action, such as a decrease in crime rates or the stigmatization of individuals and/or communities. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 Approaches 24. This section expands upon the social developmental and situational crime prevention approaches. It also outlines approaches that Governments and civil society should endeavour to follow in order to prevent organized crime. Social development 25. Governments should address the risk factors of crime and victimization by: (a) Promoting protective factors through comprehensive and non- stigmatizing social and economic development programmes, including health, education, housing and employment; (b) Promoting activities that redress marginalization and exclusion; (c) Promoting positive conflict resolution; (d) Using education and public awareness strategies to foster a culture of lawfulness and tolerance while respecting cultural identities. Situational 26. Governments and civil society, including where appropriate the corporate sector, should support the development of situational crime prevention programmes by, inter alia: (a) Improved environmental design; (b) Appropriate methods of surveillance that are sensitive to the right to privacy; (c) Encouraging the design of consumer goods to make them more resistant to crime; (d) Target “hardening” without impinging upon the quality of the built environment or limiting free access to public space; (e) Implementing strategies to prevent repeat victimization. Prevention of organized crime 27. Governments and civil society should endeavour to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems by, inter alia: (a) Reducing existing and future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in lawful markets with the proceeds of crime, through appropriate legislative, administrative or other measures; (b) Developing measures to prevent the misuse by organized criminal groups of tender procedures conducted by public authorities and of subsidies and licences granted by public authorities for commercial activity; (c) Designing crime prevention strategies, where appropriate, to protect socially marginalized groups, especially women and children, who are vulnerable to the action of organized criminal groups, including trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 V. International cooperation Standards and norms 28. In promoting international action in crime prevention, Member States should set out achievable and specific tasks that take into account the main international instruments related to human rights and crime prevention to which they are parties, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (General Assembly resolu- tion 44/25, annex), the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (resolution 48/104), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines) (resolution 45/112, annex), the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (resolution 40/34, annex), the Guidelines for Cooperation and Technical Assistance in the Field of Urban Crime Prevention (Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/9, annex), as well as the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century (General Assembly resolu- tion 55/59, annex) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (resolutions 55/25, annexes I-III, and 55/255, annex). Technical assistance 29. Member States and relevant international funding organizations should provide financial and technical assistance, including capacity-building and training, to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, communities and other relevant organizations for the implementation of effective crime prevention and community safety strategies at the regional, national and local levels. In that context, special attention should be given to research and action on crime prevention through social development. Networking 30. Member States should strengthen or establish international, regional and national crime prevention networks with a view to exchanging proven and promising practices, identifying elements of their transferability and making such knowledge available to communities throughout the world. Links between transnational and local crime 31. Member States should collaborate to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems. Prioritizing crime prevention 32. The Centre for International Crime Prevention, the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network of affiliated and associated institutes and other relevant United Nations entities should include in their priorities crime prevention as set out in these Guidelines, set up a coordination mechanism and establish a roster of experts to undertake needs assessment and to provide technical advice. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 Dissemination 33. Relevant United Nations bodies and other organizations should cooperate to produce crime prevention information in as many languages as possible, using both print and electronic media. 10",04/22/2002,2002_469943,Saudi Arabia,N/A,yes
