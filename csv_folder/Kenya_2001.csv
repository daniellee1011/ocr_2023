Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenants on Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Reaffirming also its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally racism in all its forms and racial discrimination, and its conviction that racism and racial discrimination constitute a total negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Reaffirming its resolution 1998/26 of 17 April 1998, in which it recommended that the activities of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination should be focused on the preparatory

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Taking note with satisfaction of the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recalling the recommendations of the two World Conferences to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held in Geneva in 1978 and 1983, Bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), which call for the speedy and comprehensive elimination of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, discrimination against, inter alia, Africans, people of African descent, Arabs and Muslims, and incidents of xenophobia, Negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, Particularly alarmed at the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as an institutionalized governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance taking place in segments of many societies and perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which are directed against migrant workers and their families, Reaffirming, in this regard, the responsibility of Governments for safeguarding and protecting the rights of individuals within their jurisdiction against crimes perpetrated by racist or xenophobic individuals or groups, Recognizing that Governments should implement and enforce appropriate and effective legislation to prevent acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations, Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion, Deeply concerned that the phenomena of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against migrant workers continue to increase, despite the efforts made by the international community to improve the protection of the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families, Recalling the adoption by the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, Taking note with satisfaction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants (E/CN.4/2001/83 and Add.1), Noting with grave concern that, despite the efforts of the international community, the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination, Noting also with grave concern that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase, Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications, including the Internet, continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world, Aware that racism, being one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Calling for the promotion of tolerance and respect for cultural diversity as an important factor, among others, in eliminating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recalling General Assembly resolution 48/91 of 20 December 1993, in which the Assembly proclaimed the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, beginning in 1993, and

Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, Having examined the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance

propaganda and incitement to racial hatred are spreading and that racism is taking increasingly violent forms, Stressing the need to recognize that acts of violence motivated by racial discrimination and xenophobia are crimes punishable by law, Stressing also the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Acknowledging that indigenous people and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are at times vulnerable to particular forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Noting with concern the existence of multiple discrimination, in particular against women, Recognizing that failure, especially by public authorities and politicians, to combat racial discrimination and xenophobia is a factor encouraging their perpetuation in society, I.
