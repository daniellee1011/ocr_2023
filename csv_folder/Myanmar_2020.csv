The establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was proposed at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit, held in June 2009. The Heads of State and Government of the States members of ASEAN and of the Republic of Korea expressed appreciation for and welcomed the proposal. 2. A number of sessions were organized among the forestry officials of 11 countries over a period of two years to negotiate the text of the Agreement between the Governments of the Member States of ASEAN and the Republic of Korea on Forest Cooperation. The Agreement was formally signed at the fourteenth ASEAN- Republic of Korea Summit on 18 November 2011 and came into effect on 5 August 2012. II. New dialogue initiative 3. A new dialogue on the establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was organized on a multilateral platform, with invitations sent to Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Timor-Leste. The platform covered a wide range of geographically diverse areas, ranging from coastal islands and glaciated mountains to central Asian deserts. The Agreement on the Establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization was negotiated through six successive dialogues held between 2013 and 2015 among States members and prospective members of ASEAN. The Agreement was adopted on 22 September 2015 by 14 countries: Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Timor- Leste and Viet Nam. It entered into force on 27 April 2018. 4. The aim of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is to strengthen forest cooperation by transforming proven technologies and policies into concrete actions in the area of sustainable forest management, in order to address the impact of climate change. Il. Membership 5. As of July 2020, the following 13 countries had ratified and deposited their instruments and are officially registered as members of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization: ¢ Bhutan ¢ Brunei Darussalam ¢ Kazakhstan ¢ Lao People’s Democratic Republic * Mongolia ¢ Myanmar ¢ Philippines 3/21 A/75/192 7. In accordance with article 5 of the Agreement, membership is open to countries geographically located in Asia. The Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is open to engaging with partner countries beyond the region. IV. Purpose and function 8. The vision of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization is that of a greener Asia with resilient forests, landscapes and communities. Its missions are to strengthen cooperation among member countries and global and regional players in the forest sector, and to promote action-oriented sustainable forest management practices through policy support, capacity development and inclusive partnerships, in order to address the adverse impacts of climate change. 9. These missions are realized through the implementation of programmes and projects to address environmental degradation in member countries that is compounded by the changing climate. In its plans and actions, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization adheres to the core values of partnership, member- centrality, transparency, competency, equity and sustainability. Its five-year strategic plan identifies the following priority areas of intervention: (a) The initiation of customized restoration and reforestation models; (b) Support for research and development in climate change adaptation approaches; (c) Systematic management of forest-related disasters; (d) The improvement of local livelihoods and the development of community- based small enterprises; (ec) The strengthening of institutional capabilities, the diversification of resources and the promotion of regional actions. 10. As an outcome, the actions taken by the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization contribute to the achievement of broader global targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals; the global forest goals; nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Aichi Biodiversity Targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity; the land degradation neutrality targets of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; and the Bonn Challenge. Response to the efforts of global community in the forest sector 11. As noted in the background study prepared for the fourteenth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, forests are the second largest storehouses of carbon, absorbing and storing about 30 per cent of current levels of carbon emissions in their biomass, soil and wood, and have the potential to store much more. However, forests also account for greenhouse gas emissions as a result of deforestation caused 4/21 A/75/192 by forest fires, diseases and pests. By mainly focusing on the forest sector, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization has unique strengths and potential as an intergovernmental organization, since its member counties are in the Asian region, which includes diverse landscapes, ranging from glaciated high mountains and drylands to one of the world’s largest tropical forests. 12. As identified in its strategic plan, the priority intervention areas of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization are in keeping with efforts by the global community to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

'2 Resolution 68/3. 2/10 the persistent gaps in this regard, and identifies good practices and recommended actions in accessibility for the effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the disability-inclusive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Welcoming progress towards mainstreaming disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in the work of the United Nations, and noting with appreciation the launch of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and the leadership of the Secretary-General to bring about transformative and systematic change on disability inclusion across the United Nations system, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters, Recognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, and that persons with disabilities and their families should receive social protection and assistance to enable the family and its members to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with disabilities, Recognizing further the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality, non-discrimination and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Concerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to obtain health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, a lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, 3/10 Recognizing that persons with disabilities are directly and _ indirectly disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated existing inequalities, discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion and increased the risk of unemployment and poverty, as well as of violence and abuse, in particular against women and girls with disabilities, recognizing also that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as face barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may have higher rates of underlying risk factors, and have a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 disease, developing severe health conditions or being fatally affected by it, Reaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Taking note of the initiatives that the Secretary-General, United Nations agencies and United Nations entities have undertaken in order to promote disability inclusion in COVID-19 response and recovery efforts as a vital step towards achieving the pledge to leave no one behind, and noting in this regard the importance of promoting equal access of persons with disabilities to social services, quality education and health care, full and productive employment and decent work, encouraging their effective and meaningful participation, protecting their human rights, eliminating discrimination against them, and systematically collecting and using data disaggregated by sex, age and disability, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, Recognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities into development policies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, meaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development 4/10 programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,!* and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high- 3 Such as the Guidelines and
