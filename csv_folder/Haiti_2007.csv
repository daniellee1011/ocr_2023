religions or faith-based communities may, in some cases, constitute discrimination and may impinge on the enjoyment of the freedom of religion or belief, Underlining the importance of education in the promotion of tolerance, which involves the acceptance by the public of, and its respect for, diversity, including with regard to religious expressions, and of the Final Document adopted at the

Notes with appreciation that a growing network of Governments, organizations, major groups and individuals around the world recognize the importance of the sustainable development of mountain regions for poverty eradication; 3. | Recognizes the global importance of mountains as the source of most of the Earth’s fresh water, as repositories of rich biological diversity and other natural resources, including timber and minerals, as popular destinations for recreation and tourism and as areas of important cultural diversity, knowledge and heritage, all of which generate substantial positive economic externalities; 4. Underlines that mountain regions offer a wealth of vital resources like water, timber, minerals and energy resources, particularly renewable energy resources, such as hydropower, wind and geothermal power; 5. | Recognizes that mountains provide early indications of global climate change through phenomena such as the retreat of glaciers and modifications of biological diversity; 6.

Notes with concern the accelerating melting of mountain glaciers, and stresses the need to undertake immediate actions to preserve the glaciers as major reservoirs of water in the world; 12. Underlines the importance of enhancing the capacity of mountains to serve as natural carbon sinks through effective and sustainable forest management and the avoidance of deforestation, as well as the restoration of lost and degraded forest ecosystems of mountains; 13. Notes that sustainable agriculture in mountain regions is important for the protection of the mountain environment and the promotion of the rural economy; 14. Expresses its deep concern at the number and scale of disasters and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in mountain regions, especially those in developing countries; 15. Encourages Governments and other relevant stakeholders to improve awareness, preparedness and infrastructure to cope with regularly occurring disasters in mountain regions, such as flash floods, including glacial lake outburst floods, as well as land slides, debris flow and earthquakes; 16.

Notes that the awareness of the society as a whole needs to be raised in respect of the role of mountains as an important source of positive externalities® like biodiversity, flood and soil protection, water supply and quality, carbon sequestration, avalanche protection, fire protection, cultural landscapes, outdoor recreation as well as cultural heritage; 5 Externalities are defined as unaccounted side effects of an economic activity. They may be positive (e.g. preventing floods) or negative (e.g. causing floods). In mountain areas, the beneficiaries of such externalities are downstream water users, food consumers and tourists, while its providers are farmers and other mountain dwellers. In the first place, there is no market for externalities, so they cannot be bought or sold. However, a market can be created in which externalities are valorized. A/C.2/62/L.18 28. Underlines the importance of considering pro-poor national and international policies and national financing instruments, where appropriate, to compensate mountain populations and communities for the provision of such positive externalities; 29.

Also notes with appreciation the Framework Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians,® adopted and signed by the seven countries of the region to provide a framework for cooperation and multisectoral policy coordination, a platform for joint strategies for sustainable development and a forum for dialogue between all involved stakeholders; 33. Further notes with appreciation the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, which promotes transboundary cooperation among eight regional member countries of the Himalaya Hindu Kush region to foster action and change for overcoming mountain peoples’ economic, social and_ physical vulnerability; 34.

Encourages the development and implementation of global, regional and national communication programmes to build on the awareness and momentum for 6 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1760, No. 30619. 7 Tbid., vol. 1917, No. 32724. 8 Available from www.carpathianconvention.org/text.htm.

Recognizes the efforts of the Mountain Partnership implemented in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 2003/61 of 25 July 2003, invites the international community and other relevant stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, to consider participating actively in the Mountain Partnership to increase its value added, and invites the Partnership secretariat to report on its activities and achievements to the Commission on Sustainable Development at its sixteenth session, in 2008, including in regard to the thematic issues of agriculture, rural development, land, drought and desertification; 40.

Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 9 See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report on the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006 (Rome, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006). 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Pérto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (c 2006/REP), appendix G.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; A/C.3/62/L.53/Rev.1 21. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 22. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 23.
