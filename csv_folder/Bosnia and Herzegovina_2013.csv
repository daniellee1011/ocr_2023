harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, at the hands of State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and social norms that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, Gravely concerned that impunity for violations against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, taboos with regard to gender-specific violations and abuses such as sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, intersecting or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, 2/6 Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Recalling the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, by State and non-State actors against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the role, behaviours and activities of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political,

Stresses that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, which includes the freedom to have, or not to have, or to 2/7 adopt a religion or belief of one’s own choice, and the freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one’s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance, including the right to change one’s religion or belief; 2. Also stresses that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief applies equally to all persons, regardless of their religion or belief and without any discrimination as to their equal protection by the law; 3. Strongly condemns violations of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief as well as all forms of intolerance, discrimination and violence based on religion or belief; 4.

Condemns violence and acts of terrorism, which are increasing in number, targeting individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities across the world; 6.

Expresses concern at the persistence of institutionalized social intolerance and discrimination practised against many on the grounds of religion or belief, and emphasizes that legal procedures pertaining to religious or belief-based groups and places of worship are not a prerequisite for the exercise of the right to manifest one’s religion or belief and that such procedures, when legally required at the national or local level, should be non-discriminatory in order to contribute to the effective protection of the right of all persons to practise their religion or belief, either individually or in community with others and in public or private; 11. Recognizes with concern the challenges faced by persons in vulnerable or marginalized groups or situations in exercising their right to freedom of religion or belief; 12.

Also emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, where the need to protect public morals is invoked to justify restrictions, such restrictions must respect the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination and must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition, as the concept of morals derives from many social, philosophical and religious traditions; 14.

general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural

improved sanitation facilities, including more than 1.04 billion people who still practice open defecation, as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2013 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, and that these figures do not fully capture the dimensions of water safety, the affordability of services and the safe

of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and in issues related to gender equality, herein referred to as women human rights defenders, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, in the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through the curtailment of freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings,

security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, by State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated or abused and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and those social norms or patterns that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, 1 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/66/53), chap. II, sect. A. 2 Ibid., Sixty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/68/53), chap. IV, sect. A. 2/7 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing gender-based violence, including sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses, discrimination and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and can be a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Stressing the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the important activities and legitimate role of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights
