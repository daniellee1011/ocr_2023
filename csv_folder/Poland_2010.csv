GE.10-14411 A/HRC/14/L.9/Rev.1 Underscoring the fact that the duty of States to exercise due diligence to prevent violence against women and girls includes using all appropriate means of a legal, political, administrative and social nature that promote the protection of human rights and ensuring that acts of violence are considered and treated as illegal acts for which adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate punishment and remedies, including reparations, are available, Recognizing that power imbalances and structural inequality between men and women are among the root causes of violence against women, and that effective prevention of violence against women and girls requires action at all levels of government, the engagement of civil society, the involvement of men and boys and the adoption and implementation of multifaceted and comprehensive approaches that promote gender equality and empowerment of women, and integrate awareness, education, training, political will, legislation, accountability, targeted policies and programmes, specific measures to reduce vulnerability, data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and protection, support and redress for women who have experienced violence, Recognizing also that violence against women is one of the factors impeding progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, Recognizing further the importance of the full participation of women in the development of effective policies and programmes relating to the prevention of violence against women, Acknowledging that confronting and changing the harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women are fundamental to ensuring effective prevention, Stressing that the realization of all human rights by women and girls, such as those regarding ownership of land, property, inheritance, housing, financial services, including loans, nationality and legal capacity, education, conditions of work, access to health, economic participation, access to labour and disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political participation, access to decision-making processes, social security and cultural life, supported by interventions dealing with legal literacy, skills training and access to productive resources, is a key factor in preventing violence against women and girls, and that, in many instances, the different treatment of women before the law has resulted in the lack of equal opportunities for them in these areas, Deeply concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of some women and girls, including women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, refugee and internally displaced women, stateless women, migrant women, women living in rural or remote communities, women living in slums and informal settlements, women living in conditions of poverty, women in institutions or in detention, women with disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in all situations of armed conflict, women who face trafficking, sexual or labour exploitation, and women who are otherwise discriminated against, including on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status, Concerned that the threat or risk of being exposed to violence may constitute a barrier to women and girls realizing their right to education, Alarmed that, in situations of armed conflict, women are particularly exposed to sexual and other forms of violence, and recognizing the need to intensify efforts to prevent such violence in accordance with intemational humanitarian law and human rights law, 1.

Calls upon States to enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic legislation and take measures to enhance the protection of women and girls who have experienced violence, to criminalize such violence, to investigate, prosecute, punish and redress, including by ensuring access to adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate remedies, including reparations, the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence, whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in situations of armed conflict, to ensure that such legislation conforms with relevant intemational human rights instruments and international humanitarian law, to abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against women, and to remove gender bias in the administration of justice; 3. Also calls upon States to place a high priority on strengthening and implementing legal and policy measures that promote the full enjoyment by women and girls of all human rights, particularly those aimed at eliminating discrimination against women, promoting gender equality, empowering women and promoting their full autonomy, including with regard to land, property, marriage and divorce, child custody and inheritance, and to promote equal access to literacy, education, skills training and employment opportunities, land, credit, agricultural extension, adequate housing, just and favourable conditions of work, and business and leadership skills training; 4. Further calls upon States to take all measures to empower women and strengthen their economic independence, including through their full participation in the development and implementation of socio-economic policies and poverty eradication strategies, and through recognition of the value of the unremunerated work by women to better protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, to give priority to and to promote their access, without discrimination, to education, training, economic opportunity and economic advancement; 5.

Also calls upon States to support initiatives undertaken by women’s groups, intemational and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and community groups and other relevant civil society actors aimed at promoting gender A/HRC/14/L.9/Rev.1 equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls, and raising awareness of and preventing violence against women and girls; 9.

Urges States to enhance efforts to involve men and boys in initiatives to prevent violence against women and in highlighting the unacceptability of violence against women; 13. Stresses that women should be empowered to protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and calls upon States to take all necessary legislative and policy steps; 14. Calls upon States to strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacity of women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by providing HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services, to ensure protection from and prevention of stigma and discrimination, and to cooperate with United Nations bodies, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non- governmental organizations in this regard; 15. Also calls upon States to develop and implement at all levels, as required, a comprehensive and integrated strategy of prevention and prosecution of all forms of rape, and monitor the implementation of such a strategy, which should include the training of, inter alia, all relevant government and military personnel, in particular military commanders, law enforcement officials, judicial system personnel, health workers, teachers and social workers, as well as community leaders and the news media, in all appropriate aspects of the prevention and prosecution of rape and other forms of sexual violence, and of protection of and support for victims of such violence; 16.
