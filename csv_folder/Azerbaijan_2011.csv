The Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States was created in 2009 as an international intergovernmental organization with the overarching aim of promoting comprehensive cooperation among its four founding member States (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey). 2. According to the first two statutory documents of the Cooperation Council, the Nakhchivan Agreement of 3 October 2009 and the Istanbul Declaration of 16 September 2010, States members of the Cooperation Council embrace the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, along with other universally recognized principles of international law. Established norms related to the maintenance of peace and security and the development of good-neighbourly relations lay the foundation for cooperation to be developed under the Cooperation Council. 3. The Cooperation Council builds upon the common political will that has evolved through the Summits of the Heads of the Turkic-speaking Countries that have been convened since 1992. Ten such Summits have been held to date, the most recent of which was the Istanbul Summit of 16 September 2010, at which the Cooperation Council was promulgated and its priorities were mapped out. With the establishment of the Cooperation Council as a permanent body, the Summits are renamed Summits of the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States. II. Principles and objectives 4. The Preamble of the Nakhchivan Agreement reaffirms the common will of the States members of the Cooperation Council to adhere to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and encapsulates the objectives of the Cooperation Council as further deepening the comprehensive cooperation among Turkic-speaking States and making joint contributions to peace and stability in the region and the world. Member States have stated their commitment to the basic principles of democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance. Cooperation within the framework of the Cooperation Council is based in particular on the solidarity stemming from the common history, culture, identity and language of Turkic-speaking peoples. 5. Article 1 of the Nakhchivan Agreement sets out the main purposes and tasks of the organization as follows: (a) Strengthening mutual confidence among the parties; (b) Maintaining peace in the region and beyond; (c) Promoting common positions on foreign policy issues; (d) Coordinating actions to combat international terrorism, separatism, extremism and transborder crimes; (e) Promoting effective regional and bilateral cooperation in all areas of common interest; A/66/141 (f) Creating favourable conditions for trade and investment; (g) Aiming for comprehensive and balanced economic growth, and social and cultural development; (h) Discussing questions related to ensuring the rule of law, good governance and the protection of human rights; (i) Expanding interaction in the fields of science, technology, education and culture; (Gj) Encouraging interaction among the mass media and_ wider communication; (k) Promoting the exchange of legal information and enhancing legal cooperation. 6. Within this broad mandate, the organization functions essentially as a permanent mechanism whereby member States come together to discuss issues of common concern and carry out projects in all spheres of mutual benefit. According to the Istanbul Declaration, the areas of cooperation under the Cooperation Council framework are identified as: foreign policy coordination; trade and economic development; industry; agriculture; energy; transport; communications; banking and insurance; education; culture; scientific research; climate change; environmental protection; tourism; humanitarian contacts; non-governmental organizations; and combating the illicit trafficking of drugs, weapons and radioactive materials, all acts of terrorism, illegal migration and transborder organized crime. 7. In its programme of work for the near future, the Cooperation Council will focus on the theme of economic cooperation. It is in the process of finalizing its secondary statutory documents and establishing a Turkic business council and a Turkic academy. Other earmarked projects include the setting-up of a Turkic scientific research fund, a Turkic inter-university union and a joint court of arbitration. II. Structure 8. The Nakhchivan Agreement defines the following as the principal organs of the Cooperation Council: the Council of Heads of State, the Council of Foreign Ministers, the Senior Officials Committee, the Council of Elders of Turkic-speaking States and the General Secretariat. The rules of procedure also envisage a Chairman-in-Office, serving on a rotating basis. The Council of Heads of State is to meet once a year to review progress and define priorities for the Cooperation Council. The Council of Foreign Ministers is the principal decision-making body of the organization. The Council of Elders serves as an advisory body of eminent personalities. The General Secretariat is entrusted with secretarial functions, employing international civil servants from Cooperation Council member States. 9. The Nakhchivan Agreement also refers, in the context of the Cooperation Council process, to related bodies that perform their functions in accordance with their basic instruments: the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-speaking Countries and the International Organization of Turkic Culture. These bodies are to support the work of the Cooperation Council within their specific fields of cooperation. A/66/141 IV. Relations with other organizations 10. The Cooperation Council has already engaged in interaction with other regional intergovernmental organizations. Priority is given to organizations of which all Cooperation Council countries are members. As a result of consultations with the Economic Cooperation Organization, it was agreed that practical cooperation was to be started forthwith and that the Economic Cooperation Organization would finalize procedures to grant observer status to the Cooperation Council as soon as possible. Cooperation on a similar basis with the Organization of the Islamic Conference is currently under consideration. Observer status in the General Assembly 11. As an intergovernmental organization dedicated to strengthening peace and stability, enhancing dialogue, promoting cooperation and disclosing the potential for common development among its member States, the Cooperation Council fully adheres to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. By promoting deeper relations and solidarity among Turkic-speaking countries, it serves as a new regional instrument for enriching international cooperation in the Central Asian and Caucasian regions. 12. Given the clear complementarity of their goals, granting of observer status in the General Assembly to the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States would initiate a mutually beneficial institutional dialogue between the two organizations. It would bring about coherence of efforts and open avenues for future cooperation in specific areas. Furthermore, obtaining observer status would greatly assist the Cooperation Council in its endeavours to foster regional initiatives among its members aimed at integration.
