Land, Recalling resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights relating to the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian

East Jerusalem, Recalling General Assembly resolutions on Israeli violations of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, Recalling in particular General Assembly resolution 37/43 of 3 December 1982 reaffirming the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence from foreign domination and foreign occupation and for self-determination, by all available means, Recalling the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), Welcoming the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, Mr. John Dugard (E/CN.4/2004/6 and Add.1), and the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Mr. Jean Ziegler (E/CN.4/2004/10/Add.2), Expressing its deep concern at the failure of the Government of Israel to cooperate with the Human Rights Inquiry Commission established pursuant to Commission resolution S-5/1 of 19 October 2000 and its failure to cooperate with other relevant special rapporteurs, particularly Mr. John Dugard, Gravely concerned at the continued deterioration of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and at the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, in particular, acts of extrajudicial killing, closures, collective punishments, the persistence in establishing settlements, arbitrary detentions, siege of Palestinian towns and villages, the shelling of Palestinian residential neighbourhoods by warplanes, tanks and Israeli battleships, and incursions into towns, villages and camps to kill innocent men, women and children, as was the case in Jenin, Balata, Khan Younis, Rafah, Ramallah, Gaza, Nablus, Al-Birah, Al-Amari, Jabalia, Bethlehem and Dheisheh and in the Al-Daraj and Al-Zaitoun neighbourhoods in the city of Gaza, and also during recent months in the Rafah and in Al-Shajai’ia neighbourhood in Gaza, as well as during the last Israeli massacres in the Al-Nusseirat and Al-Burreij refugee camps in the centre of the Gaza Strip on 7 March 2004, Expressing its grave concern at the continued Israeli aggression and the resulting deaths and injuries, mostly among Palestinians, the toll of casualties having increased to over 2,800 martyrs and over 25,000 wounded since 28 September 2000, Taking note of the reports of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories submitted to the General Assembly since 1968, the last of which was A/58/311, Expressing its grave concern at the continued Israeli refusal to abide by the resolutions of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights calling upon Israel to put an end to the violations of human rights and affirming the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, Convinced that the basis of negotiations and of achieving a just and lasting peace should be Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and other relevant United Nations resolutions, including the principle of the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war, the need for every State in the area to be able to live in security and the principle of land for peace, Recalling all its previous resolutions in this respect, the latest of which is resolution 2003/6 of 15 April 2003, Recalling also the inadmissibility of the acquisition of others’ land by force, which constitutes a jus cogens in international law, Gravely concerned at the construction of the Israeli wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, aimed at expropriating further Palestinian lands by force, with all the drastic consequences that this wall will have on the Palestinian community, namely on its social, economic, educational, health and psychological aspects, and which is destroying any possibility of achieving a genuine peace based on the two-State solution, with an independent Palestinian State and an Israeli State, Affirming that the construction of this wall on the Palestinian territories constitutes a violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and hinders the exercise by the Palestinian people of this right, Recalling in this respect General Assembly resolution ES-10/13 of 21 October 2003, Recalling also the report of the Secretary-General (A/ES-10/248), which concluded that Israel is not in compliance with the Assembly’s demand that “it stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”, 1. Reaffirms the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to resist the Israeli occupation in order to free its land and be able to exercise its right to self-determination, in conformity with the goals and purposes stipulated by the Charter of the United Nations; 2. Strongly condemns once more the human rights violations of the Israeli occupation authorities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, since 1967; 3. Also strongly condemns the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories as being an aggression and an offence against humanity and a flagrant violation of human rights; 4. Further strongly condemns the war launched by the Israeli army, particularly since October 2000, against Palestinian towns and camps, which has resulted so far in the death of hundreds of Palestinian civilians, including women and children; 5. Strongly condemns anew the practice of “liquidation” or “extrajudicial executions” carried out by the Israeli army against Palestinians, a practice which not only constitutes a violation of human rights norms, a flagrant violation of article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the rule of law, but which is also damaging for the relationship between the parties and therefore constitutes an obstacle to peace, and urges the Government of Israel to respect international law and immediately to put an end to such practices; 6. Strongly condemns once again the establishment of Israeli settlements and other related activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, such as the construction of new settlements and the expansion of the existing ones, land confiscation, biased administration of water resources and the construction of bypass roads, which not only constitute grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, especially article 49 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949 (the Fourth Geneva Convention) and Additional Protocol I thereto of 1977, according to which such violations are categorized as war crimes, but are also major obstacles to peace, urges the Government of Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions as well as the resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights relative to the Israeli settlements, and affirms that the dismantling of Israeli settlements constitutes an essential factor for achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region; 7. Condemns once again the expropriation of Palestinian homes in Jerusalem, Hebron and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the revocation of the identity cards of the residents of East Jerusalem and the policy of imposing fabricated and exorbitant taxes with the aim of forcing Palestinians living in Jerusalem, who cannot afford to pay these high taxes, out of their homes and out of their city, with the aim of Judaizing Jerusalem, and calls upon the Government of Israel to put an end immediately to these practices; 8. Also condemns once again the use of torture against Palestinians during interrogation, as it constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international humanitarian law, of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and also of article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and calls upon the Government of Israel to immediately put an end to such practices and to bring the perpetrators of these violations to justice; 9. Strongly condemns once more the offensives of the Israeli army of occupation against hospitals and sick persons and the use of Palestinian citizens as human shields during Israeli incursions into Palestinian areas; 10. Also strongly condemns once more the Israeli army of occupation’s practices of opening fire on ambulances and paramedical personnel and preventing ambulances and vehicles of the International Committee of the Red Cross from reaching the wounded and the dead in order to transport them to hospital, thus leaving the wounded bleeding to death in the streets; 10. 11. Strongly condemns acts of mass killing of Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli occupation authorities, including the killing of children, such as recently took place in Nablus, Gaza, Rafah, Al-Nusseirat and Al-Burreij and which persist to this day; 11. 12. Also strongly condemns acts that consist of imposing collective punishments, military siege of Palestinian territories, isolating Palestinian towns and villages from each other by military roadblocks used as a trap to kill Palestinians, demolishing houses and levelling agricultural lands, as these practices contribute, together with other factors, to the acts of violence that have prevailed in the region for over three and a half years, and calls upon the Government of Israel immediately to put an end to these practices and to lift its military siege of Palestinian towns and villages and its military roadblocks, and affirms anew that such collective punishments are prohibited under international law, as they constitute grave violations of the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention and Additional Protocol I thereto, and also are 12. war crimes; 13. Expresses its grave concern once again at the restriction of the freedom of movement imposed by the Israeli occupation authorities on Yasser Arafat, the democratically elected Palestinian President, in violation of articles 9 and 13 of the Universal Declaration of 13. Human Rights; 14. Strongly condemns campaigns of massive arrests conducted by the Israeli occupation authorities to detain thousands of Palestinians without trial and without any criminal charges having been brought against them, in violation of article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention in this respect; 14. 15. Affirms anew that the demolitions carried out by the Israeli occupying forces of at least thirty thousand Palestinian houses, facilities and property constitute grave violations of articles 33 and 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and that acts of levelling farmlands, uprooting trees and destroying what is left of the Palestinian infrastructure constitute a form of collective punishment to which Palestinians are subjected, grave violations of the provisions of international humanitarian law and war crimes according to international law; 15. 16. Affirms anew that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and considers any change in the geographical, demographic and institutional status of the city of East Jerusalem from its status prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void; 16. 17. Calls once again upon Israel, the occupying Power, to desist from all forms of human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and other occupied Arab territories, and to respect the principles of international law, international humanitarian law, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its international commitments and its signed agreements with the Palestine Liberation Organization; 17. 18. Also calls once again upon Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Commission on Human Rights, as a basic condition for achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East; 18. 19. Strongly condemns the construction of the Israeli wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in the West Bank, as it constitutes a new Israeli pretext for the forcible confiscation of further Palestinian lands, it endangers the social, economic, cultural, educational, health and psychological aspects of the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians as well as their familial unity, it prevents Palestinians from having access to their natural resources and it constitutes a major obstacle to achieving a just and lasting peace on the basis of the two-State 19. solution, with an independent Palestinian State and Israeli State, the only solution which guarantees peace and stability in the region, and it also prevents Palestinians from exercising their right to self-determination; and calls on Israel immediately to stop the construction of the said wall and to erase what it has already built of this wall inside the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967; 20. Requests the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967, to investigate Israel’s violations of the principles and bases of international law, international humanitarian law and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, and, in his capacity as a monitoring mechanism, to follow up on the implementation of these recommendations and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session and to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session, until the end of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as established in Commission resolution 1993/2 A of 1993; 20. 21. Calls upon the relevant United Nations organs urgently to consider the best ways to provide the necessary international protection for the Palestinian people until the end of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories; 21. 22. Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of the Government of Israel and all other Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized agencies, regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations, to disseminate it on the widest possible scale and to report on its implementation by the Government of Israel to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixty-first session; 22. 23.

Takes note of the reports of the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (E/CN.4/2004/47 and Add.1 and 2), and stresses that structural adjustment reform programmes have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Recognizes that the structural adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, imposing fixed expenditure ceilings, and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 3. Expresses its concern at the fact that the options for macroeconomic policy of developing countries are constrained by demands for adjustment and that many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still carry very high external debt burdens relative to their gross national product; 4. Also expresses its concern that the majority of countries that reached the intermediate phase under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debt Initiative have yet to reach the final stage and that even for countries meeting all the criteria, the Initiative may not result in a sustainable debt burden; 5. Recognizes that for the heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers in the forms of grants and concessional loans, as well as removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 6. Regrets that up till now there has been little headway made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor within them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms; 7. Acknowledges that a lot of progress remains to be achieved towards a lasting solution to the debt problems of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, and that in several low- and middle-income countries unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals regarding development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 8. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals set out in the Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 9. Recalls, once again, the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 10. Calls upon the international community, including the United Nations system, and the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the World Conference on Human Rights and the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, and in this regard stresses the need: 10. (a) To implement speedily, effectively, fully and with continued flexibility with respect to the eligibility criteria the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which should be fully financed through additional resources, taking into consideration, as appropriate, measures to address any fundamental changes in the economic circumstances of those developing countries that have an unsustainable debt burden caused by natural catastrophes, severe terms-of-trade shocks or conflict, taking into account initiatives which have been undertaken to reduce outstanding indebtedness; (b) To encourage exploring innovative mechanisms to comprehensively address the debt problems of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries and including middle-income countries and countries with economies in transition; 11. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration contained in the annex to resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 11. 12. Also recalls the conclusion of the statement on poverty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001, that some of the structural obstacles confronting developing States’ anti-poverty strategies lie beyond their control in the contemporary international order and that it is imperative that measures be taken urgently to remove these global structural obstacles, such as unsustainable foreign debt, the widening gap between rich and poor, and the absence of an equitable multilateral trade, investment and financial system; otherwise, the national anti-poverty strategies of some States have limited chance of sustainable 12. SUCCESS; 13. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven, with the participation of people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the national context, priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of 13. human rights; 14. Also stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 14. 15. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting the 15. ongoing programmes; 16. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 16. 17. Requests the independent expert to further explore, in his analytical annual report to the Commission, the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 17. 18. Also requests the independent expert, in the discharge of his mandate, to general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure that compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as provided for in the international human rights instruments, and to present a preliminary on this matter to the Commission at its sixty- first session and a final at the sixty-second session of the 18. Commission,; 19. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to carry out his functions; 19. 20. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 20. 21. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 21. 22. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 22. 23. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay particular attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 23.

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1. Stresses that the proposal of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and, therefore, unacceptable; 11. 12. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office in Geneva; 12. 13. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 13. 14. Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 14. 15. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from non-represented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 15. 16. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 16. 17. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 17. 18. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 18. 19. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 19. 20. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 20. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 21. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of his mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 21. 22. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 22. Also requests the High Commissioner: 23. (a) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (b) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; () To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-first session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 24. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 25. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Right (JIU/REP/2003/6), in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 25. 26. Requests the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other intergovernmental bodies of the Organization regarding the management, programmes and 26. administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; Decides to consider this matter under the same agenda item at its 27. sixty-first session.

Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and, therefore, requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination,; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; 3.

Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 5.
