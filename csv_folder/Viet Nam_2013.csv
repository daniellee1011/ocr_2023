Please reeyele OO GE.13-11998 A/HRC/22/L.16 Bearing in mind the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the World Food Summit Plan of Action and the Declaration of the World Food Summit, adopted on 13 June 2002, the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, and the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-importing Countries, adopted on 15 April 1994, Reaffirming the commitment made in the ministerial declaration of the 2009 high- level segment of the Economic and Social Council to eliminating hunger and to securing food for all, Reaffirming also the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, Recalling the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security, Convinced that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis as a combination of several major factors, such as the global financial and economic crisis, also affected negatively by environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of development in many countries and transfer of relevant technology to address this issue, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries, that are having a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in particular in the said countries, Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, A/HRC/22/L.16 Recognizing the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including women, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing countries, Stressing the importance of reversing the substantial decline in assistance devoted to agriculture since 1980, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, while noting the recent partial inversion of this trend, Recalling the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, as well as that the realization of the right to food not only entails an increase in productivity but also a holistic approach that includes a focus on smallholder and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, and groups in the most vulnerable situations, as well as national and international policies that are conducive to the realization of this right, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable private and public investments in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Welcoming the adoption of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth special session and the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its one hundred and forty- fourth session, in 2012, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, according to an estimation by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 years do so from hunger-related illness, and that, according to an estimation by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are undernourished is approximately 870 million worldwide, 98 per cent of them living in developing countries, and that there is an additional one billion people suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, even though, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed twelve billion people; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food- importing countries, especially on least developed countries; 5. Also expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; A/HRC/22/L.16 6. Encourages all States to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to social protection and to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7. Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate into and effectively implement a gender perspective and a human rights perspective in their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 8. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 9. Encourages States to take steps with a view to progressively achieve the full realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms and adopt national plans to combat hunger; 10. Underlines the significance of national government policies and strategies on food production and poverty alleviation; 11. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food, and encourages States to increase such cooperation as a complement to North-South cooperation; 12. — Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls; 13. Calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, paragraph 2, thereof, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 14. Calls upon States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small- scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches; A/HRC/22/L.16 16. Recognizes that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farmers, in particular women farmers, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender- sensitive agricultural policies are important tools to achieve security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and the provision of the right to food; 17. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 18. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 19. Requests all States and private actors, and international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 20. Encourages all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security; 21. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 22. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 23. Calls for the early conclusion and a successful, development-oriented outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution to creating international conditions permitting the full realization of the right to food; 24. Stresses that all States should make every effort to ensure that their international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 25. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all stakeholders; A/HRC/22/L.16 26. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 27. Recognizes that the commitments made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of people who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in that regard, and urges all States and international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding for realizing the aim of halving by 2015 the number, or at least the proportion, of people who suffer from hunger, as stated in Millennium Development Goal 1, as well as the right to food, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium Declaration; 28. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases; 29. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 30. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance, as an effective contribution to both the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, and the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities relating to emergency situations for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 31. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 32. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently occurring across Africa, in particular in the Horn of Africa and in the Sahel, and expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to cut operations across different regions, including southern A frica; 33. Encourages developing countries to establish regional arrangements, where they do not exist, with the support of the international community and development partners to ensure adequate food production and thereby contribute to ensuring food security, in particular in developing countries that have scarce fertile land; 34. | Acknowledges the adoption by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations of a regional approach towards ensuring food security, and expresses its appreciation for the current collaboration with all Rome-based institutions working comprehensively towards the realization of the right to food; 35. | Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the private sector to the A/HRC/22/L.16 realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; 36. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue his collaboration with relevant international organizations and United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, in particular the Rome-based ones, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Programme, in order to contribute to ensuring that the right to food is promoted further within these organizations, in accordance with their respective mandates, including for the advancement of smallholders and agricultural workers in both developing and least developed countries; 37.

Historical background 1. The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) was established at the initiative of the Republic of Korea, with a vision of shifting the current development paradigm of quantity-oriented, fossil-fuel-dependent growth to quality-oriented and sustainable economic growth. In the new paradigm, green economy and green growth are dynamic tools to achieve sustainable development, addressing the economic, environmental and social pillars in a balanced way and with a strong focus on implementation. The Institute originated as an amalgamation of ideas from the public and private sectors committed to helping developing countries on the transition towards a low-carbon, inclusive and sustainable economic growth path. 2. The Institute was initially formed as a non-profit foundation under the domestic laws of the Republic of Korea in May 2010 and became an international organization when the Agreement on the Establishment of the Global Green Growth Institute was signed in June 2012 and entered into force in October 2012. 3. Membership in the Institute is, in accordance with article 5 of the Agreement, open to any Member State of the United Nations as well as to regional integration organizations. 4. As of June 2013, the Institute had 20 member States. The Institute is headquartered in Seoul and has branch offices in Copenhagen, Abu Dhabi and London. IJ. The instrument establishing the Global Green Growth Institute 5. The Agreement that established the Global Green Growth Institute was signed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 20 June 2012 by the Commonwealth of Australia, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of Costa Rica, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, the Republic of Kiribati, the Kingdom of Norway, the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Paraguay, the State of Qatar, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. 6. The Agreement was also subsequently signed by the Republic of the Philippines, on 21 June 2012, the Republic of Indonesia, on 17 September 2012, the United Mexican States, on 12 October 2012, and Mongolia and the Republic of Rwanda, on 9 June 2013. The Agreement entered into force on 18 October 2012. III. Members 7. Currently, the following 20 countries are the member States of the Global Green Growth Institute: 3/10 A/68/191 Australia Cambodia Costa Rica Denmark Ethiopia Guyana Indonesia Kiribati Mexico Mongolia Norway Papua New Guinea Paraguay Philippines Qatar Republic of Korea Rwanda United Arab Emirates United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Viet Nam IV. Purpose and function 8. Pursuant to article 2 of the Agreement, “[t]he GGGI shall promote sustainable development of developing and emerging countries, including the least developed countries, by: (a) supporting and diffusing a new paradigm of economic growth: green growth, which is a balanced advance of economic growth and environmental sustainability; (b) targeting key aspects of economic performance and resilience, poverty reduction, job creation and social inclusion, and those of environmental sustainability such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity protection and securing access to affordable, clean energy, clean water and land; and (c) creating and improving the economic, environmental and social conditions of developing and emerging countries through partnerships between developed and developing countries and the public and private sectors.” 9. The Institute supports developing countries that seek to leapfrog the resource- intensive and environmentally unsustainable model of economic development pioneered in an earlier era by industrialized economies, by providing them with tailored and sustained programmes of technical and capacity-building assistance. In this way, the Institute assists developing countries in pursuing the green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, as an important tool for achieving sustainable development. 10. The Institute’s core activity is green growth planning and implementation, through which it provides expert technical assistance and capacity-building to developing countries and emerging economies. Currently, the Institute has green growth planning and implementation programmes in 18 developing countries, as well as 3 multi-country programmes. Through these programmes, the Institute supports developing countries and emerging economies in their development of green and inclusive economic development strategies, and their implementation of these strategies, including through financial analysis and public-private cooperation. 4/10 A/68/191 11. The Institute provides the best available analytical tools and helps build institutional capacity to apply them, through a tailored, consistent programme for partner countries based on specific national circumstances and_ priorities. Programmes are implemented in close cooperation with partner countries, including national, provincial and municipal authorities. The Institute maintains a presence on the ground to facilitate capacity-building and ensure full country ownership. 12. The Institute initiates its cooperation programmes on the basis of a high-level request from a developing country Government. The Institute’s approach is particularly suited to developing countries because its point of departure is inclusive and green economic growth, leading to broad-based progress in living standards and quality of life. 13. The scope of work for the Institute in a developing country depends on the country’s specific situation and development goals. Initially, and in close collaboration with the Government, the Institute conducts a comprehensive diagnosis of the country’s green growth potential and its internal and external challenges. The diagnosis involves assessing physical and socioeconomic conditions as well as the potential for aligning an inclusive green economy approach with the country’s development priorities. The next step establishes a green growth pathway, refines the policy options available and identifies the options for implementation, in particular financing and public-private cooperation. This includes actions in priority sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, water, transport and energy, according to the partner country’s specific circumstances and priorities. 14. Currently, the Institute cooperates with the following countries and provinces (in alphabetical order): (a) Africa: the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Kingdom of Morocco, the Republic of Rwanda and the Republic of South Africa; (b) Asia: the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Republic of Indonesia, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, Karnataka (Republic of India), the Republic of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Republic of the Philippines, the Kingdom of Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and Yunnan Province (in the People’s Republic of China); (c) Latin America and the Caribbean: the Federative Republic of Brazil, the United Mexican States and the Republic of Peru. 15. In addition, the Institute has multi-country programmes in the Amazon, Aral Sea and Mekong regions. A programme among small island developing States is under preparation. 16. In the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Institute supported the Government in establishing institutional and legal frameworks and elaborating a national green growth policy and strategy. The strategy identifies a number of specific actions, and currently the Institute is looking into how best to support their implementation. 17. In the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, the Institute supported the Government in developing a climate-resilient green economy plan. This included national strategies on climate resilience and green economy (low-carbon development), underpinned by scientific and economic analysis. Currently, the Institute is supporting the Government in implementing the green economy plan, including setting concrete targets across different sectors and regions and assessing 5/10 A/68/191 the policies required, taking into account barriers to implementation, to meet these targets. 18. In the People’s Republic of China, the Institute plans to assist Yunnan Province in pursuing green growth by developing a five-year green growth action plan in line with the national and provincial development plans. The Institute also focuses on selected sectoral projects and provides training to key stakeholders in order to build local capacity in green growth planning and implementation. 19. In the United Mexican States, the Institute and the Government have designed a jointly funded programme of collaboration that supports the federal Government in developing a climate-resilience plan aimed at reducing economic vulnerability, especially among the poorest populations. It is also developing proposals for public- private cooperation and creating South-South dialogue and knowledge transfer. 20. The Institute’s two other programmes — research and _ public-private cooperation — are designed to support the delivery of the green growth planning and implementation programmes, in particular the quality of the analytical and implementation support provided to the Governments of developing countries. This includes South-South and North-South knowledge-sharing. 21. The Institute’s research programme analyses the development of the green growth paradigm in developing countries by conducting research on green growth theory and practice. The focus is on areas where there is the greatest need for additional research, identified jointly with senior policymakers (e.g., chief economic advisers and finance, economy and planning ministries) and leading economists in developing and emerging countries. The main outcome is relevant, high-quality research that explores the potential of inclusive green growth and provides practical guidance to policymakers, especially in developing and emerging countries. 22. The research programme prioritizes the following topic areas as they apply to developing and emerging countries: green growth planning tools and methodology; lessons from in-country green growth planning experience; economic theory and policy of green growth; resource efficiency and green growth, including sectoral opportunities and approaches; technological innovation and green growth; employment and poverty reduction; social innovation and welfare; the political economy of green growth; and international economic cooperation and green growth. 23. Some of the Institute’s research is generated primarily by in-house researchers and draws heavily on the Institute’s green growth planning and implementation experience in developing and emerging countries. Other research is conducted in partnership with leading economic policy institutes and research centres in both developing and advanced countries, especially on more theoretical and technology- focused issues. 24. Among the initiatives carried out under the research programme which may provide useful inputs to United Nations processes are the Green Growth Knowledge Platform and the Green Growth Best Practices. In the Green Growth Knowledge Platform, the Institute cooperates with the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to create a global network of researchers and development experts with the aim of identifying and addressing major knowledge gaps in green economy and green growth theory and practice. The Platform provides policymakers 6/10 A/68/191 with the tools to facilitate the transition, and identifies and addresses major knowledge gaps in green economy theory and practice, in order to help countries design and implement policies to move towards a green economy. 25. The Green Growth Best Practices initiative conducts fact-based analysis of green growth best practices with a team of expert authors from all regions. The assessment results are documented and shared through handbooks, policy briefs, training materials, a website and other audience-tailored resources, as well as through policy dialogue workshops, outreach to countries, webinars and other learning forums. In this initiative, the Institute cooperates with the Climate and Development Knowledge Network and the European Climate Foundation. 26. The Institute’s public-private cooperation programme facilitates the engagement of the resources and expertise of the private sector, both domestically and internationally, in the implementation of green growth strategies in the Institute’s partner countries. 27. Through this programme, the Institute facilitates public-private cooperation by linking companies to developing country Governments that are seeking private sector finance, technology and expertise to accelerate the implementation of their green growth or green economy plans. The Institute connects the partner countries with potential private sector providers of capital and technology by developing specific investment plans in key sectors that help tap domestic and external, as well as public and private, sources of finance. 28. In addition, the public-private cooperation programme builds intra- and cross- industry programmes of cooperation, and links them to relevant intergovernmental processes, to expand markets in developing and emerging countries for resource- efficient products, services and industrial processes, and to facilitate technology transfer. The programme elevates the importance that political and business leaders attach to the role of public-private cooperation for implementation. 29. As part of the public-private cooperation programme, the Institute acts as a strategic partner of the Global Green Growth Forum, which is a_ high-level partnership of three developed countries (the Kingdom of Denmark, the Republic of Korea and the State of Qatar) and three developing countries (the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Kenya and the United Mexican States) that seeks to support the innovation and scaling-up of private sector engagement in various aspects of green growth. 30. In June 2013, in recognition of the sustainable benefits that the Institute has brought and will be able to bring to developing and emerging countries, the OECD Development Assistance Committee Working Party on Development Finance Statistics approved the addition of the Institute to the list of international organizations eligible for official development assistance. V. Governance bodies 31. The Institute’s governance structure consists of the Assembly, the Council and the Secretariat, whose functions are as follows: (a) The Assembly is composed of the members of the Institute and meets every two years. The functions of the Assembly include advising on the overall 7/10 A/68/191 direction of the Institute and reviewing the organization’s progress in meeting its stated objectives. The Assembly also elects Council members and appoints a Director General; (b) The Council serves as the executive organ of the Institute and thus approves the organization’s strategy, budget, admission of new members and criteria for its programmes; (c) The Secretariat acts as the chief operational organ of the organization and is headed by the Director General, who represents the Institute externally and provides strategic leadership for the organization in carrying out its objectives. VI. Observer status in the United Nations General Assembly 32. The Institute is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations process on sustainable development and the attainment of internationally agreed development goals. 33. The Institute and its members adhere fully to the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. 34. As a new international organization with a focus on developing countries, the Institute contributes in a concrete way towards the objectives and frameworks established by the United Nations and other international bodies in the areas of sustainable development and poverty reduction, including Agenda 21; the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy; the Istanbul Programme of Action; the internationally agreed commitments related to Africa’s development needs; the Millennium Development Goals; the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation; and the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want” (General Assembly resolution 66/288, annex). 35. Consistent with, and in active support of, these United Nations frameworks, the Institute cooperates with developing countries and emerging economies to facilitate and implement the transition towards a green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication, as defined and detailed in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. 36. Through its programmes, the Institute helps developing countries and emerging economies to achieve sustainable development through green economy policies, to integrate the green economy potential into their national development strategies and investment plans, and to mobilize national and international resources. 37. Developing countries sometimes lack the expertise to build “bankable” investment cases, leading to difficulties in attracting finance. The Institute helps fill this gap through its familiarity with the country’s green growth plan, the strategic relationship it builds with the Government in helping to design their plans, and its neutrality in the sense of not being a financing agency or bilateral cooperation partner. 38. Cooperation with the Institute makes partner countries ready to benefit from international funding sources which support investments in a green economy, including the Green Climate Fund and other climate financing mechanisms. 8/10 A/68/191 39. Granting the Institute observer status in the General Assembly would enable the Institute to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes, based on real-life experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. 40. The Institute can contribute valuable and innovative analytical inputs and knowledge to the United Nations by providing: (a) Best practice experience and tools for the implementation of green economy policies and legislation; (b) Macroeconomic and cross-sectoral analysis on the green economy, including impacts on poverty alleviation and productive employment; (c) Analysis of financial options, investment flows and market-based mechanisms, such as payment of ecosystem services; (d) Analysis on the green economy potential of key areas, such as energy, water, oceans and seas, agriculture, forestry, transport, tourism, urban development, and climate change adaptation and mitigation, and on cross-sectoral interlinkages, such as the water-food-energy nexus; (e) Models for involving businesses and industry in the green economy, including small and medium-sized enterprises, e.g., through public-private partnerships, innovation and technology transfer; and (f) Indicators for measuring progress towards a green economy. 9/10 A/68/191 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for the Global Green Growth Institute in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Wishing to promote cooperation between the United Nations and the Global Green Growth Institute, 1.

Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7.
