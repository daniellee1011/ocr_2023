enabling their work in recent resolutions and the panel discussion on women human rights defenders convened on 26 June 2012, Acknowledging that women of all ages who engage in the defence of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and those related to gender, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, including in addressing all forms of human rights violations, combating impunity, fighting poverty and discrimination, and promoting access to justice, democracy, the full participation of women in society, tolerance, human dignity and the right to development, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through restrictions on freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings, Gravely concerned that women human rights defenders are at risk of and suffer violations and abuses, including systematic violations of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, at the hands of State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those

various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and social norms that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, Gravely concerned that impunity for violations against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, taboos with regard to gender-specific violations and abuses such as sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, intersecting or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, 2/6 Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile

discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Recalling the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, by State and non-State actors against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face

criminalization or stigmatization of the role, behaviours and activities of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political,

Stresses that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, which includes the freedom to have, or not to have, or to 2/7 adopt a religion or belief of one’s own choice, and the freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one’s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance, including the right to change one’s religion or belief; 2. Also stresses that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief applies equally to all persons, regardless of their religion or belief and without any discrimination as to their equal protection by the law; 3. Strongly condemns violations of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief as well as all forms of intolerance, discrimination and violence based on religion or belief; 4.

Condemns violence and acts of terrorism, which are increasing in number, targeting individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities across the world; 6. Emphasizes that no religion should be equated with terrorism, as this may have adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of all members of the religious communities concerned; 7.

Expresses concern at the persistence of institutionalized social intolerance and discrimination practised against many on the grounds of religion or belief, and emphasizes that legal procedures pertaining to religious or belief-based groups and places of worship are not a prerequisite for the exercise of the right to manifest one’s religion or belief and that such procedures, when legally required at the national or local level, should be non-discriminatory in order to contribute to the effective protection of the right of all persons to practise their religion or belief, either individually or in community with others and in public or private; 11. Recognizes with concern the challenges faced by persons in vulnerable or marginalized groups or situations in exercising their right to freedom of religion or belief; 12.

Also emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, where the need to protect public morals is invoked to justify restrictions, such restrictions must respect the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination and must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition, as the concept of morals derives from many social, philosophical and religious traditions; 14.

All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Recalling its resolution 53/144 of 9 December 1998, by which it adopted by consensus the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms annexed to that resolution, and reiterating the fundamental importance of the Declaration and its promotion and implementation, 13-57665* ih 251113 CA AY A A Recalling also all previous resolutions on this subject, including its resolution 66/164 of 19 December 2011 and Human Rights Council resolutions 16/5 of 24 March 20111 and 22/6 of 21 March 2013,2 Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and their review outcomes, as well as the agreed conclusions and resolutions of the Commission on the Status of Women, Acknowledging the attention given by the Human Rights Council to the importance of women human rights defenders and of ensuring their protection and enabling their work in recent resolutions, and noting the panel discussion on women human rights defenders convened on 26 June 2012, Acknowledging that women of all ages who engage in the defence of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and in issues related to gender equality, herein referred to as women human rights defenders, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, in the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through the curtailment of freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings, Gravely concerned that women human rights defenders are at risk of and suffer violations and abuses, including systematic violations and abuses of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, by State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated or abused and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and those social norms or patterns that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, 1 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/66/53), chap. II, sect. A. 2 Ibid., Sixty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/68/53), chap. IV, sect. A. 2/7 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing gender-based violence, including sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses, discrimination and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and can be a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Stressing the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the important activities and legitimate role of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Recalling that the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms rests with the State, and reaffirming that national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other international obligations of the State in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms is the juridical framework within which human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, conduct their activities, Gravely concerned that, in some instances, national security and counter- terrorism legislation and other measures, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, have been misused to target human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, or have hindered their work and endangered their safety in a manner contrary to international law, Recognizing the urgent need to address, and to take concrete steps to prevent and stop, the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, to exercise their work, including by reviewing and, where necessary, amending relevant legislation and its implementation in order to ensure compliance with international human rights law, 3/7 Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political, social, legal and economic status are essential to respect for all human rights, the growth and prosperity of society and the achievement of representative, transparent and accountable government, democratic institutions and sustainable development in all areas of
