Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and, therefore, requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination,; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that there are around 852 million undernourished people in the world, that every five seconds a child under the age of five dies, directly or indirectly, of hunger or hunger-related disease somewhere in the world and that one person loses his/her eyesight every four minutes as a result of a lack of vitamin A when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to provide 2,100 kilocalories per person per day to 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality, that in many countries gitls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition and, in that sense, encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate; 5. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 6. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of undernourished persons are not being fulfilled and that, on the contrary, global hunger increased yet again this year, and invites once again all international financial and developmental institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority and provide necessary funding to help realize the aim to halve by the year 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as to realize the right to food; 7. Encourages all States to take steps with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and as soon as possible enjoy fully the right to food, as well as to elaborate and adopt national plans to combat hunger; 8. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 9.

Welcomes the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and international levels, oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all; 12. 13. Recalls general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant) adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in which the Committee notes, inter alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture in the realization of the right to adequate food; 13. 14. Welcomes the meeting of world leaders for action against hunger and poverty, convened by the Presidents of Brazil, Chile and France and the Prime Minister of Spain, with the support of the Secretary-General, and the resulting New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, which has been supported by more that one hundred countries to date, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for 14. the fight against hunger and poverty; 15.

Takes note with appreciation of the report of the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (E/CN.4/2005/42), and stresses that structural adjustment reform programmes have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Welcomes the proposals of the independent expert for elements of basic principles and for action at the national and international levels in the development of general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making on and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, and encourages the independent expert to continue to take into account in this regard the relevant past and new initiatives of the General Assembly, the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, social and cultural development of its people, and to this end has the right and responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 4. Recognizes that the structural adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, imposing fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 5. Expresses its concern at the fact that the options for macroeconomic policy of developing countries are constrained by demands for adjustment and that many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still carry very high external debt burdens relative to their gross national product; 6. Also expresses its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of the overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-term debt burden; 7. Reiterates its conviction that for the heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers in the form of grants and concessional loans, as well as removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 8. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of middle-income and low-income heavily indebted countries, and that until now there has been little headway made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor within them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected recently by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, as well as by armed conflicts; 9. Acknowledges that in the least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals regarding development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 10. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official 10. development assistance; 11. Recalls once again the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 11. 12. Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, and the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 12. 13. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration contained in the annex to resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 13. 14. Stresses the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of human rights; 14. 15. Also stresses that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to overall realization of all human rights; 15. 16. Further stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 16. 17. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting the 17. ongoing programmes; 18. Reaffirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 18. 19. Requests the independent expert to explore further, in his analytical annual report to the Commission, the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 19. 20. Recalls its requests to the independent expert, in the discharge of his mandate, to present to the Commission at its sixty- second session a final of general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making on and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, 20. including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure that compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as provided for in the international human rights instruments; 21. Requests the independent expert to seek the views and suggestions of States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, fund and programmes, regional economic commissions, international and regional financial institutions and non-governmental organizations on the general guidelines and his proposal of possible elements for consideration and urges them to respond to his requests; 21. 22. Decides to convene an expert consultation of three working days with the participation of experts from the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Health Organization and other relevant United Nations agencies, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the regional economic commissions, the international financial institutions, the special rapporteurs on economic, social and cultural rights, creditor and debtor States and non-governmental organizations to contribute to the independent expert’s work to finalize the general guidelines; 22. 23. Also decides to replace the phrase “effects of structural adjustment policies” by “effects of economic reform policies” in the title of the mandate of this current special 23. procedure; 24. Encourages the independent expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Commission and the Sub-Commission related to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, in his work towards the elaboration of the general guidelines; 24. 25. Requests the independent expert to report to the General Assembly on the issue of the effects of economic reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 25. 26.

Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to carry out his functions, as well as to facilitate his participation in and contribution to the follow-up process of the International Conference on Financing for Development, including in the multi-stakeholder consultations to be organized in 2005 on issues relevant to his mandate; 27. 28. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 28. 29. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 29. 30. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 30. 31.

political equality does not create an equal capacity to participate in political processes, or an equal capacity to influence decision-making processes, taking into consideration the existence of threats and obstacles that impede effective popular participation, Welcoming the commitment of all Member States, expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to work collectively for more inclusive political processes allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all countries, Welcoming also the pledge of the international community at the World Conference on Human Rights, held at

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures proposed or implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation for the last few years; 2. Welcomes the fact that the High Commissioner recently submitted a comprehensive proposal to the Office of Human Resources Management that will effectively discontinue the practice of hiring temporary staff for regular functions of the Office of the High Commissioner through the regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field to align the recruitment policy of the Office with that of the United Nations Secretariat; 3. Regrets that most of the measures described therein are not new and, as the statistics show, they are either inadequate or inadequately or insufficiently applied and they have failed to produce any concrete improvement in the geographical distribution of the staff of the Office to date, and that the report does not provide for specific targets and deadlines to be achieved in order to reduce the current imbalance in the staff, as requested in paragraph 23 (a) of Commission resolution 2004/73; 4. Expresses its concern that, while nationals of 30 out of 43 developed countries are represented in the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the overwhelming majority of developing countries, 102 out of 148, have not a single national on the staff of the Office, despite the fact that 13 out of 15 unrepresented countries and 6 out of the 5. Also expresses its concern that the number of nationals of most of the developed countries overrepresented, underrepresented or within range at the level of the whole Secretariat outnumber by many times the average number of nationals of individual developing countries represented on the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 6. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 7. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU/REP/2003/6) that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner; 8. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than in those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 9. Takes note with appreciation that the recommendations for the selection of staff for technical cooperation activities and advisory services will be subject to the review of the Office’s internal Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues and that the composition of the Panel has been reviewed to balance its geographical distribution, as requested by Commission resolution 2004/73, and requests the High Commissioner to ensure that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general and to report to the Commission on the current composition of the Panel; 10. Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from unrepresented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive 10. examinations; 11. Welcomes the statement in the report that the Office of the High Commissioner has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts, involving the screening of candidates at the initial recruitment stage, including of short-term staff, to ensure that, between equally qualified candidates, priority is given to candidates from such countries, but regrets that in the last year there has been a further increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from one regional group, enlarging the existing chronic geographical imbalance, and requests the High Commissioner to use the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 11. 12. Also welcomes the assurance of the High Commissioner that she attaches the utmost importance to equitable geographical representation, as well as to the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity on the part of the staff of her Office and the fact that the High Commissioner has paid particular attention to geographical diversity in the recruitment of the senior managers, since four out of seven posts subject to geographical distribution at the D-1 level and above are encumbered by staff from developing countries; 12. 13. Expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 13. discontinued; 14. Stresses that the proposal made in the last year by the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and is, therefore, unacceptable; 14. 15. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, 15. furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office at Geneva; 16. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 17. Also reiterates that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 17. 18. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 18. 19. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 19. 20. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 20. 21. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 21. 22. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 22. 23. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 23. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 24. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of her mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 24. 25. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 25. Requests the High Commissioner: 26. (a) To ensure that the one-time post regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field results in a new and balanced geographical distribution of the staff of the Office, advertising the posts to be regularized and filling them in a transparent and competitive manner, following United Nations practices and provisions; (b) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (c) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; (d) To use also the programmes and funds for technical cooperation and human rights education for the training of national technical personnel in developing countries and countries with economies in transition through the use of Junior Professional Officers from these countries, with a view to guaranteeing that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers and that every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; (e) To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-second session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 27. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 28. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights”, in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 28. 29. Recalls its request to the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other United Nations intergovernmental bodies regarding the management, programmes and administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; 29. Decides to consider this matter under the same agenda item at its 30. sixty-second session.

promoting and protecting human rights should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, Reaffirming that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, Recalling that at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development, Reaffirming that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, Taking into account that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures, Persuaded that social development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, friendly relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political systems, Reaffirming that the widening gap between the economically developed and developing countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, Expressing concern at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, particularly the least developed and the African countries, Expressing its deep concern over the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, Reaffirming the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized countries to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, Recognizing the need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of developing countries, Determined to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, Welcoming the solidarity and humanity expressed by the international community to the victims and the Governments of those States that suffered huge losses of life and socio-economic and environmental damage from the unprecedented tsunami disaster that struck the Indian Ocean and South-East Asian regions on 26 December 2004, Asserting the necessity for establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership and intragenerational solidarity, and for promoting intergenerational solidarity for the perpetuation of humankind, Recognizing that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, Resolved to strive to ensure that the present generations are fully aware of their responsibilities towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for the present and future generations, 1. Reaffirms the interdependence between the concepts of democracy, development, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; 2. Welcomes the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value of solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve help from those who benefit most; 3. Expresses its determination to contribute towards the solution of current world problems through increased international cooperation, to create such conditions as will ensure that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, and to hand on a better world to future generations; 4. Urges the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their endeavours for development and for the promotion of conditions that make possible the full realization of all human rights; 5. Recognizes that the so-called “third-generation rights” closely interrelated to the fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of international cooperation in this field; 6. Decides, taking into account the urgent need to further develop guidelines, standards, norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting rights closely interrelated to the fundamental value of solidarity, to appoint an independent expert on human rights and international solidarity for a period of three years; 7.

A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 Annex Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice We, the States Members of the United Nations, Having assembled at the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held in Bangkok from 18 to 25 April 2005, to decide to take more effective concerted action, in a spirit of cooperation, to combat crime and seek justice, Convinced that the United Nations congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice, which constitute a major intergovernmental forum, have contributed to national policies and practices by facilitating the exchange of views and experience, mobilizing public opinion and recommending policy options at the national, regional and international levels, thus making a significant contribution to progress and the promotion of international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice, Recalling the work of the ten previous United Nations congresses, Reaffirming the responsibility vested in the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme to work, together with Member States and regional and international organizations, in the fields of crime prevention and criminal justice, Greatly concerned by the expansion and dimensions of transnational organized crime, including illicit drug trafficking, money-laundering, trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, illegal arms trafficking and terrorism, and any existing links between them, and by the increasing sophistication and diversification of the activities of organized criminal groups, Emphasizing that enhancing dialogue among civilizations, promoting tolerance, preventing the indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures and addressing development issues and unresolved conflicts will contribute to international cooperation, which is among the most important elements to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and reaffirming that no terrorist act can be justified in any circumstances, Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law and should adopt such measures in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Alarmed by the rapid growth, geographical extent and effects of new economic and financial crimes, which have emerged as significant threats to national economies and the international financial system, Highlighting the need for an integrated and systemic approach to combating corruption and money-laundering, within existing frameworks and instruments, in particular those under the aegis of the United Nations, since those crimes can be conducive to the perpetration of other criminal activities, A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 Noting with appreciation the work of the regional preparatory meetings for the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,3 Declare as follows: 1. We proclaim our political will and commitment to achieve the aspirations and objectives as set out in this Declaration. 2. We reaffirm our continued support for and commitment to the United Nations and to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, especially the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and the institutes of the Programme network, and resolve to strengthen the Programme further through sustained funding, as appropriate. 3. In a spirit of common and shared responsibility, we reaffirm our readiness to seek to improve international cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism, at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels, in areas including extradition and mutual legal assistance. We seek to ensure our national capacity and, where appropriate, the coherence of our international capacity, through the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations, to engage in international cooperation, in particular in the prevention, investigation, prosecution and adjudication of transnational organized crime and terrorism and in discovering any existing links between them. 4. We welcome the entry into force of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two of its Protocols.# We call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to ratify or accede to and implement the provisions of that Convention and its Protocols, as well as the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption> and the international instruments against terrorism. In implementing the provisions of those instruments, we commit ourselves to full compliance with our obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. We support every effort to facilitate the implementation of those instruments. 5. We call upon donor States and financial institutions to continue to make adequate voluntary contributions on a regular basis for the provision of technical assistance to developing countries and to countries with economies in transition, in order to help build their capacity to prevent and tackle crime in all its forms and apply the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice and, in particular, to facilitate their becoming parties to and implementing the international instruments against terrorism and the relevant international instruments against crime, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the international drug control conventions. 6. We support a more integrated approach within the United Nations in relation to the provision of assistance for building capacity in crime prevention and 3 A/CONF.203/RPM.1/1, A/CONF.203/RPM.2/1, A/CONF.203/RPM.3/1 and Corr.1 and A/CONF.203/RPM.4/1. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 criminal justice, and in cooperation in criminal matters of a transnational character, as a contribution to the establishment and strengthening of the rule of law. 7. We seek to improve our responses to crime and terrorism nationally and internationally, inter alia, by collecting and sharing information on crime and terrorism and on effective countermeasures, in accordance with national legislation. We welcome the important work done by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network in the area of trends in crime and justice. 8. We are convinced that upholding the rule of law and good governance and proper management of public affairs and public property at the local, national and international levels are prerequisites for creating and sustaining an environment for successfully preventing and combating crime. We are committed to the development and maintenance of fair and efficient criminal justice institutions, including the humane treatment of all those in pre-trial and correctional facilities, in accordance with applicable international standards. 9. We recognize the role of individuals and groups outside the public sector, such as civil society, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, in contributing to the prevention of and the fight against crime and terrorism. We encourage measures to strengthen this role within the rule of law. 10. We recognize that comprehensive and effective crime prevention strategies can significantly reduce crime and victimization. We urge that such strategies address the root causes and risk factors of crime and victimization and that they be further developed and implemented at the local, national and international levels, taking into account, inter alia, the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime.® 11. We note that countries emerging from conflicts are particularly vulnerable to crime, in particular organized crime and corruption, and therefore we recommend that Member States, regional organizations and international entities such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in coordination with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat and other relevant entities, provide more effective responses to these problems, in order to re-establish, strengthen or sustain the rule of law and deliver justice in post-conflict situations. 12. With regard to the increased involvement of organized criminal groups in the theft of and trafficking in cultural property and illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna, we recognize the importance of combating these forms of crime and, bearing in mind the relevant international legal instruments, such as the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property,” the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora® and the Convention on Biological Diversity,” we call upon Member States to take effective measures to strengthen international cooperation. 6 Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. 7 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 823, No. 11806. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 13. We note with concern the rise of kidnapping and trafficking in persons as serious, profitable and inhumane forms of organized crime, often committed with the objective of funding criminal organizations and, in some cases, terrorist activities, and hence recommend that measures be devised to combat these crimes and that attention be given to the creation of practical mechanisms for countering them. We recognize the need to implement measures intended to provide adequate assistance and protection to victims of kidnapping and trafficking in persons and their families. 14. Mindful of General Assembly resolution 59/156 of 20 December 2004 on preventing, combating and punishing trafficking in human organs, we note the serious concerns raised about the illicit removal of and trafficking in human organs and will examine with interest the report of the Secretary-General requested in that resolution. 15. We reaffirm the fundamental importance of implementation of existing instruments and the further development of national measures and international cooperation in criminal matters, such as consideration of strengthening and augmenting measures, in particular against cybercrime, money-laundering and trafficking in cultural property, as well as on extradition, mutual legal assistance and the confiscation, recovery and return of proceeds of crime. 16. We note that, in the current period of globalization, information technology and the rapid development of new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the abuse of those technologies for criminal purposes. We therefore welcome efforts to enhance and supplement existing cooperation to prevent, investigate and prosecute high-technology and computer-related crime, including by developing partnerships with the private sector. We recognize the important contribution of the United Nations to regional and other international forums in the fight against cybercrime and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking into account that experience, to examine the feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the United Nations in partnership with other similarly focused organizations. 17. We recognize the importance of giving special attention to the need to protect witnesses and victims of crime and terrorism, and we commit ourselves to strengthening, where needed, the legal and financial framework for providing support to such victims, taking into account, inter alia, the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power.10 18. We call upon Member States to take steps, in accordance with their domestic laws, to promote access to justice, to consider the provision of legal aid to those who need it and to enable the effective assertion of their rights in the criminal justice system. 19. We note with concern the problem of trafficking in illicit drugs and the serious socio-economic consequences it entails, and therefore we call for the strengthening of international cooperation in combating that form of organized crime. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 20. We will strengthen international cooperation in order to create an environment that is conducive to the fight against crime, including by promoting growth and sustainable development and eradicating poverty and unemployment through effective and balanced development strategies and crime prevention policies. 21. We call upon States that have not yet done so to become parties to and implement the universal instruments against terrorism. In order to enhance the capacity of States to become parties to and implement those instruments and to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism, we express our support for the continuing efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, within its mandate and in coordination with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate of the Security Council, to assist States in their efforts to ratify and implement those instruments, through the provision of technical assistance upon request. This might include assistance to criminal justice systems to facilitate the effective implementation of those instruments. 22. We express the hope that the ongoing negotiation of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism will be concluded as soon as possible. In this context, we recognize that arriving at a possible definition of terrorism is one of the key issues to be resolved. We call upon Member States to consider signing and ratifying the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.!! 23. We are convinced that the expeditious entry into force and subsequent implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption!2 are central to the efforts at the international level to fight corruption, and therefore we accord high priority to supporting efforts to that end, and we call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to sign, ratify or accede to it. 24. We are also convinced that the proper management of public affairs and public property and the rule of law are essential to the prevention and control of corruption, including, inter alia, through effective measures for its investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, we recognize that, in order to curb corruption, it is necessary to promote a culture of integrity and accountability in both the public and the private sector. 25. We are convinced that asset recovery is one of the essential components of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and, for that reason, we emphasize the need to adopt measures to facilitate asset recovery that are consistent with the principles of that convention. 26. We are conscious of the challenge of investigating and prosecuting complex cases involving economic and financial crimes, including money- laundering. We call upon Member States to strengthen policies, measures and institutions for national action and international cooperation in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic and financial crimes, including money- laundering, and such crimes conducted via, or facilitated by, information technologies, in particular in connection with the financing of terrorism and trafficking in illicit drugs. 11 General Assembly resolution 59/290, annex. 12 General Assembly resolution 58/4, annex. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 27. We are conscious of the crucial importance of tackling document and identity fraud in order to curb organized crime and terrorism. We seek to improve international cooperation, including through technical assistance, to combat document and identity fraud, in particular the fraudulent use of travel documents, through improved security measures, and encourage the adoption of appropriate national legislation. 28. We recommend that voluntary contributions and appropriate technical assistance be made available to developing countries, to strengthen their capacity in order to support their efforts to fight economic and financial crimes effectively. 29. As appropriate, we endeavour to use and apply the United Nations standards and norms in our national programmes for crime prevention and criminal justice reform and to undertake, as needed, efforts to ensure their wider dissemination. We endeavour to facilitate appropriate training for law enforcement officials, including prison officials, prosecutors, the judiciary and other relevant professional groups, taking into account those norms and standards and best practices at the international level. 30. We recommend that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice give consideration to reviewing the adequacy of standards and norms in relation to prison management and prisoners. 31. We note with concern that the physical and social conditions associated with imprisonment may facilitate the spread of HIV/AIDS in pre-trial and correctional facilities and thus in society, thereby presenting a critical prison management problem; we call upon States to develop and adopt measures and guidelines, where appropriate and in accordance with national legislation, to ensure that the particular problems of HIV/AIDS are adequately addressed in such facilities. 32. To promote the interests of victims and the rehabilitation of offenders, we recognize the importance of further developing restorative justice policies, procedures and programmes that include alternatives to prosecution, thereby avoiding possible adverse effects of imprisonment, helping to decrease the caseload of criminal courts and promoting the incorporation of restorative justice approaches into criminal justice systems, as appropriate. 33. We affirm our determination to pay particular attention to juvenile justice. We will consider ways to ensure the provision of services to children who are victims of crime and children in conflict with law, in particular those deprived of their liberty, and to ensure that those services take into account their gender, social circumstances and developmental needs and the relevant United Nations standards and norms, as appropriate. 34. We stress the need to consider measures to prevent the expansion of urban crime, including by improving international cooperation and capacity- building for law enforcement and the judiciary in that area and by promoting the involvement of local authorities and civil society. 35. We express our profound gratitude to the people and the Government of Thailand for their warm and generous hospitality towards the participants and for the excellent facilities provided for the Eleventh Congress.",10/18/2005,2005_558873,Democratic Republic of the Congo,N/A,yes
