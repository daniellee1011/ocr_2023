Notes with concern that, according to the report of the International Labour Organization Women at Work: Trends 2016, women’s labour force participation in 2015 is estimated to be 49.6 per cent globally compared with 76.1 per cent for men, and that women workers are disproportionately represented in the informal economy as well as non- standard forms of employment, such as part-time and temporary contracts or self- employment, which can on many occasions compromise their job security, working conditions and social protection; and that in developing countries, the share of women in underemployment exceeds that of men; 15. Expresses deep concern that inequalities are widening and there are not enough jobs, including quality jobs, to keep up with a growing labour force and, bearing in mind the fundamental importance of equal opportunities, education and vocational training in the context of realizing the right to work, emphasizes that full and productive employment and decent work for young people play an important role in their empowerment and can contribute to, inter alia, the prevention of extremism, terrorism and social, economic and political instability; A/HRC/34/L.22 16.

Calls upon States to continue their efforts to prevent and combat all forms of discrimination and violence, including sexual harassment at the workplace, including by adopting and implementing laws and policies and through training, awareness-raising and support for women’s access to justice with respect to violence and sexual harassment, bearing in mind that these continue to be among the factors that have an adverse impact on the realization of the right to work for women; 29. Encourages States to take all appropriate measures to prohibit discrimination in all matters concerning access to employment and job opportunities, including in relation to equal conditions of pay, hiring and career advancement, and to pay particular attention to women facing multiple and intersecting forms of inequality and discrimination and women in vulnerable situations, including women with disabilities whose labour rights are often violated; 30.

Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be

has increased significantly in the digital age, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Emphasizing also that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect personal data and when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including business enterprises, Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the Guiding Principles

while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption and anonymity, can be important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Emphasizing also that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment is important to the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to privacy, Noting that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age may affect all individuals, including with particular effects on women, as well as children and persons in vulnerable situations, or marginalized

suffer insecurity as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities, Noting that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular

the impact of climate change, the unsustainable management and use of natural resources, the unsound management of chemicals and waste, the resulting loss of biodiversity and the decline in services provided by ecosystems may interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing further the importance of gender equality, the empowerment of women and the role women play as managers of natural resources and agents of change in the safeguarding of the environment, Recognizing that, while the human rights implications of environmental damage are felt by individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, Recognizing also that degradation and loss of biodiversity often result from and reinforce existing patterns of discrimination, and that environmental harm can have disastrous, and at times geographically dispersed consequences on the quality of life of A/HRC/34/L.33 indigenous peoples, local communities, peasants and others who rely directly on the products of forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans for their food, fuel and medicine, resulting in further inequality and marginalization, Acknowledging that wetlands are the ecosystem with the highest rate of loss and degradation, and aware that indicators of current trends suggest that pressure on biodiversity and wetlands will increase in the years to come, Recognizing the key role that wetlands play in maintaining water quantity and quality, among other things, and recalling General Assembly resolutions 68/157 of 18 December 2013 and 70/169 of 17 December 2015 on safe drinking water and sanitation, which are essential for the full enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing also the need to change human development patterns, behaviour and activities to respect nature as a fundamental condition for the well-being of all forms of life, which depend on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and the ecosystem services it underpins, and in this regard, recalling Goal 12 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, and target 12.1 on implementing the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, 1.

of the child, Recognizing that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing and protection of children, in the best interests of the child, and that children, for the full and harmonious development of their personality, should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, Noting with appreciation the work to promote and protect the rights of the child carried out by all relevant organs, bodies, entities and organizations of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates, by relevant mandate holders and special procedures of the United Nations and by relevant regional organizations, where appropriate, and intergovernmental organizations, and recognizing the valuable role of national human rights institutions and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, Noting the convening of international, regional and national meetings aimed at eliminating all forms of violence against children, including all violent punishment of children, and encouraging additional efforts in this regard, Recognizing the importance of international, regional and _ bilateral multi-stakeholder partnerships and initiatives to advance the effective protection and promotion of the rights of the child and the elimination of violence against children, and in this regard takes note, inter alia, of the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children, the “High time to end violence against children” initiative, the Together for Girls partnership, the Global Alliance to Eradicate Forced Labour, Modern Slavery, Human Trafficking and Child Labour, the Global Youth Partnership for the Sustainable Development Goals, the Global Partnership on Children with Disabilities, the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, the WeProtect Global Alliance to combat online child sexual exploitation and the Global Alliance for Reporting Progress on Promoting Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies, Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical, in an increasingly globalized environment, as a result of the persistence of poverty, social inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, fetal alcohol syndrome and inherited addictions, non-communicable diseases, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, environmental damage, climate change, natural disasters, armed conflict, foreign occupation, displacement, famine, violence, terrorism, abuse, all forms of exploitation, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, such as for purposes of child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, child sex tourism and sexual exploitation of children in travel, and trafficking in children, including for purposes of labour and sexual exploitation, organ removal and the transfer of organs of the child for profit, neglect, illiteracy, hunger, intolerance, discrimination, racism, xenophobia, gender inequality, inadequate protection and inadequate access to justice, and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for, Profoundly concerned also that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of the world financial and economic crisis, poverty and inequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, recognizing its impact beyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable development, in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation of the 4/16 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence and to promote the resilience of children, their families and their communities, Profoundly concerned further that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the impacts of climate change, including persistent drought and extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and in this regard underlines the importance of the implementation of the Paris Agreement* adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Expressing deep concern that, despite the recognition of the right of the child to express her or his views freely on all matters affecting her or him, with her or his views given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, children are still seldom seriously consulted and involved in such matters owing to a variety of constraints and impediments and that the full implementation of this right has yet to be fully realized, Deeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of discrimination, exclusion, inequality and poverty, Deeply concerned also that approximately 5.6 million children under the age of 5 die each year,’ mostly
