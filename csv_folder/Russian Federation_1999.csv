irreparable loss of human lives, Concerned that demand for, production of and trafficking in illicit drugs and psychotropic substances continue to seriously threaten the socio-economic and political systems, stability, national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States, especially those involved in conflicts and wars, and that trafficking in drugs could make conflict resolution more difficult, Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug-trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money-laundering and illicit traffic in arms, precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing the need for international cooperation and implementation of effective strategies on the basis of the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, which are essential to achieving results against all forms of transnational criminal activities, Deeply convinced that the special session made a significant contribution to a new comprehensive framework for international cooperation, based on an integrated and balanced approach with strategies, measures, methods, practical activities, goals and specific targets to be met, that all States, the United Nations system and other international organizations

world drug problem in their programmes, taking into account the priorities of States, Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, can make an effective contribution to and should play an active role in addressing the world drug problem, Emphasizing the importance of the adoption of the Action Plan for the Implementation ofthe Declaration on the Guiding Principles of

use of drugs and at reducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse, ensuring that special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, particularly youth, and constitutes one of the pillars of the new global strategy and an important initiative of the United Nations Decade against Drug Abuse, 1991-2000, and reaffirming the need for demand reduction programmes, Emphasizing equally the importance of

produce narcotic drugs for scientific and medical purposes, and of the International Narcotics Control Board in preventing the diversion of such substances toillicit markets and in maintaining production at a level consistent with licit demand, in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971,° Acknowledging that there are

development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production, Stressing that respect for all human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem, Ensuring that women and men benefit equally, and without any discrimination, from strategies directed against the world drug problem, through their involvement in all stages of programmes and policy-making, Recognizing that the use of the Internet poses new opportunities and challenges to international cooperation in combating drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking, and further recognizing the need for increased cooperation among States and the exchange of information, including with reference to national experiences, on how to counteract the promotion of drug abuse and the illicit drug trafficking through this instrument and on ways to use the Internet for information concerning drug demand reduction, I Respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and international law in the fight against the world drug problem 1.
