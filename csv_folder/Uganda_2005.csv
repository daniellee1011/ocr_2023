Takes note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the use of mercenaries as a means of impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination, Ms. Shaista Shameem (E/CN.4/2005/14) commends the Special Rapporteur for her valuable work in the fulfilment of her mandate; 2.

2005,Economic And Social Council,Commission On Human Rights,Sixty-first session,10,"ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS","Angola*, Bangladesh*, Bolivia*, Botswana*, Burkina Faso, Burundi*, Cameroon*, Cote d’Ivoire*, Cuba, China, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea*, Democratic Republic of the Congo*, Ecuador, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Myanmar*, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda*, Sudan, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic*, Togo, Tunisia*, Uganda*, United Republic of Tanzania*, Uruguay*, Viet Nam*, Zambia*, Zimbabwe",2005,Effects of economic reform and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights,"The Commission on Human Rights, Recalling its previous resolutions on this matter, in particular resolution 2004/18 of 16 April 2004, Recalling also that the purpose of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the full promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration can be fully realized and that in the United Nations Millennium Declaration all States resolved to respect fully and uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Stressing that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, Emphasizing that the World Conference on Human Rights agreed to call upon the international community to make all efforts to help alleviate the external debt burden of developing countries in order to supplement the efforts of the Governments of such countries to attain the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights of their people, Stressing the determination expressed in the Millennium Declaration to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income developing countries, through various national and international measures designed to make their debt sustainable in the long term, Noting that the total debt stock of the developing countries rose from 1,421 billion United States dollars in 1990 to 2,384 billion dollars in 2002, Noting also that, in 2002, developing countries as a whole made net outward transfers of financial resources for the sixth consecutive year, Acknowledging that there is greater acceptance that the increasing debt burden faced by the most indebted developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, is unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people-centred sustainable development and poverty eradication and that for many developing countries, as well as countries with economies in transition, excessive debt servicing has severely constrained their capacity to promote social development and provide basic services to realize economic, social and cultural rights, Expressing its concern that, despite repeated rescheduling of debt, developing countries continue to pay out more each year than the actual amount they receive in official development assistance, Affirming that the debt burden further complicates the numerous problems facing developing countries, contributes to extreme poverty, is an obstacle to sustainable human development and is thus a serious impediment to the realization of all human rights, 1. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (E/CN.4/2005/42), and stresses that structural adjustment reform programmes have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Welcomes the proposals of the independent expert for elements of basic principles and for action at the national and international levels in the development of general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making on and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, and encourages the independent expert to continue to take into account in this regard the relevant past and new initiatives of the General Assembly, the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, social and cultural development of its people, and to this end has the right and responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 4. Recognizes that the structural adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, imposing fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 5. Expresses its concern at the fact that the options for macroeconomic policy of developing countries are constrained by demands for adjustment and that many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still carry very high external debt burdens relative to their gross national product; 6. Also expresses its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of the overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-term debt burden; 7. Reiterates its conviction that for the heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers in the form of grants and concessional loans, as well as removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 8. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of middle-income and low-income heavily indebted countries, and that until now there has been little headway made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor within them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected recently by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, as well as by armed conflicts; 9. Acknowledges that in the least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals regarding development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 10. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official 10. development assistance; 11. Recalls once again the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 11. 12. Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, and the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 12. 13. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration contained in the annex to resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 13. 14. Stresses the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of human rights; 14. 15. Also stresses that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to overall realization of all human rights; 15. 16. Further stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 16. 17. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting the 17. ongoing programmes; 18. Reaffirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 18. 19. Requests the independent expert to explore further, in his analytical annual report to the Commission, the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 19. 20. Recalls its requests to the independent expert, in the discharge of his mandate, to present to the Commission at its sixty- second session a final of general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making on and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, 20. including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure that compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as provided for in the international human rights instruments; 21. Requests the independent expert to seek the views and suggestions of States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, fund and programmes, regional economic commissions, international and regional financial institutions and non-governmental organizations on the general guidelines and his proposal of possible elements for consideration and urges them to respond to his requests; 21. 22. Decides to convene an expert consultation of three working days with the participation of experts from the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Health Organization and other relevant United Nations agencies, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the regional economic commissions, the international financial institutions, the special rapporteurs on economic, social and cultural rights, creditor and debtor States and non-governmental organizations to contribute to the independent expert’s work to finalize the general guidelines; 22. 23. Also decides to replace the phrase “effects of structural adjustment policies” by “effects of economic reform policies” in the title of the mandate of this current special 23. procedure; 24. Encourages the independent expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Commission and the Sub-Commission related to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, in his work towards the elaboration of the general guidelines; 24. 25. Requests the independent expert to report to the General Assembly on the issue of the effects of economic reform policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 25. 26. Also requests the independent expert to exchange views with the Sub-Commission expert charged with preparing a working paper on the effects of debt on human 26. rights; 27. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to carry out his functions, as well as to facilitate his participation in and contribution to the follow-up process of the International Conference on Financing for Development, including in the multi-stakeholder consultations to be organized in 2005 on issues relevant to his mandate; 27. 28. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 28. 29. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 29. 30. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 30. 31. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 31. Decides to continue the consideration of this matter at its sixty-second session 32. under the same agenda item.",04/12/2005,2005_545720,Uganda,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council.",yes

resolutions on this issue, Recalling also General Assembly resolution 55/96 of 4 December 2000 and recalling its own resolution 2000/47 of 25 April 2000 on promoting and consolidating democracy, Reaffirming its commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming also the commitment of all States to fulfil their obligations to promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, other instruments relating to human rights, and international law, Stressing that all peoples have the right to self-determination, by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development, Recognizing that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing, Recalling that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming the commitment made by Member States to strive for the full protection and promotion in all our States of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for all, Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for a democratic, participatory and fair international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including promoting and encouraging respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, rule of law, pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity, Recognizing that granting all people formal political equality does not create an equal capacity to participate in political processes, or an equal capacity to influence decision-making processes, taking into consideration the existence of threats and obstacles that impede effective popular participation, Welcoming the commitment of all Member States, expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, to work collectively for more inclusive political processes allowing genuine participation by all citizens in all countries, Welcoming also the pledge of the international community at the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna in June 1993, to support the strengthening and promotion of democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the world, Recalling the commitment of States, expressed in the Declaration of Principles adopted by the World Summit on the Information Society in December 2003, to ensure that everyone can benefit from the opportunities offered by information and communication technologies, so that all citizens in every country can participate actively in, and benefit fully from, the information society, Recognizing that the equal participation of all individuals and peoples in the formation of just, equitable, democratic and inclusive societies can contribute to a world free from racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Emphasizing the importance of the equitable participation of all, without any discrimination, in domestic as well as global decision-making, Considering that in the current context of globalization, whereby decisions affecting people’s lives are often taken outside the national context, the application of the principles of democracy to the international and regional levels has taken on added importance, Recognizing that development can only be sustainable on a long-term basis if development policies are responsive to people’s needs and ensure people’s participation both in their design and implementation, while stressing the fact that meeting the basic human needs essential for survival is a sine qua non condition for an effective democracy, Emphasizing that poverty, inequalities and discrimination constitute major threats to democracy and inhibit the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and the participation of all citizens in the democratic processes in every society, Emphasizing also that the full participation of everyone in democratic societies fosters and enhances the struggle against poverty, inequities and discrimination, Recognizing that the electoral regime is a basic and fundamental element of democracy, but that democracy involves more than the mere holding of elections, as it also depends on an effective response to people’s well-being, Reaffirming the need to create an environment - at the national and global levels alike - which is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty, Recalling that accountable and transparent governance at the national and international levels is critical for the creation of an environment that facilitates the development of democratic, prosperous and peaceful societies,

affairs covers all aspects of public administration and the formulation and implementation of policy at the international, regional, national and local levels, Recognizing and respecting the rich and diverse nature of the community of the world’s democracies, which arise out of all of the world’s social, cultural and religious beliefs and traditions, Bearing in mind that each society and every context has its own indigenous and relevant democratic institutional traditions, and that while no single institution can claim democratic perfection, the combination of domestic democratic structures with universal democratic norms is a formidable tool in strengthening both the roots and the reach of democracy and in advancing a universal understanding of democracy, Recognizing that while all democracies share common features, differences between democratic societies should be neither feared nor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity, Aware of the importance of fostering a diversity of social contributions in strengthening people’s participation, equity, social justice and non-discrimination, including the enhancement of non-governmental organizations, people’s organizations, voluntary social organizations, trade unions, the private sector and other actors of civil society, Aware also of the importance of ensuring the implementation of the rights to freedom

Also reaffirms that while all democracies share common features, there is no one model of democracy; therefore we must not seek to export any particular model of democracy; 4. Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone, both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development; 5.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 17. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, A/C.3/61/L.27 while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 19.
