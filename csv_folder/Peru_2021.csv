likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impact of global

to chemicals, toxic substances and waste, and loss of biodiversity, and that environmental harm may interfere with the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, Mindful that the growing risk of emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin may be caused by human actions that damage ecosystems and biodiversity, stressing that biodiversity is important for the enjoyment of a wide range of human rights, and expressing concern that the loss of biodiversity caused by human activities can be threatening to the enjoyment of those rights and have a major impact on health and livelihoods, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and promote human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental challenges, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, as recognized in different international instruments and reflected in the framework principles on human rights and the environment,? and that additional measures for those

Convention on Climate Change, in which they acknowledged in the preamble that they should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations with regard to human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, the empowerment of women and intergenerational equity, Recalling further the importance of women’s and indigenous peoples’ rights to have access to and to use land to increase opportunities for climate change adaption and mitigation, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Climate Change and Land and as set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Noting the Secretary-General’s Call to Action for Human Rights, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Taking note of the outcomes of the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and

environmental harm can have disastrous and at times geographically dispersed consequences for the quality of life of indigenous peoples, local communities, peasants and others who rely directly on the products of forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans for their food, fuel and medicine, resulting in further inequality and marginalization, Recognizing also that sustainable development and the

standard of physical and mental health, to an adequate standard of living, to adequate food, to safe drinking water and sanitation and to housing, and cultural rights, Recognizing further that, conversely, the impact of climate change, the unsustainable management and use of natural resources, the pollution of air, land and water, the unsound management of chemicals and waste, the resulting loss of biodiversity and the decline in services provided by ecosystems may interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing that, while the human rights implications of environmental damage are felt by individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, as well as women and girls, Recognizing also the benefits of seeking to mitigate and minimize the negative effects of pollution and other forms of environmental degradation in situations of armed conflict and post-conflict contexts, and expressing its deep concern at the threats posed to the effective enjoyment of human rights by persons in vulnerable situations, including children, women A/HRC/46/L.6 and girls, youth, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous peoples, local communities, refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants, Recognizing further that the exercise of human rights, including the freedom to

safe and sustainable environment, Reaffirming Human Rights Council resolution 40/11 of 21 March 2019, in which the Council recognized the contribution of human rights defenders working in environmental matters, referred to as environmental human rights defenders, to the enjoyment of human rights, environmental protection and sustainable development, urges all States to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of the rights and safety of all persons, including environmental human rights defenders, and underscores the responsibility of all business enterprises,

sustainable world while investing to maintain and resuscitate economies hit by the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and welcoming the work of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment in engaging and consulting with children, Recognizing also the importance of gender equality, gender-responsive action to address climate change and environmental degradation, the empowerment, leadership, decision-making and meaningful participation of women and girls, and the role women play as managers, leaders and defenders of natural resources and agents of change in safeguarding the environment, Recognizing further the particular vulnerability of children to the effects of environmental harm, including to air pollution, water pollution, climate change, exposure to chemicals, toxic substances and waste, and loss of biodiversity, and that environmental harm may interfere with the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, Mindful that the growing risk of emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin may be caused by human actions that damage ecosystems and biodiversity, stressing that biodiversity is important for the enjoyment of a wide range of human rights, and expressing concern that the loss of biodiversity, as a consequence of damage to the environment caused by human activities, can be threatening to the enjoyment of those rights and have a major impact on health and livelihoods, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and promote human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental challenges, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, as recognized in different international instruments and reflected in the framework principles on human rights and the environment,? and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to environmental harm should be taken, Noting that more than 155 States have recognized some form of a right to a healthy environment in, inter alia, international agreements or their national constitutions, legislation or policies, 1.

Emphasizes that, in the context of assemblies, police and other law enforcement officials play a key role in enabling and upholding the right of peaceful assembly and the rights to freedom of expression and of association, and urges all States to ensure that police and other law enforcement officials avoid using force during assemblies, and to ensure that, where force is absolutely necessary, no one is subject to excessive or indiscriminate use of force; 14. Affirms that police and other law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or in defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives; 15.

Encourages all States to ensure that police and other law enforcement officials charged with or under official investigation of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have no involvement in the custody, interrogation or treatment of any person under arrest, detention, imprisonment or other deprivation of liberty while such charges are pending and, if such persons are convicted, after the conviction; 21.

Stresses that States must ensure that no statement or evidence that is established to have been obtained as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement or evidence was obtained, urges States to extend that prohibition to statements or evidence obtained as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and recognizes that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 23. Emphasizes that, in order for police and other law enforcement officials to be able to play their role in safeguarding the right not to be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, States should ensure the proper functioning of the criminal justice system, in particular by taking effective measures to combat corruption, ensure due process, establish proper legal aid programmes, provide for the adequate selection, training, remuneration and equipment of law enforcement officials while fully respecting the principle of non-discrimination, and take measures to improve the representation of women and persons belonging to minorities within law enforcement ranks whenever possible; 24.

render schools legitimate targets of attack, thus endangering children’s and teachers’ safety as well as children’s education, Noting with concern the threats posed to civilian infrastructure, including that which supports essential services to the civilian population, by the use of any means or methods of warfare in violation of international humanitarian law, and the potentially devastating humanitarian impact of such use in situations of armed conflict, Noting that armed conflicts, violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and

specific vulnerabilities including persons with disabilities and older persons, including through increased risk of violence and lack of access to essential services, and stressing the protection and assistance needs of all affected civilian populations, Recalling its practice that mandates of UN peacekeeping and other relevant missions include, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis,

and recalling all other resolutions of the Council on the right to education, the most recent of which is resolution 44/3 of 16 July 2020, and also the resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on the subject, Bearing in mind the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training and the World Programme for Human Rights Education, which both underline the importance of human rights education as an integral part of the right to education, GE.21-09154(E) A/HRC/47/L.4 Expressing concern that, in spite of the progress achieved in the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 4, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, there are still 773 million adults who are not literate, two thirds of whom are women, and 258 million children, adolescents and youth who do not attend school, and that, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund, 50 per cent of pre- primary-age children around the world — at least 175 million — are not enrolled in pre-primary education, Recalling the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030 — towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, adopted at the World Education Forum 2015, held in Incheon, Republic of Korea, which aims to mobilize all countries and partners and provide guidance on achieving the effective implementation of Sustainable

outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development for ensuring the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals, Reaffirming the

especially economic and technical, to the maximum of available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights by all appropriate means, in particular the adoption of legislative measures, Expressing deep concern about the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the right to education for all, taking into account that more than 1.5 billion learners have been affected by the closure of educational institutions worldwide, Expressing concern also that, despite the tremendous efforts made by States and other stakeholders, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected those in the most vulnerable and marginalized situations, including in particular girls and women, persons with disabilities, persons living in poverty, migrants, asylum seekers, refugees, stateless and internally displaced persons and students in developing countries, and has exposed and exacerbated the entrenched structural inequalities in the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education, Reiterating the importance of early childhood development as a valuable foundation of lifelong learning and the entire education system, and the need to invest in early childhood education and care, Strongly condemning the recurring attacks on students, teachers, schools and universities, and the military use of educational facilities, which impair the realization of the right to education and cause severe and long-lasting harm to individuals and societies, Recognizing the negative impact of climate change, natural disasters, conflict and crisis on the full realization of the right to education, the fact that a large proportion of the world’s out-of-school population lives in conflict-affected areas, and that crises, violence and attacks on and the military use of educational institutions, natural disasters and pandemics continue to disrupt education and development globally, Recognizing also that girls are disproportionately represented among out-of-school children and that women are disproportionately represented among illiterate adults owing to, inter alia, gender-based discrimination and violence, including sexual violence and harassment; lack of a safe learning environment; child, early or forced marriage or unplanned pregnancy; the lack of appropriate water and sanitation facilities and menstrual health and hygiene supplies; discriminatory laws; gender stereotypes; patriarchal social norms; lack of empowerment, including on economic grounds, especially when education is not free; and discrimination based on any other grounds, such as race, colour, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, migration or other status, A/HRC/47/L.4 Recognizing further the role that access to information and communications technology, including the Internet, plays in facilitating the realization of the right to education and in promoting inclusive quality education, in particular in situations of emergencies, and recalling its important role during the COVID-19 pandemic, when on-site education has had to be suspended, Expressing concern at the inequalities in access to information and communications technology, which have increased the digital divides and expanded technological gaps, including but not limited to those based on gender, age, disability and migration or refugee status, and with their negative impact on the realization of the right to education, Stressing in this respect that the incorporation of digital technologies in education, notwithstanding its potential to expand and complement access to education, is not a long- term replacement for on-site schooling, and the need for a thorough debate on the role of digital technologies in education, keeping in mind not only equality of opportunities, including for conflict-affected areas, but also its potential unintended negative effects, including on children’s and young persons’ health, education and interpersonal development, the changes it may create in the organization of education systems and the potential to serve as an equalizer for marginalized children and young persons, Reaffirming that the human rights principles of non-discrimination and equality are central to the full realization of the right to education as enshrined in the Convention against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and emphasizing that everyone is entitled to the right to education without discrimination of any kind, Noting that education systems should nurture cultural diversity with a view to protecting cultural rights and fostering mutual understanding, respect for diversity and tolerance, Welcoming the steps taken to fully realize the right to education, such as the enactment of appropriate legislation, adjudication by national courts, the development of national indicators, and ensuring justiciability of this right, and aware of the role that communications procedures at the regional and international levels can play in promoting the justiciability of the right to education, Noting the development by experts of guiding principles and tools for States, such as the Abidjan principles on the human rights obligations of States to provide public education and to regulate private involvement in education, Noting also the efforts aimed at promoting and protecting the right to education and facilitating continuation of education in armed conflict, including the efforts of States that are signatories to the Safe Schools Declaration, 1. Urges all States to give full effect to the right to education by, inter alia, complying with their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to education by all appropriate means and without discrimination of any kind; 2. Calls upon all States to take all measures to implement Human Rights Council resolutions on the right to education with a view to ensuring the full realization of this right for all; 3.

Further calls upon States to continue to strengthen the protection of preschools, schools and universities against attacks, making them free from all forms of violence, including by taking measures to deter the military use of schools, such as by considering implementing the Guidelines for Protecting schools and universities from military use during armed conflict, and encourages efforts to provide safe, non-violent inclusive, effective and enabling learning environments and quality education for all within an appropriate time frame, including all levels of education in the context of humanitarian emergencies and conflict situations; 9. Calls upon States to accelerate efforts to eliminate gender-based discrimination, harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage, and all forms of violence abuse and harassment, including moral and sexual harassment, school-related sexual and gender-based violence, and bullying in schools and other educational settings both online and offline, in particular against those groups of persons who are most vulnerable, discriminated against and marginalized, and to guarantee gender equality and the right to education for all; 10.

infections, enabling legal and policy environments and full access to comprehensive information and education, Welcoming the recent reduction in the rate of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths achieved in some regions, while noting with continued concern that progress against the HIV epidemic is uneven across regions, countries and populations, that in some parts of the world new HIV infections are increasing and access to HIV-related prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and support remains limited, and that those most in need of HIV services continue to be left behind, Noting with grave concern that, in spite of such progress in the response to the HIV epidemic, approximately 37.6 million people are living with HIV globally, 16 per cent of people living with HIV are unaware of their HIV status, and an estimated 10.1 million people living with HIV still do not have access to treatment, owing in part to inequalities, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and structural barriers, Concerned that, despite the availability of the knowledge and tools necessary to prevent every new HIV infection and each AIDS-related death, the international community failed to meet the 2020 targets set out in the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS adopted by the General Assembly in 2016 and that inequalities in multiple forms and dimensions

level, education, occupation, geographic disparities, migratory status and incarceration and often overlap to compound each other, Recognizing that women, adolescents and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including care and support for those living with or affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this burden negatively affects girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Concerned at the continuing high prevalence of HIV among key populations, who are more likely to be exposed to HIV or to transmit it, Noting that, depending on the epidemiological and social context of a particular country, other populations may be at elevated risk of HIV, including women and adolescent girls and their male partners, young people, children, persons with disabilities, ethnic and racial minorities, indigenous peoples, local communities, people living in poverty, migrants, refugees, internally displaced persons and people in humanitarian emergencies and conflict and post-conflict situations, A/HRC/47/L.15 Concerned that stigma, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, violence and abuse against all persons living with, presumed to be living with, at risk of or affected by HIV, including key populations, and restrictive and discriminatory laws and practices that target those persons can hinder access to HIV services and increase risks of infection with HIV, perpetuating the global AIDS epidemic, Recognizing the critical role and space of civil society, including communities, affected populations and community-led and community-based organizations, and the active involvement of persons living with, at risk of or affected by HIV and other relevant civil society, academic and private sector stakeholders, as a catalyst for rights-based and evidence- informed responses to HIV, and recognizing the long-standing contribution of these groups to the global response to AIDS, Recognizing also the need to tackle health inequities and inequalities within and among countries through political commitment, international cooperation and policies, including those that address the social, economic and environmental determinants of health, Reaffirming the right to use, to the fullest extent, the provisions contained in the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), which provides flexibilities for the protection of public health and promotes access to medicines for all, in particular for developing countries, and in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, which recognizes that intellectual property protection is important for the development of new medicines and also recognizes the concerns about its effects on prices, 1. Affirms that respect for and the protection and fulfilment of human rights in the context of HIV, including universal access to HIV-related prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and support, are an essential element in achieving the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and in ending AIDS; 2.

Urges States to fulfil their commitment to ensuring global accessibility, availability and affordability of safe, effective and quality-assured medicines, including generics, vaccines, diagnostics and other health technologies to prevent, diagnose and treat HIV infection and its co-infections and comorbidities, by urgently removing, where feasible, all barriers, including those related to regulations, policies and practices that hamper access to health technologies and objectives, and promoting the utilization of all available tools to reduce prices of health technologies and costs associated with lifelong chronic care and to promote fair and equitable allocation of health products among and within countries to advance efforts to safeguard the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 30. Calls upon the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and its co- sponsor organizations to support countries in addressing the legal, social, economic, political and structural drivers of the AIDS epidemic, including through the promotion of all human rights and of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 31.

eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 5, in particular targets 5.2 and 5.3, and the commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 16, and taking into account the commitment to leave no one behind, Acknowledging the important role played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities, including women and girls with disabilities of African and Asian descent, are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Condemning the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and recognizing the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as facing barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, Stressing that States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent health-care services, maternal health-care services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HI'V and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services can violate, abuse or impair the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Recognizing that information and communications technologies, including assistive technology and devices, have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can create conditions enabling the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and can contribute to their social and digital inclusion and digital literacy, empowerment and autonomy, and allow them to live independently on an equal basis with others and to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in society and in the world of work, while condemning all forms of violence against women and girls with disabilities in digital contexts, including new forms of violence such as cyberviolence, bullying and harassment, and their rising prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic, Recognizing also the major contribution made by civil society, including women’s and girls’ rights and community-based organizations, organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, older women, girls and youth, feminist groups, women and girl human rights defenders and disability inclusion advocates, and recognizing further the importance of having open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment and domestic violence, by, A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 inter alia, providing for a supportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, including by raising awareness about the human rights of all women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing further that domestic violence is not a private family matter and must be eliminated, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, 1. Expresses outrage at the persistence and pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide; 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms all forms of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in the context of lockdown measures and school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 3. Expresses deep concern that all forms of discrimination and violence impair or nullify the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which hinders the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others in the economic, social, cultural, civil and political spheres, and is an impediment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 4. Stresses the need to strengthen efforts to empower women and girls with disabilities and enhance their participation and promote their leadership in society by taking measures to address all barriers that prevent or restrict their full and equal participation and inclusion in all spheres of life, including through the creation of enabling programmes, community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes, ensure their access, on an equal basis with others, to economic and financial resources and disability-inclusive and accessible social infrastructure, transportation, justice mechanisms and services, in particular in relation to health and education, as well as productive employment and decent work for women with disabilities, and ensure that the priorities and rights of women and girls with disabilities are fully incorporated into policies and programmes and that they are closely consulted and actively involved in decision-making processes; 5. Also stresses the need to address multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, which place women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, violence and abuse, and to implement measures to prevent and eliminate stereotypes based on disability, gender, age, race and xenophobia, ableism, stigma, negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that cause or perpetuate discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Recognizes that a proactive multisectoral approach, working with all relevant stakeholders, including organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, is required to prevent, respond to and eliminate violence against women and girls with disabilities, including lifelong education, training and media campaigns that promote respect, dignity, accountability, equality, non-discrimination, inclusion and accessibility, as well as full and effective participation in political and public life and economic empowerment, social protection measures aimed at reducing poverty and financial dependence on other persons and measures aimed at deinstitutionalization and promotion of independent living; 7.

Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of

the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the outcomes of their review conferences, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Recalling all relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the General Assembly and the Security Council and the relevant resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women, which, inter alia, affirmed that all forms of violence against women and girls must be prevented, condemned and eliminated and that women’s and girls’ access to justice and accountability for violations of their human rights must be ensured, GE.21-09200(E) A/HRC/47/L.18 Recalling also the commitment to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 5, in particular targets 5.2 and 5.3, and the commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 16, and taking into account the commitment to leave no one behind, Acknowledging the important role played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls in all their diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Recognizing further the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and A/HRC/47/L.18 ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as facing barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, Stressing that States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access A/HRC/47/L.18 to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent-friendly health services, maternal health care and services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and services can violate, abuse or impair the right to attain the highest standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Recognizing that information and communications technologies, including assistive technology and devices, have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can create conditions enabling the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and can contribute to their social and digital inclusion and digital literacy, empowerment and autonomy, and allow them to live independently on an equal basis with others and to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in society and in the world of work, while condemning all forms of violence against women and girls with disabilities in digital contexts, including new forms of violence such as cyberviolence, bullying and harassment, and their rising prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic, Recognizing also the major contribution made by civil society, including women’s and girls’ rights and community-based organizations, organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, older women, girls and youth, feminist groups, women and girl human rights defenders and disability inclusion advocates, and recognizing further the importance of having open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment and domestic violence, by, inter alia, providing for a supportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, including by raising awareness about the human rights of women and girls in all their A/HRC/47/L.18 diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing further that domestic violence is not a private family matter and must be eliminated, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, 1. Expresses outrage at the persistence and pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide; 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms all forms of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in the context of lockdown measures and school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 3. Expresses deep concern that all forms of discrimination and violence impair or nullify the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which hinders the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others in the economic, social, cultural, civil and political spheres, and is an impediment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 4. Stresses the need to strengthen efforts to empower women and girls with disabilities and enhance their participation and promote their leadership in society by taking measures to address all barriers that prevent or restrict their full and equal participation and inclusion in all spheres of life, including through the creation of enabling programmes, community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes, ensure their access, on an equal basis with others, to economic and financial resources and disability-inclusive and accessible social infrastructure, transportation, justice mechanisms and services, in particular in relation to health and education, as well as productive employment and decent work for women with disabilities, and ensure that the priorities and rights of women and girls with disabilities are fully incorporated into policies and programmes and that they are closely consulted and actively involved in decision-making processes; 5. Also stresses the need to address multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, which place women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, violence and abuse, and to implement measures to prevent and eliminate stereotypes based on disability, gender, age, race and xenophobia, ableism, stigma, negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that cause or perpetuate discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Recognizes that a proactive multisectoral approach, working with all relevant stakeholders, including organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, is required to prevent, respond to and eliminate violence against women and girls with disabilities, including lifelong education, training and media campaigns that promote respect, dignity, accountability, equality, non-discrimination, inclusion and accessibility, as well as full and effective participation in political and public life and economic empowerment, social protection measures aimed at reducing poverty and financial dependence on other persons and measures aimed at deinstitutionalization and promotion of independent living; 7. Calls upon States to take immediate and effective action to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by: (a) Fostering respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, promoting empowering portrayals of women and girls with disabilities and awareness-raising campaigns of their capabilities and contributions, and refraining from supporting or funding campaigns that perpetuate stigmatization or stereotyping of women and girls with disabilities; (b) Reviewing laws and policies that perpetuate the outdated understanding of disability present in charity and medical models and ableism, and incorporating a human rights-based approach to disability; (c) Developing, reviewing and strengthening inclusive policies, including by allocating adequate resources to address the historical, structural and underlying causes and risk factors of violence against women and girls, and ensuring that laws and policies are A/HRC/47/L.18 harmonized to address all forms of violence against women and girls, are inclusive of and accessible to women and girls with disabilities and are implemented in compliance with States’ international human rights obligations; (d) Implementing and allocating adequate resources towards effective and evidence-based programmes and strategies with and for women and girls with disabilities, such as increasing access to assistive devices and technologies and community-based habilitation and rehabilitation services adapted to their requirements, in compliance with States’ international human rights obligations; (e) Ensuring the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls in all their diversity, including women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the development and implementation of accessible and inclusive national policies, legislation, procedures, action plans, programmes, projects and strategies to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls, and ensuring that such participation is conducted in a safe and accessible environment, including through support and capacity-building from organizations of and led by women, girls and other persons with disabilities, and through community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes for women and girls with disabilities;

Fund and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, within their Please recycle @ GE.21-09295(E) A/HRC/47/L.23 respective mandates, to prevent maternal mortality and to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, Recognizing that maternal morbidity, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has a negative impact on the woman’s or girl’s well-being, Recognizing also that preventable maternal morbidity is a human rights concern and that preventable deaths and grievous injuries sustained by women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth are not inevitable events, but rather a direct result of discriminatory laws and practices, harmful gender norms and practices, a lack of functioning health systems and services and a lack of accountability, Stressing the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of, inadequate or inaccessible health-care services, early childbearing, child, early and forced marriage, violence against women and girls, sociocultural barriers, marginalization, illiteracy and gender inequality as root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, equality, accountability, engagement, participation, accessibility, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, non-discrimination and international cooperation, Recognizing also that the underlying determinants of health, such as equitable access to affordable and safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, as well as quality and essential health-care services, are essential to ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing further that violations of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Recognizing also that the right to seek, receive and impart information concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights issues is essential for the accessibility of services, and that unequal access to information by women and girls, including indigenous women and girls, those from ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and those from other marginalized groups, amounts to discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and A/HRC/47/L.23 morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls, including adolescents, throughout the world, Deeply concerned also that women and girls living in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian and conflict settings, are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of human rights violations and abuses, including through sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and lack of affordable, accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment and all types of malnutrition, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overloaded health systems, the reallocation of human and financial resources, including the redeployment of midwives, shortages of medical personnel and supplies, and disruptions to global supply chains, which could undermine the sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights of women and girls, and has affected the availability of and access to health-care workers, access to maternal and newborn care and other essential maternal and child health support and services; safe abortion, when not against national law, and post- abortion care; sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights information and education; contraception; and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, while fear of contracting the virus may inhibit women and girls from visiting health-care facilities, thereby increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned that widespread discrimination against women and girls, including on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, racial or ethnic background, language, religion, health, indigenous or other status, and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination substantially heighten their risk of suffering maternal morbidities, and that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic discrimination faced by women and girls and increased the occurrence of sexual and gender- based violence and harassment, child, early and forced marriage and unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents, thereby also increasing the risk of maternal morbidity, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that the stigma, shame and isolation associated with specific forms of maternal morbidities can lead to harassment, discrimination, ostracism and violence against women and girls and can prevent them from seeking care, thereby resulting in physical, psychological, economic and social harm to or suffering for women and girls, Recognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates not only between but also within countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas and among women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and severe morbidity among adolescent girls in developing countries, and recognizing the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, A/HRC/47/L.23 Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, to the full enjoyment of their human rights, to their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, Deeply concerned that maternal morbidity reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates the full enjoyment of their rights, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, best practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy, and to guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence- based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion, when not against national law, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2.

Also calls upon States to address the underlying determinants of health, such as gender discrimination and socioeconomic factors, including poverty and malnutrition, which render certain women and girls, including adolescents, more vulnerable to maternal morbidities, such as obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others; 5. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a human rights-based approach, to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of available, accessible, acceptable and quality health- care services for all, and of information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, poverty, stigma and lack of confidentiality of medical patient records, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, shortages in human and material resources facing health-care systems, shortages in humanitarian assistance and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and discrimination, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Calls upon States to promote human rights-based and gender responsive multisectoral and cross-disciplinary coordination of policies, programmes, budgets and services designed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities with the active participation of all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, and especially the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls at the national, local and community levels, and to promote social accountability mechanisms to monitor these policies, programmes, budgets and A/HRC/47/L.23 services in order to accelerate the elimination of maternal mortality and morbidity and the achievement of universal access to sexual and reproductive health; 7. Urges States to strengthen the capacity and resourcing of health-care systems and the health workforce, to provide the essential services needed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, such as through increased budget allocations for health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and the deployment and training of midwives, nurses, obstetricians, gynaecologists, doctors, surgeons and anaesthesiologists, in accordance with international medical standards and to ensure holistic social integration services, including counselling, education, family planning, socioeconomic empowerment, social protection and psychosocial services, so that women and girls living with maternal morbidity can overcome stigma, discrimination, ostracism and economic and social exclusion; 8. Also urges States to strengthen their research, data collection and monitoring and evaluation systems to promote reliable, transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls, in order to support more comprehensive policies to prevent and address maternal morbidities; 9. Calls upon States to increase awareness and the visibility of maternal morbidity as a human rights concern, including through more targeted research in this area, allocation of sufficient resources and dedicated efforts to ensure the availability, particularly for women and girls, of information on the causes of specific maternal morbidities and their prevention; 10.

reinforcing, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant international instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International

2030, OER10) Please recycle@ E ) GE.21-09443(E) A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 Welcoming the efforts of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, within their respective mandates, to prevent maternal mortality and to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and their review conferences and outcome documents, in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, Recognizing that maternal morbidity, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has a negative impact on the woman’s or girl’s well-being, Recognizing also that preventable maternal morbidity is a human rights concern and that preventable deaths and grievous injuries sustained by women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth are not inevitable events, but rather a direct result of discriminatory laws and practices, harmful gender norms and practices, a lack of functioning health systems and services and a lack of accountability, Stressing the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of, inadequate or inaccessible health-care services, early childbearing, child, early and forced marriage, violence against women and girls, sociocultural barriers, marginalization, illiteracy and gender inequality as root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, equality, accountability, engagement, participation, accessibility, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, non-discrimination and international cooperation, Recognizing also that the underlying determinants of health, such as equitable access to affordable and safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, as well as quality and essential health-care services, are essential to ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing further that violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and those involving inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post- partum depression and infertility, among others, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Recognizing also that the right to seek, receive and impart information concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights issues is essential for the accessibility of services, and that unequal access to information by women and girls, including indigenous A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 women and girls, those from ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and those from other marginalized groups, amounts to discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls, including adolescents, throughout the world, Deeply concerned also that women and girls living in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian and conflict settings, are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of human rights violations and abuses, including through sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and lack of affordable, accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment and all types of malnutrition, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overloaded health systems, the reallocation of human and financial resources, including the redeployment of midwives, shortages of medical personnel and supplies, and disruptions to global supply chains, which could undermine the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls, and has affected the availability of and access to health-care workers, access to maternal and newborn care and other essential maternal and child health support and services; safe abortion when not against national law, and post- abortion care; sexual and reproductive health information and education; contraception; and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, while fear of contracting the virus may inhibit women and girls from visiting health-care facilities, thereby increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned that widespread discrimination against women and girls, including on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, racial or ethnic background, language, religion, health, indigenous or other status, and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination substantially heighten their risk of suffering maternal morbidities, and that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic discrimination faced by women and girls and increased the occurrence of sexual and gender- based violence and harassment, child, early and forced marriage and unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents, thereby also increasing the risk of maternal morbidity, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that the stigma, shame and isolation associated with specific forms of maternal morbidities can lead to harassment, discrimination, ostracism and violence against women and girls and can prevent them from seeking care, thereby resulting in physical, psychological, economic and social harm to or suffering for women and girls, Recognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates not only between but also within countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas and among women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and severe morbidity among adolescent girls in A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 developing countries, and recognizing the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, to the full enjoyment of their human rights, to their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, Deeply concerned that maternal morbidity reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates the full enjoyment of their rights, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and their review conferences and outcome documents, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, best practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy, and to guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health- care services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion when not against national law, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2. Urges States to ensure the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care services, including mental health and psychosocial services and sexual and reproductive health-care services, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; 3. Calls upon States, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure continuity of sexual and reproductive health-care services, including access to maternal and newborn care, and other essential maternal and child health support and services, safe abortion when not against national law, modern forms of contraception, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, prevention of vertical transmission of HIV, nutrition and mental health services; 4. Also calls upon States to address the underlying determinants of health, such as gender discrimination and socioeconomic factors, including poverty and malnutrition, which render certain women and girls, including adolescents, more vulnerable to maternal morbidities, such as obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others; 5. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a human rights-based approach, to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of available, accessible, acceptable and quality health- care services for all, and of information and education, including evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, poverty, stigma and lack of confidentiality of medical patient records, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, shortages in human and material resources facing health-care systems, shortages in humanitarian assistance and funding shortages affecting A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and discrimination, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Calls upon States to promote human rights-based and gender responsive multisectoral and cross-disciplinary coordination of policies, programmes, budgets and services designed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities with the active participation of all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, and especially the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls at the national, local and community levels, and to promote social accountability mechanisms to monitor these policies, programmes, budgets and services in order to accelerate the elimination of maternal mortality and morbidity and the achievement of universal access to sexual and reproductive health; 7. Urges States to strengthen the capacity and resourcing of health-care systems and the health workforce, to provide the essential services needed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, including through increased budget allocations for health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and the deployment and training of midwives, nurses, obstetricians, gynaecologists, doctors, surgeons and anaesthesiologists, in accordance with international medical standards and to ensure holistic social integration services, including counselling, education, family planning, socioeconomic empowerment, social protection and psychosocial services, so that women and girls living with maternal morbidity can overcome stigma, discrimination, ostracism and economic and social exclusion; 8. Also urges States to strengthen their research, data collection and monitoring and evaluation systems to promote reliable, transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls, in order to support more comprehensive policies to prevent and address maternal morbidities; 9. Calls upon States to increase awareness and the visibility of maternal morbidity as a human rights concern, including through more targeted research in this area, allocation of sufficient resources and dedicated efforts to ensure the availability, particularly for women and girls, of information on the causes of specific maternal morbidities and their prevention; 10. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,! which focuses on maternal morbidity as a human rights issue, and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 11.

The International Solar Alliance, an initiative of India and France, was founded in 2015 at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris. In the Paris declaration regarding the launch of the Alliance, the shared vision of bringing clean, affordable and renewable energy within the reach of all was expounded. It set for the members the mission to mobilize more than $1 trillion in investments for the mass deployment of affordable solar energy by 2030. The then Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, attended the ceremony in Paris, on 30 November 2015, at which the Alliance was launched. Establishment of the International Solar Alliance 2. The international steering committee of the International Solar Alliance, established at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, deliberated on and finalized the framework agreement on the establishment of the Alliance and the institutional framework of the Alliance and its secretariat. The agreement was opened for signature at the twenty-second Conference of the Parties, in 2016, and entered into force on 6 December 2017 in accordance with article XIII of the agreement, with the Alliance acquiring the status of a treaty-based international organization. Subsequently, the framework agreement was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. The founding conference of the International Solar Alliance, held on 11 March 2018, saw the adoption of the “Delhi Solar Agenda”, in which the parties to the framework agreement reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 4. The framework agreement provides that the seat of the International Solar Alliance shall be in India. The Alliance signed a headquarters agreement with the Government of India on 26 March 2018 in which the international legal personality of the Alliance was recognized, consistent with article X of the framework agreement. Article X also provides that, in the territory of each member State and subject to its national laws and the conclusion of a separate agreement, if necessary, the Alliance may enjoy the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent discharge of its functions and programmes. Subsequently, after transferring all assets and liabilities to the first Assembly of the Alliance in October 2018, the international steering committee of the Alliance ceased to exist pursuant to article XIII of the framework agreement. Institutional and organizational structure Assembly 5. The Assembly of the International Solar Alliance, which was established under article IV of the framework agreement and includes representatives from each member State, is the chief decision-making body of the Alliance. The Assembly takes all necessary decisions on the implementation of the agreement and on coordinated action to be taken to achieve its objectives. It is chaired by the President and co-chaired by the Co-President, both elected by the Assembly for a term of two years. The President and the Co-President are supported by eight Vice-Presidents, two each from the four geographical regions of the Alliance — Africa, Asia and the Pacific, 5/20 A/76/192 Europe and others, and Latin America and the Caribbean — selected on the basis of seniority in terms of the submission of the instrument of ratifications to the depositary of the Alliance, that is, the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India. 6. The first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held on 3 October 2018. The Assembly adopted a number of significant decisions, including on the programme of work and budget, the approval of the provisional rules of procedure of the Assembly, the appointment of the Director General, a model agreement on privileges and immunities between the Alliance and individual member States, and the approval of the manual of regulations for the Alliance. Subsequent meetings of the Assembly were held in 2019 and 2020, with a special assembly convened in February 2021 to appoint the successor to the then Director General of the Alliance. Currently, India and France are the Co-Presidents of the Assembly. Standing committee 7. The standing committee, established by the Assembly, comprises the President, the Co-President, eight Vice-Presidents, and up to nine additional members who may be appointed in accordance with rule 79 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The standing committee is responsible and accountable to the Assembly and carries out the powers and functions entrusted to it under the rules of procedure, as well as those functions delegated to it by the Assembly. The committee is mandated, inter alia, to consider the programme of work and budget of the International Solar Alliance, to substantiate the approved programme of work, to take stock of Alliance programmes, to consider and recommend to the Assembly proposals with substantial financial implications for the Alliance, and to advise the secretariat on any emergent issues, upon request. Regional committees 8. To enhance regional cooperation and collaboration, a regional committee is established by the Assembly, under its rules of procedure, for each of the four regions of the International Solar Alliance. Each regional committee comprises the two Vice- Presidents selected from the region and all other Alliance members from the region. The regional committees are responsible and accountable to the Assembly. The regional committees serve as the forum for the regional coordination of views on matters related to the Assembly. The regional committees are mandated, inter alia, to support the harmonization and aggregation of demand, to review the scope of solar applications for members and to assess the aggregate effect of the Alliance programmes in the region. Secretariat 9. The secretariat is established pursuant to article V of the framework agreement. The members, Assembly and committees of the International Solar Alliance are supported by the secretariat to assist them in their collective work under the agreement and the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The secretariat comprises the Director General, who is the Chief Executive Officer, and other staff, as required. The standing committee of the Alliance has approved the provision of 12 international posts and 20 national posts at the Alliance secretariat, for which recruitment is in process. 10. The secretariat coordinates all programmes, activities and initiatives entrusted to it by the Assembly through the national focal points, appointed by each member State in accordance with article II of the framework agreement. 11. Article VIII of the framework agreement provides that partner organization status may be granted to organizations that have the potential to help the International 6/20 A/76/192 Solar Alliance to achieve its objectives. It is specifically stated therein that the United Nations, including its organs, will be the strategic partner of the Alliance. At its first meeting on 3 October 2018, the Assembly requested the secretariat to establish institutional links between the Alliance and the United Nations and authorized the secretariat to apply for observer status for the Alliance in the General Assembly of the United Nations. Membership 12. The International Solar Alliance was established as an alliance of solar-resource rich countries, with its membership open to the 121 States Members of the United Nations that lie fully or partially between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. However, on 3 October 2018, the first Assembly of the Alliance adopted a resolution proposed by India to amend the framework agreement of the Alliance to expand the scope of its membership to all Member States. The amendment entered into force on 8 January 2021 and was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. As of July 2021, 79 States members of the Alliance and 19 other States are expected to ratify the agreement. 13. The current membership of the International Solar Alliance covers a significant proportion of the global population. Moreover, a large proportion of the membership is comprised of the least developed countries and small island developing States that stand to benefit significantly from the programmes and activities of the Alliance. As of July 2021, the following States from the four regions of the Alliance are members: Africa 1. Algeria 2. Benin 18. Guinea 19. Madagascar 20. Malawi 3. Botswana 21. Mali 4. Burkina Faso 22.

Under the Paris declaration of the International Solar Alliance, the Alliance is mandated to promote collaboration and cooperation among its member States in order to lower the cost of solar energy and facilitate the massive and needs-based deployment of solar energy through innovative policies, projects, programmes, capacity-building measures and financial instruments. As an action-oriented organization, the Alliance was established to support and enhance the efforts of the global community aimed at meeting the collective ambition of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on Goals 7 and 13. 15. The International Solar Alliance lends its support to its member States across the three critical areas of energy access, energy security and energy transition. The strategic interventions of the Alliance are aimed at reducing the cost of technology and finance and at facilitating the mobilization of low-cost investment in the solar energy sector. 16. The International Solar Alliance plays the crucial roles of accelerator, enabler, incubator and facilitator of the deployment of clean and affordable solar energy at scale to address those key critical issues. As an accelerator, the Alliance supports the creation of economies of scale in the solar energy sector across its membership and the reduction of transaction costs to lower the cost of deploying solar energy in member States. As an enabler, it supports capacity-building interventions to create a well-qualified pool of human resources talent to drive solar energy programmes in member States. 17. In addition, the International Solar Alliance supports the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory ecosystem across its membership through knowledge creation and exchange. As an incubator, the Alliance supports, through its network of partnerships, the development and adoption of innovative financing and risk mitigation modalities across its membership to attract low-cost private and institutional finance. As a facilitator, it supports member States with developing viable solar energy road maps and integrating these with their overarching energy and climate objectives. Further, the Alliance facilitates the mobilization of finance for solar energy projects. 18. To achieve the vision and mission of the International Solar Alliance, the following guiding principles for members of the Alliance are set down in article II of its framework agreement: (a) Members take coordinated actions through programmes and activities launched on a voluntary basis, aimed at better harmonizing and aggregating demand 9/20 A/76/192 for, inter alia, solar finance, solar technologies, innovation, research and development, and capacity-building; (b) In this endeavour, members cooperate closely and strive to establish mutually beneficial relationships with relevant organizations, public and private stakeholders, and non-member States; (c) For those solar applications for which it seeks the benefits of collective action under the Alliance and on the basis of a common analytical mapping of solar applications, each member shares and updates relevant information regarding its needs and objectives, domestic measures and initiatives taken or intended to be taken in order to achieve these objectives, and obstacles along the value chain and dissemination process. The secretariat maintains a database of these assessments in order to highlight the potential for cooperation. VI. Funding 19. The International Solar Alliance was conceived as a voluntary alliance of sovereign countries with no membership fee. Article VI of its framework agreement outlines the sources of funding, which include voluntary contributions from member States, partner organizations including regional economic integration organizations and the United Nations and its agencies, and the private sector as potential sources of funding for the Alliance. The revenue generated from specific activities, approved by the Assembly, are additional sources of finance for the Alliance. 20. India, the host country of the International Solar Alliance, made an initial contribution of $16 million to the Alliance corpus fund, in addition to its contribution to the recurring expenditure of the Alliance for five years from 2016 to 2021. 21. Myanmar and the Comoros have made voluntary contributions to the corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance. France, the co-founder of the Alliance, has provided initial support through the provision of two experts to the Alliance secretariat, as well as initial support of €50,000 for the programme to enable solar technical centres in member States. In addition, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Australia have made financial and/or in- kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 22. The partner organizations of the International Solar Alliance, such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Union, the French Development Agency, the Climate Investment Funds and the World Resources Institute, have also made financial and in-kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 23. Asof March 2021, the total corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance stood at $33.5 million, with contributions amounting to $17.5 million from the corporate sector. VII. Programme and projects 24. The International Solar Alliance has launched seven thematic programmes since its inception that are dedicated to the deployment of cross-cutting solar energy applications across multiple sectors, including agriculture, health and electricity. The programmes of the Alliance are intended to provide a holistic solution to the triple challenge of energy access, energy security and energy transition through a blend of small-scale off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications and large 10/20 A/76/192 utility-scale projects. The following are the seven thematic programmes of the Alliance: (a) Scaling solar applications for agricultural use. This programme is focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications, including solar water pumping systems, solar energy-based drinking water applications and water, sanitation and hygiene interventions; solar home lighting and other off-grid lighting solutions; and solar energy-based cold storage; (b) Affordable finance at scale. This is an overarching programme dedicated to identifying and promoting innovative financing modalities and risk mitigation instruments to lower the cost of finance in the solar energy sector; (c) Scaling solar mini-grids. This programme is dedicated to promoting the electrification of regions that have yet to establish grid connectivity; (d) Scaling solar rooftop. This programme is dedicated to the promotion of solar rooftop applications for industrial, commercial and government consumers; (e) Scaling solar e-mobility and storage. This programme is dedicated to promoting e-mobility solutions based on solar energy, solar-powered charging infrastructure and energy storage solutions at scale; (f) Solar park. This programme complements other programmes that are focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications to meet the challenge of energy access. It focuses on deploying large utility-scale ground- mounted solar projects to support member States in integrating solar energy into their energy mix at the speed and scale necessary to meet the challenges of energy security and energy transition; (g) Solar heating and cooling. This programme is dedicated to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the rapidly increasing heating and cooling requirements across the membership of the Alliance. The programme encompasses the industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential sectors. 25. In addition to the thematic programmes, the International Solar Alliance has launched specific sectoral interventions, such as the “ISA CARES” initiative, which is aimed at solarizing the health sector to address the challenge of energy access, with a particular focus on developing and least developed countries. The aim of the initiative is to provide not only solar energy-based electricity but additional infrastructure such as solar-powered vaccine cold chains and mobile health clinics. VIII. Capacity-building programmes 26. The International Solar Alliance has been equally receptive to the capacity- building needs of its member States to develop and manage solar assets, including those to be deployed under its thematic programmes and other initiatives. The Alliance is working to support its members in developing capacity to deploy scaled- up solar applications through the development of a network of technical training, entrepreneurship, research and innovation centres in order to harmonize and deliver training programmes using a network of training facilities that would be recognized across the member States. 27. The Solar Technology Applications and Resources Centre network will facilitate the exchange of best practices and promote knowledge dissemination and capacity - building with regard to solar energy, supporting stakeholders across the full deployment process (including technicians, master trainers, project developers, engineers and policymakers). In addition, the network is aimed at supporting the 11/20 A/76/192 standardization of solar technology applications and supporting collaborative research and development, including with the private sector. IX. Projects in individual countries 28. The International Solar Alliance has launched an initiative, approved at its third Assembly, to facilitate, through technical and financial support, solar energy demonstration projects across 47 least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States of the Alliance — 26 countries from the African region, 12 from the Asia and the Pacific region and 9 from the Latin American and the Caribbean region. 29. The initiative is aimed at deploying projects for developing resilience in the agriculture and health sectors. The selection of projects would be member-driven. As of February 2021, project proposals have been received from 16 member States among the least developed countries and small island developing States, while discussions with the remaining least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States are under way. 30. The goal of the International Solar Alliance is to facilitate affordable access for member States to funding for solar projects. To this end, through a partnership between the Alliance, the World Bank and the French Development Agency, the solar risk mitigation initiative was launched at the twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Although the cost of solar energy is constantly falling, its deployment remains slow in certain emerging markets, notably in Africa, where a belief is held in the private sector that the funding of solar projects entails too many risks. The solar risk mitigation initiative is aimed at reversing this trend. It involves the creation of the following: (a) A technical assistance programme for developing sustainable solar projects (support for planning, resource mapping and electrical sector reform) and the solar deployment guidelines, which help countries to identify clear and stable solar goals; (b) A new procurement platform, which will be launched online and will be used to facilitate and collect solar project bids; (c) Hedging instruments to protect against the financial risks inherent in renewable energy production projects, in order to guarantee the solvency of the suppliers. 31. The International Solar Alliance, in partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, is also facilitating a pilot project for solar-powered food and vaccine cold chain technologies in Nigeria. The project is aimed at demonstrating innovative and low-cost technologies that are run on self-sustaining financial models. 32. The International Solar Alliance has signed an agreement with the African Development Bank to harness solar energy. The basic objective of the joint declaration, as mentioned in the agreement, was to develop a road map to mobilize financing for the promotion of solar energy in prospective African International Solar Alliance member States. 12/20 A/76/192 X. Observer status for the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly 33. The primary objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Accelerating the transition towards a low-carbon economy and boosting investments in infrastructure for renewable energy, notably solar power, is therefore critical to realizing the goals of the Agreement. 34. Accordingly, solar energy is an important constituent of renewable energy as an alternative source owing to its wider availability as well as its affordability. The International Solar Alliance is being established at a time when there is a growing need for renewable energy as an alternative source of energy at both the global and regional levels. 35. The International Solar Alliance is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations sustainable development process and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. The primary goal of the Alliance is to lower the cost of finance and spur investments across the solar supply chain, including in manufacturing, project development and storage. 36. The aims, objectives and activities of the International Solar Alliance as set out in the framework agreement and its activities as reflected in the programmes are relevant to the work of the General Assembly in the area of renewable energy. The Alliance is striving to promote the massive deployment of solar energy globally and thereby provide energy security and promote sustainable development in its member States. 37. The promotion of solar energy in the context of the health infrastructure in developing countries supports the achievement of Goal 3, aimed at ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. 38. The various activities of the International Solar Alliance advance many of the objectives of the Paris Agreement and thus contribute to addressing the challenges posed by global warming. 39. The International Solar Alliance plays an important role internationally in supporting the implementation of several United Nations conventions on climate change and the global climate change agenda in general. The participation of the Alliance in major international meetings involving these issues is often critical for the Alliance to carry out its work and mandate. In addition, the Alliance has the wide- ranging resources and expertise needed to make a significant contribution to all such meetings, dialogues and decisions by helping to shape the global policy dialogue and supporting its implementation on solar energy. 40. Since the entry into force of the amendment to the framework agreement on 8 January 2021, the membership of the International Solar Alliance has been universalized and is open to all States Members of the United Nations. It is expected to expand quickly, giving a boost to the efforts of the Alliance to promote the use of solar energy globally. 41. The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance explicitly designates the United Nations, including its organs, as a strategic partner of the Alliance. Observer status will greatly enhance the ability of the Alliance to achieve its goals. The Alliance will be able to follow the deliberations in the General Assembly closely, to cooperate with United Nations organs, agencies and programmes in the implementation of its programmes and activities and to benefit 13/20 A/76/192 from the United Nations through its network of field offices, experience in programme cooperation with Governments, and extensive resources in the development process. 42. We believe that the International Solar Alliance can contribute positively to the fields of sustainable development, renewable energy and climate change and can enhance the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. 43. Granting observer status to the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly would enable the Alliance to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes on the basis of grass-root level experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. The Alliance is also taking a big step towards addressing issues such as technology transfer, the storage of solar energy, and even financial assistance to member States, along with project layout and project planning measures. 44. Cooperation between the United Nations and the International Solar Alliance has the potential to support progress towards building national capacities to reduce poverty and exclusion, enhancing sustainable human development and achieving nationally and internationally agreed development goals. The initiatives of the United Nations and the Alliance can serve as a powerful tool for addressing the challenges faced by developing countries and accelerating progress towards the Goals, and specifically Goal 7: to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. 45. The International Solar Alliance, through its efforts to bring about just and equitable energy solutions through the deployment of solar energy, is expected to usher in a new era of green energy diplomacy. The granting of observer status to the Alliance in the General Assembly would help to provide for regular and well-defined cooperation between the Alliance and the United Nations that would benefit global clean energy growth and sustainable development. 14/20 A/76/192 Annex I1 Framework Agreement on the establishment of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) We, the Parties to this Agreement, Recalling the Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance of 30"" November 2015 and the shared ambition to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than US $ 1000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy, and pave the way for future technologies adapted to the needs, Recognizing that solar energy provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to their peoples, Acknowledging the specific and common obstacles that still stand in the way of rapid and massive scale-up of solar energy in these countries, Affirming that these obstacles can be addressed if solar resource rich countries act in a coordinated manner, with strong political impulse and resolve, and that better harmonizing and aggregating the demand for inter alia solar finance, technologies, innovation or capacity building, across countries, will provide a strong lever to lower costs, increase quality, and bring reliable and affordable solar energy within the reach of all, United in their desire to establish an effective mechanism of coordination and decision-making among them, Have agreed as follows: Article I Objective Parties hereby establish an International Solar Alliance (hereinafter referred to as the ISA), through which they will collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in line with their needs.

peacekeeping, such as consent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force, except in self-defence and defence of the mandate, Stressing that the primacy of politics should be the hallmark of the approach of the United Nations to the resolution of conflict, including through mediation, good offices, the monitoring of ceasefires, assistance to the implementation of peace accords,

convinced that this should guide the design and deployment of United Nations peace operations, and understanding United Nations peace operations as peacekeeping operations and special political missions, Recognising the crucial role peacekeeping plays in creating conditions for stability and lasting peace, and the need for United Nations peace operations to have integrated strategies that articulate a clear pathway to transition and to achieving sustainable peace, and wunderlining that transitions of United Nations Peace Operations are understood as a strategic process which builds towards a reconfiguration of the strategy, footprint, and capacity of the United Nations in a way that supports peacebuilding objectives and the development of a sustainable peace, in a manner that supports and reinforces national ownership, informed by the operational context and the national priorities and needs of the host State and its population, and that includes engagement with local community and civil society, and, where relevant, regional and sub-regional organisations, and other relevant stakeholders, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and the inclusion of youth and persons with disabilities, Reiterating the primary responsibility of States to protect the population throughout their territories, recognising that reconfigurations of missions may entail increased risks for civilians, in particular for women, youth, children, persons with disabilities, and, where relevant, the need to enhance States’ capacity to protect their own civilians, emphasising the importance of security sector reform, poverty reduction measures, gender equality, human rights monitoring and reporting, the promotion of rule of law and good governance, and the extension of legitimate State authority in ensuring the protection of civilians over the longer term and in the consolidation of peace and stability, taking note of interlinkages between transitional justice, inclusive disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration processes, functional child protection services, national small arms and light weapons management, and organised crime and anti-corruption measures, for enhancing stability, reaffirming that development, peace and security, and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, and recalling further the General Assembly resolution, A/RES/70/1, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, Recognising that States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure the human rights of all persons within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction as provided for by international law, and acknowledging the important role of those who protect and promote human rights, civil society organisations, journalists and other media workers in the promotion and protection of human rights, Reaffirming its commitment to addressing the impact of armed conflict on women, youth, and children, and recalling its resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security, resolution 1265 (1999) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, resolution 2250 on youth, peace and security, resolution 1261 (1999) on children and armed conflict, and resolution 2475 (2019) on the disproportionate impact of armed conflict and related humanitarian crises on persons with disabilities, as well as all subsequent resolutions concerning these agendas, Reaffirming its commitment to include in the mandates of peace operations a desired outcome of the implementation of sequenced, mandated tasks and, where appropriate, a clear prioritisation of tasks to achieve this outcome, reflecting the need to create favourable conditions for sustainable peace, understanding prioritisation as the mission focussing on those specific mandated tasks which are based on up-to-date conflict analysis and planning and are assessed as responding to the evolving needs on the ground, and further understanding sequencing as a logical, flexible implementation of the mandate over time, in line with the strategic vision as set out 2/6 S/2021/771 in the mandate, aligned with the peace and security needs within the host State, building towards a consolidation of peace, Recognising that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is the responsibility of all stakeholders and is contingent upon several critical factors, including well-defined, realistic and achievable mandates, political will, leadership, performance and accountability at all levels, adequate resources, policy, planning and operational guidelines and training and equipment, and welcoming further engagement and dialogue between United Nations, troop and police contributing countries, and other relevant stakeholders to improve performance and inform decisions regarding mandate design, Reaffirming its belief that United Nations peacekeeping, including mission transition processes, is a unique global partnership that draws together the contributions and commitments of the entire United Nations system, and reaffirms its commitment to strengthening this partnership,

stakeholders in support of more effective United Nations peacekeeping through his initiatives “Action for Peacekeeping” and “Action for Peacekeeping +”, which highlight the importance of advancing political solutions, strengthening protection of civilians, improving the safety and security of peacekeepers, implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda, supporting effective performance and accountability, improving peacekeeping partnerships, strengthening the conduct of peacekeeping operations and personnel, and strengthening the impact of peacekeeping on peacebuilding and sustaining peace, Reaffirming that “sustaining peace” should be broadly understood as a goal and a process to build a common vision of a society, ensuring that the needs and human rights of all segments of the population are taken into account, which encompasses activities, including promotion of justice and accountability, aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, addressing root causes, assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction and development, and emphasising that sustaining peace is a shared task and responsibility that needs to be fulfilled by the government and all other national stakeholders and should flow through all three pillars of the United Nations’ engagement at all stages of conflict, and in all its dimensions, and needs sustained international attention and assistance, 1. Stresses the crucial role peace operations play in the pursuit of sustainable political solutions and building peace, and, in this regard, emphasises the need for peace operations to engage at the earliest possible stage in integrated planning and coordination on transitions with the Resident Coordinators, United Nations Country Team, other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, the host State and other national stakeholders including civil society and further emphasises that in order to be sustainable, the transition planning process should take into account broad challenges, including risks to stability, governance, and the rule of law, as well as the political, economic, development, humanitarian, and human rights context; 2. Requests the Secretary-General to plan for United Nations peace operations transitions which are integrated within the wider country-specific transition to peace and to elaborate mission transition strategies which build towards the reconfiguration of the strategy, footprint and capacity of the United Nations presence, informed by input from stakeholders at all levels, including in close consultation with national authorities, the Resident Coordinator and United Nations Country Team, local communities and organisations, including those that contribute to peacebuilding, with the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women and 3/6 S/2021/771 inclusion of youth, regional and sub-regional organisations, as well as relevant International Financial Institutions and United Nations funds, programmes and agencies, and further requests that these mission strategies clarify roles and responsibilities for all relevant United Nations stakeholders as well as, where relevant, clear and realistic benchmarks and indicators which measure factors and conditions that might impact the reconfiguration in order to ensure a successful and durable transition; 3. Encourages national governments to develop and implement comprehensive national plans, policies, or strategies to protect civilians, which include national benchmarks, in advance of peace operations transitions and requests the Secretary-General to direct United Nations peace operations to engage with host State governments, other United Nations entities, civil society, including women and youth, those who protect and promote human rights, International Financial Institutions, and all relevant stakeholders to assist, when requested by host state governments, in the development, implementation and monitoring of national strategies and plans for transition including on the protection of civilians, human rights and access to justice, in line with the United Nations peace operations transitions strategy; 4.

Expresses the importance of a United Nations presence appropriately configured with necessary capabilities and capacities to provide support to protection of civilians efforts during transitions, further expresses its intention, where relevant, to consider the appropriate measures through which a mandated, reconfigured United Nations presence could provide such support, including through supporting the establishment of and training in the use of early warning and rapid response systems, deployment of mobile monitoring teams, facilitating local crisis mediation, utilising communications and outreach strategies with populations at risk of violence including sexual and gender-based violence, advancing conflict prevention, mitigation, and reconciliation, including through promoting and supporting inter-communal dialogue and community violence reduction, building trust between State authorities and local communities, supporting community policing initiatives, or other methods of unarmed civilian protection, and recalling the primary responsibility of States to protect the population throughout their territories; 6. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that comprehensive gender analysis and technical gender expertise are included throughout all stages of mission planning, mandate implementation and review and throughout the transition process, as well as mainstreaming of a gender perspective, and to ensure the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women, and the inclusion of youth, as well as measures to safeguard the interests of persons with disabilities, and further requests the 4/6 S/2021/771 Secretary-General to ensure that their needs are fully integrated in all prioritised and sequenced stages of a mission mandate and mission transitions; 7. Requests the Secretary-General to further strengthen coordination between United Nations police, justice, and corrections activities, as well as between United Nations uniformed components and as appropriate, the relevant host State authorities, with a view to supporting States’ ability to provide critical functions in these fields, recognises that, in line with host State needs, strengthening the capacity of representative, responsive, accountable host State security sector and rule of law institutions, which are compliant with applicable international law, is critical for the development of a sustainable peace, and further requests the Secretary-General to produce a review across relevant peacekeeping missions of the implementation of mandates to support the restoration and extension of legitimate state authority and security sector reform with a view to identifying lessons learned for transition planning, and in his regular reports on relevant peacekeeping operations to the Security Council to include information on the challenges, best practices, and lessons learned in implementing mandates to support the restoration and extension of legitimate state authority and security sector reform with a view to facilitating transition planning; 8.

Acknowledging the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the high-level panel discussion on the question of the death penalty,? according to which the panel found that there was no evidence that the death penalty had a deterrent effect that reduced the crime rate, Mindful of the work of the special procedure mandate holders who have addressed human rights issues related to the death penalty, including the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Mindful also of the work undertaken by the treaty bodies to address human rights issues related to the death penalty, Recognizing the role of regional and subregional instruments and initiatives towards the abolition of the death penalty, which in some cases have led to the prohibition of the use of the death penalty, Welcoming the fact that the international trend towards the abolition of the death penalty is continuing and that many States are applying a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, and welcoming also all measures taken by States towards limiting the application of the death penalty, Noting that, according to the Human Rights Committee, States parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that have abolished the death penalty are barred from reintroducing it, and noting also that the reinstatement of the death penalty by a State party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is a violation of international law, Noting also that States with different legal systems, traditions, cultures and religious backgrounds have abolished the death penalty or are applying a moratorium on its use, Strongly deploring the fact that the use of the death penalty leads to violations of the human rights of the persons facing the death penalty and of other affected persons, Emphasizing that lack of transparency in the use of the death penalty has direct consequences for the human rights of the persons sentenced to death and for other affected persons, Emphasizing also the importance of transparency to ensure that those in detention awaiting execution are treated humanely, with respect for their inherent dignity, and that their prison conditions comply with international standards, such as the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules), Noting that discrimination against persons belonging to vulnerable or marginalized groups is aggravated when transparency does not exist or is insufficient, Recalling that, particularly in cases of capital punishment, States must guarantee transparency in order to ensure that all persons benefit from due process guarantees, such as ' A/HRC/48/29. 2 A/HRC/48/38. A/HRC/48/L.17 a fair and public trial and adequate assistance by legal counsel at every stage of proceedings, including during detention and arrest, without discrimination of any kind, Recalling also that derogation from transparency guarantees, as part of due process and the rule of law, is never permitted in death penalty cases, even during a state of emergency, and noting further that since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, additional limitations on transparency and due process were recorded in some countries, including for death penalty cases, Recalling further that persons sentenced to death, their families and their lawyers should be provided with timely and reliable information on the procedures and timing of appeals, clemency petitions and executions, Stressing that the term “the most serious crimes” has consistently been read restrictively and interpreted as pertaining only to crimes of extreme gravity involving intentional killing, and stressing also that under no circumstances can the death penalty ever be applied as a sanction against specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery, consensual same-sex conduct or relations, establishing political opposition groups or offending a head of State, and that States parties that retain the death penalty for such offences commit a violation of their international obligations, Stressing also the need to examine further in which circumstances the imposition or application of the death penalty violates the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including because of the death row phenomenon, the methods of execution or the lack of transparency around executions, Emphasizing that access to consular assistance for foreign nationals, provided for in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, is an important aspect of the protection of those facing the death penalty abroad, Acknowledging the interest in studying the question of the death penalty, as well as in holding local, national, regional and international debates related thereto, Emphasizing the importance for the effectiveness and transparency of debates on the death penalty of ensuring that the public has access to balanced information, including accurate information and statistics on criminality and the various effective ways to combat it without resorting to capital punishment, 1.

Calls upon States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure that any trial leading to the imposition of the death penalty complies with international fair trial guarantees, including during a state of emergency, bearing in mind that failure to be transparent in proceedings resulting in the imposition of the death penalty could constitute a violation of the right to life; 5. Calls upon States to ensure that all accused persons, in particular poor and economically vulnerable persons, can exercise their rights relating to equal access to justice, to ensure adequate, qualified and effective legal representation at every stage of civil and criminal proceedings in cases of capital punishment through effective legal aid, and to ensure that those facing the death penalty can exercise their right to seek pardon or commutation of their death sentence; 6. Also calls upon States to ensure that children whose parents or parental caregivers are on death row, the inmates themselves, their families and their legal representatives are provided, in advance, with adequate information about a pending A/HRC/48/L.17 execution, including its date, time and location, and to allow a last visit or communication with the convicted individual and the return of the body to the family for burial, or to provide information about where the body is located, unless this is not in the best interests of the child; 7. Further calls upon States to comply with their obligations under article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and to inform without delay foreign nationals who have been arrested or detained of their right to contact the relevant consular post and to communicate with their consular representatives, bearing in mind that failure to promptly inform detained foreign nationals of their right to consular notification pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, resulting in the imposition of the death penalty, would likely violate the right to life; 8.

Calls upon States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to be transparent with respect to their execution methods, including through legislation, protocols or practices, bearing in mind that the judiciary has a key role to play in ensuring transparency in methods of execution; 10.

Requests the Secretary-General to dedicate the 2023 supplement to his quinquennial report on capital punishment to the relationship between articles 6 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights focusing on the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence and the right to have to one’s conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law, in accordance with the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty as set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50, and to present it to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-fourth session; 12.

Further calls upon States to comply with their obligations under article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, and to inform without delay foreign nationals who have been arrested or detained of their right to contact the relevant consular post and to communicate with their consular representatives, bearing in mind that failure to promptly inform detained foreign nationals of their right to consular notification pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, resulting in the imposition of the death penalty, would likely violate the right to life; 8.

school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services hinder the fulfilment of the human rights of all women and girls and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations and for women and girls in vulnerable situations, Strongly condemning attacks on and abductions of all girls, deploring all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions, their students and staff, and urging States to protect them from attacks, Deeply concerned that funding for the promotion of the human rights of women and girls, including for the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, is often among the first things to be reduced during situations of crisis, that child, early and forced marriage and sexual and reproductive health needs remain largely unaddressed in crisis settings, and that the COVID-19 containment measures are often delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes, including education programmes on child, early and forced marriage, and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for those affected, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, that it is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence against women and girls and other harmful practices and human rights violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of structural and institutional discrimination against women and girls, deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal traditions, discriminatory norms, gender stereotypes, perceptions and customs and disregard for women’s dignity, bodily integrity and autonomy, that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned also that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and other forms of sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to freely choose a spouse, to enter into marriage only with free and full consent and to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and recognizing that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect and consent and the freedom to choose whether to marry and whether to have sexual relations, Deeply concerned that poverty, insecurity, lack of sustainable development, lack of access to education and health services and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities and that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies and other crises are among the exacerbating factors, and stressing the need to promote sustainable development and eradicate poverty, A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 Deeply concerned also that child, early and forced marriage disproportionately affects girls and young women who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma relating to menstruation and social and gender norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities, as well as access to education and explaining consent and respecting boundaries, are some of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities and the active participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision- making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development and their full, effective and meaningful participation in economic, social, political and public life, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing also that the economic autonomy of women and investment in women’s and girls” development are priorities in and of themselves, have a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including but not limited to sexual and reproductive health, and the critical importance of ensuring that health-care services have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing all forms of discrimination, and recognizing the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions and access to comprehensive health-related education and information, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported, and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, in particular at the community level, and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and possible retribution, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of providing legal aid services with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and addressing gender inequality, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, men and boys, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate sexual and gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and to confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision- making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, organizations led or initiated by young people and feminist groups, Recognizing also that the criminalization alone of child, early and forced marriage is insufficient when introduced without complementary, comprehensive and multisectoral measures and support programmes, including across the health, gender equality and A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 education sectors and with the engagement of the whole community, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of, and the loss of livelihoods for, the families affected and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of child, early and forced informal unions or unregistered marriages, 1. Urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, which include the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution, to guarantee equal access for every girl and woman to quality education, as well as education explaining consent, respect for boundaries and what constitutes unacceptable behaviour and how to report it, that builds self-esteem and informed decision-making and communication skills and promotes the development of respectful relationships based on gender equality, inclusion and human rights, skills development programmes, vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities, counselling, social services to protect them from all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and domestic and intimate-partner violence, formal employment to increase their economic independence, and psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services and medical care, to decrease their social isolation and to increase their economic and political participation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 2.

Urges States, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, communities, not-for-profit organizations and civil society organizations, including in times of crisis, to tackle poverty, the lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives and inequalities that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage and as obstacles to leaving a forced or abusive relationship, and to promote sustainable development, including by: (a) Ensuring the rights of all women and girls to inheritance and property, their access equal to that of men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, and promoting freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as their full, equal and meaningful political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; (b) Ensuring gender-responsive social protection mechanisms, adopting measures to recognize, reduce and redistribute women’s and girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the feminization of poverty, which is exacerbated in times of crisis, including by the COVID-19 pandemic, and addressing the discrimination and gender inequality, including gender stereotypes and harmful social norms, attitudes and behaviours and unequal power relations in which women and girls are viewed as subordinate to men and boys, that are at the root of these imbalances; (¢) Confronting family poverty and social exclusion by investing in family- oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 6. Also urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, by: (a) Developing and enforcing policies and legal frameworks on and strengthening health systems, including health information systems, that ensure uninterrupted, universally accessible, acceptable, affordable and available quality, gender-responsive, adolescent- friendly health services, sexual and reproductive health-care services, information, education and commodities, HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, treatment and care, mental health services and psychosocial support, equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, including menstrual health and hygiene and nutrition interventions and prevention and treatment of, and care for, obstetric fistula and other obstetric complications, by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care, free from mistreatment and violence, as essential services in times of crisis, and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services; (b) Ensuring continuity and further strengthening protection and support services for women and girls who experience all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and domestic violence, in times of crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, especially girls at risk of child, early and forced marriage and already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice, and designating protection shelters, hotlines and help desks, health and support services and legal protection and support as essential services available to all women and girls, in addition to establishing safeguarding measures and raising awareness and providing training for police, members of the judiciary, first responders, health workers and education and child services staff; 7. Further urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and that respect and protect bodily integrity and autonomy, protecting those at risk, including in times of crisis, and supporting women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses, and to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution; 8. Calls upon States to ensure that all initiatives to , amend and implement criminal laws addressing child, early and forced marriage are part of comprehensive rights- based, gender-responsive and cross-government prevention and response strategies and coupled with protection measures and services for victims, survivors and those who are at risk of being subjected to harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage; 9. Urges States to remove any provisions that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims, in particular by repealing or amending such laws; 10. Encourages States to increase public funding for community-based organizations, including organizations led or initiated by young people, including girls, focusing on the human rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, including in times of crisis, and to mitigate the impact of crisis response measures on the ability of civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders working at the local and national levels to continue their work with girls, families and local communities to prevent and respond to child, early and forced marriage; 11. Also encourages States to consult with civil society organizations, including girl-led and youth-led organizations, as well as community-based organizations, focusing on the rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, in crisis response planning and delivery to ensure that the needs of women and girls affected by child, early and forced marriage are not overlooked and are adequately addressed in crisis response and that crisis response measures do not exacerbate factors that contribute to child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices or to sexual and gender-based violence; 12. Urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and protecting the rights of women and girls subjected to this harmful practice, including by informing women, girls and boys about their rights under relevant laws, including in marriage and at its dissolution, improving legal infrastructure, mainstreaming gender equality and human rights perspectives into justice systems, ensuring equal access to legal aid, including legal advice, assistance and representation, as well as access to judicial and other legal remedies, addressing legal inconsistencies, training law enforcement officers, members of the judiciary and professionals working with women and children and ensuring oversight of the handling of cases of child, early and forced marriage, and working to ensure that these mechanisms and remedies remain accessible in times of crisis or are re-established as quickly as possible when affected by crisis; 13. Also urges States to hold persons in positions of authority, such as teachers, religious leaders, traditional authorities, politicians and law enforcement officials, including at the local government level, accountable for not complying with or upholding laws and regulations relating to violence against women and girls, including child, early and forced marriage, in order to prevent and respond in a gender-sensitive manner, to end impunity and to avoid the abuse of power leading to violence against women and girls and the revictimization of victims and/or survivors of such violence; 14. Calls upon States to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages, as well as working to ensure that the registration of births and marriages remains accessible in times of crisis or is re-established as quickly as possible when affected by crisis; 15. Affirms the need for States and relevant United Nations entities and agencies to improve the collection and use of quantitative, qualitative and comparable data, while observing the principles of confidentiality, informed consent and voluntary self- identification, on violence against women and harmful practices, including in humanitarian settings and in the context of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 disaggregated by sex, age, disability, civil status, race, ethnicity, migratory status, geographical location, socioeconomic status, education level and other key factors, as appropriate, to enhance research on, and the dissemination of, evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, and to strengthen monitoring and the assessment of the impact of existing policies and programmes as a means of ensuring their effectiveness and implementation; 16. Calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of, and active consultation with, children, adolescents and youth, including already married girls, on all issues affecting them, to strengthen their voice, agency and leadership, to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, including in digital spaces, that provide information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, and lifelong learning opportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, that empower them, allow them to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities, and to encourage men and boys to also act for change in their communities through being more involved in information and awareness-raising campaigns, intergenerational dialogues and peer education and training programmes, in partnership with women and girls; 17. Decides, in order to increase understanding about the concept of forced marriage, to request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize a two-full-day workshop focusing on the adverse impact of forced marriage on the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner to submit a report on the workshop in an accessible format to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-second session; 18. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to organize the above- mentioned workshop with the participation and involvement of women and girls at risk of, and those subjected to, forced marriage and to collaborate with all relevant stakeholders, including relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, special procedure mandate holders, international and regional organizations, States, scholars, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations, in order to ensure multi-stakeholder participation at the workshop.",10/07/2021,2021_3943183,Peru,* State not a member of the Human Rights Council. !

and the report of the Secretary-General on the issue of child, early and forced marriage,’ Recognizing that urgent action and long-term responses are required to address crisis situations, which may include, among other things, armed conflict, natural disasters, political instability, post-conflict situations, complex emergencies, socioeconomic strife and pandemics, representing a critical threat to the health, safety, security and/or well-being of a community or other large group of people, usually over a wide area, Noting with concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage are highly exacerbated in times of crisis and in humanitarian settings by various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, the use of rape, child, early and forced marriage and other forms of sexual violence as tactics in conflict prohibited under international law, lack of access to education, the stigma of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services and contraception, and respective social services that prevent and respond to violence, disruptions in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that crises give rise to conditions in which new human rights violations and abuses are often perpetrated and existing human rights violations and abuses often intensify and expand, Noting the gains made in ending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease in the proportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the last decade, from one in four to approximately one in five, while expressing deep concern that progress has been uneven across regions, that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are projected to result in 10 to 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that may have been averted by 2030 and that the current pace of change is therefore not sufficient to fulfil the commitment under target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, and in this regard recognizing the need for closer cooperation between States, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic gender-based discrimination faced by women and girls, especially women and girls with disabilities and others in vulnerable situations, including patriarchy, the persistence of historical and structural gender inequalities, racism, stigma, xenophobia and socioeconomic inequalities, and has increased the occurrence of sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, Noting with deep concern that the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including physical school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, will have wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences, during and after the pandemic, and are likely to increase risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence and unintended and/or early pregnancy, which may be either a cause or a consequence of increased child, early and forced marriage, as well as risks related to trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, unsafe abortion and preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, that economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work borne by women and girls and the associated risk of their not returning to 2 A/HRC/41/19. 3 A/75/262. A/HRC/48/L.7 school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services hinder the fulfilment of the human rights of all women and girls and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations and for women and girls in vulnerable situations, Strongly condemning attacks on and abductions of all girls, deploring all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions, their students and staff, and urging States to protect them from attacks, Deeply concerned that funding for the promotion of the human rights of women and girls, including for the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, is often among the first things to be reduced during situations of crisis, that child, early and forced marriage and sexual and reproductive health needs remain largely unaddressed in crisis settings, and that the COVID-19 containment measures are often delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes, including education programmes on child, early and forced marriage, and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for those affected, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, that it is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence against women and girls and other harmful practices and human rights violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of structural and institutional discrimination against women and girls, deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal traditions, discriminatory norms, gender stereotypes, perceptions and customs and disregard for women’s dignity, bodily integrity and autonomy, that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned also that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and other forms of sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to freely choose a spouse, to enter into marriage only with free and full consent and to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and recognizing that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect and consent and the freedom to choose whether to marry and whether to have sexual relations, Deeply concerned that poverty, insecurity, lack of access to education and health services and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities and that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies and other crises are among the exacerbating factors, and stressing the need to promote sustainable development and eradicate poverty, Deeply concerned also that child, early and forced marriage disproportionately affects girls and young women who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a A/HRC/48/L.7 significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma relating to menstruation and social and gender norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities, as well as access to education and information on sexual and reproductive health, including on explaining consent and respecting boundaries, are some of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities and the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development and their full, equal, effective and meaningful participation in economic, social, political and public life, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing also that the economic autonomy of women and investment in women’s and girls’ development are priorities in and of themselves, have a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and sexual and gender based violence inflicted by a current or former partner or spouse, Recognizing further the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including but not limited to sexual and reproductive health, and the critical importance of ensuring that health-care services have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing all forms of discrimination, and recognizing the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions and access to comprehensive health-related education and information, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported, and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, in particular at the community level, and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and possible retribution, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of providing legal aid services with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and addressing gender inequality, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, men and boys, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate sexual and gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and to confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision- making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, organizations led or initiated by young people and feminist groups, Recognizing also that the criminalization alone of child, early and forced marriage is insufficient when introduced without complementary, comprehensive and multisectoral measures and support programmes, including across the health, gender equality and A/HRC/48/L.7 education sectors and with the engagement of the whole community, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of, and the loss of livelihoods for, the families affected and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of child, early and forced informal unions or unregistered marriages, 1.

enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant international human rights instruments, Recalling all previous General Assembly and the Human Rights Council resolutions on the right to privacy in the digital age, and the recent extension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy,! as well as other relevant resolutions, Welcoming the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the right to privacy in the digital age,? noting with interest its reports thereon, and recalling the expert workshop on the right to privacy in the digital age, held by the Office of the High Commissioner on 27 and 28 May 2020, that noted the steadily growing impact of the use of artificial intelligence technologies on the exercise of the right to privacy, pointed to transparency concerns regarding personal data collection and exchanges underlying parts of artificial intelligence systems and expressed concern about adverse privacy impacts of the application of artificial intelligence, Welcoming also the work of various special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights Council on the right to privacy, and taking note of their contributions to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy, Please recycle @ GE.21-14142(E) A/HRC/48/L.9/Rev.1 Taking note of the Secretary-General’s Road Map for Digital Cooperation, launched in June 2020, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Recognizing that the right to privacy can enable the enjoyment of other rights, the free development of an individual’s personality and identity and an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, and noting that the accelerated synchronization of online and offline spaces can affect individuals, including their right to privacy, Noting that algorithmic or automated decision-making processes online can affect the enjoyment of individuals’ rights offline, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, on the basis of international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies and the impact of surveillance on the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, necessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices and to consider potential discriminatory effects, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology, and at the same time enhances the capacity of Governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception, hacking and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age can affect all individuals, with particular effects on women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons, as well as persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, Noting further that women and girls experience gender-specific violations and abuses of their right to privacy, both online and offline, as well as violations or abuses that have gender-specific impacts, Recognizing that the promotion and protection of, and respect for, the right to privacy are important to the prevention of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, abuse and sexual harassment, in particular against women, children and persons with disabilities, as well as any form of discrimination, which can occur in digital and online spaces and includes cyberbullying and cyberstalking, Acknowledging that human rights must be considered in the conception, design, use, deployment and further development of new and emerging technologies, such as those that involve artificial intelligence, as they can, without appropriate safeguards impact the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, and that the risks to these rights can and should be avoided or minimized, including by taking measures to ensure a safe, transparent, accountable, secure and high-quality data infrastructure, by exercising due diligence to assess, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, and by providing effective remedies, including judicial remedies, and redress mechanisms and establishing human oversight, Recognizing that, despite its positive effects, the use of artificial intelligence that requires the processing of large amounts of data, often relating to personal data, including on an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, can pose serious risks to the right to privacy, in particular when employed for identification, tracking, profiling, facial recognition, behavioural prediction or the scoring of individuals, A/HRC/48/L.9/Rev.1 Emphasizing that privacy concerns should not be dismissed as a barrier to innovation, Noting that the use of data extraction and algorithms to target content towards online users may undermine user agency and access to information online, as well as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Noting also the public concern with regard to the intrusiveness and impact of data- gathering practices, the related impacts and harms stemming from surveillance and the increasing use of algorithms involved in the application of artificial intelligence systems, Noting with concern that certain predictive algorithms are likely to result in discrimination when non-representative data are used, Recognizing that racially and otherwise discriminatory outcomes must be prevented in the conception, design, development, deployment and use of new and emerging digital technologies, Noting with concern reports indicating lower accuracy of facial recognition technologies with certain groups, in particular non-white individuals and women, including when non-representative training data are used, that the use of digital technologies can reproduce, reinforce and even exacerbate racial inequality, and in this context the importance of effective remedies, Acknowledging that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, including their movements, social relationships, political activities, private preferences and identity, Recognizing the need to ensure that international human rights law is respected in the conception, design, development, deployment, evaluation and regulation of data-driven technologies and to ensure they are subject to adequate safeguards and oversight, Expressing concern that individuals often do not and/or cannot provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the collection, processing and storage of their data or to the re-use, sale or multiple re-sale of their personal data, as the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, has increased significantly in the digital age, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non- discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with regard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the steps necessary to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data or unlawful or arbitrary hacking and the unlawful or arbitrary use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, violate or abuse the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy, as a result of their activities, Noting with deep concern also the use of technological tools developed by the private surveillance industry by private or public actors to undertake surveillance, hacking of devices and systems, interception and disruption of communications, and data collection, interfering with the professional and private lives of individuals, including those engaged in the promotion and defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers, in violation or abuse of their human rights, specifically the right to privacy, A/HRC/48/L.9/Rev.1 Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights, as set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, and that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, and welcoming the work of Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the application of these principles on digital technologies, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption, pseudonymization and anonymity, are important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of opinion and expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Noting the importance of protecting and respecting the right of individuals to privacy when designing, developing or deploying technological means in response to disasters, epidemics and pandemics, especially the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, including digital exposure notification and contact tracing, Noting also that new and emerging digital technologies can contribute to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and recalling in this regard the importance of protecting health-related data, while noting with concern that some efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have an adverse impact on the enjoyment of the right to privacy, 1. Reaffirms the right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 2. Recalls that States should ensure that any interference with the right to privacy is consistent with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality; 3. Also recalls the increasing impact of new and emerging technologies, such as those developed in the fields of surveillance, artificial intelligence, automated decision- making and machine-learning and of profiling, tracking and biometrics, including facial and emotional recognition, without proper safeguards, on the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association; 4. Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy; 5.

according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Recognizing that the right to privacy can enable the enjoyment of other rights, the free development of an individual’s personality and identity and an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, and noting that the accelerated synchronization of online and offline spaces can affect individuals, including their right to privacy, Noting that algorithmic or automated decision-making processes online can affect the enjoyment of individuals’ rights offline, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, on the basis of international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies and the impact of surveillance on the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, necessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices and to consider potential discriminatory effects, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology, and at the same time enhances the capacity of Governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception, hacking and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age can affect all individuals, with particular effects on women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons, as well as persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, Noting further that women and girls experience gender-specific violations and abuses of their right to privacy, both online and offline, as well as violations or abuses that have gender-specific impacts, Recognizing that the promotion and protection of, and respect for, the right to privacy are important to the

infrastructure, by exercising due diligence to assess, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts, and by providing effective remedies, including judicial remedies, and redress mechanisms and establishing human oversight, Recognizing that, while the use of artificial intelligence can have positive effects, it requires the processing of data, often relating to personal data, including on an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, political activities, gender, race or ethnicity, religion or belief, private preferences and identity, and including metadata, which can pose serious risks to the right to privacy, including when employed for identification, verification, tracking and mass surveillance, profiling, facial and emotional recognition, the prediction of behaviour and personal characteristics or the scoring of individuals, A/HRC/48/L.9 Emphasizing that privacy concerns should not be dismissed as a barrier to innovation, Noting that the use of data extraction and algorithms to target content towards online users may undermine user agency and access to information online, as well as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Noting also the public concern with regard to the intrusiveness and impact of data- gathering practices, the related impacts and harms stemming from surveillance and the increasing use of algorithms involved in the application of

otherwise discriminatory outcomes must be prevented in the conception, design, development, deployment and use of new and emerging digital technologies, Noting with concern reports indicating lower accuracy of facial recognition technologies with certain groups, in particular non-white individuals and women, including when non-representative training data are used, that the use of digital technologies can reproduce, reinforce and even exacerbate racial inequality, and in this context the importance of effective remedies, Acknowledging that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, including their movements, social relationships, political activities, private preferences and identity, Recognizing the need to ensure that international human rights law is respected in the conception, design, development, deployment, evaluation and regulation of data-driven technologies and to ensure they are subject to adequate safeguards and oversight, Expressing concern that individuals often do not and/or cannot provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the collection, processing and storage of their data or to the re-use, sale or multiple re-sale of their personal data, as the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, has increased significantly in the digital age, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non- discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with regard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the steps necessary to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data or unlawful or arbitrary hacking and the unlawful or arbitrary use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, violate or abuse the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their

surveillance, hacking of devices and systems, interception and disruption of communications, and data collection, interfering with the professional and private lives of individuals, including those engaged in the promotion and defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers, in violation or abuse of their human rights, specifically the right to privacy,

“Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, and that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, and welcoming the work of Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the application of these principles on digital technologies, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure

of the United Nations and by relevant regional organizations, where appropriate, and intergovernmental organizations, and recognizing the valuable role of national human rights institutions and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, Recognizing the importance of international, regional and bilateral multi-stakeholder partnerships and initiatives to advance the effective protection and promotion of the rights of the child and the elimination of all forms of violence against children, including all violent punishment of children, Urging all States to respect, protect and fulfil the right of children, including children with disabilities and children in vulnerable situations, to express themselves freely and their right to be heard, to ensure that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, that their views are given due weight and that they are included in decision-making processes, in accordance with their evolving capacities or age and maturity, in all matters affecting them, including those relating to relevant aspects of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while recognizing also the importance of involving children’s organizations and child-led initiatives, Concerned about the occurrence of bullying and cyberbullying in all parts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may be at heightened risk of compromising their health, emotional well-being and education and for a wide range of physical and/or mental health conditions, as well as potential long-term effects on the individual’s ability to realize his or her own potential, Deeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of discrimination, exclusion and inequality and that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of poverty and inequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is one of the greatest global challenges and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, recognizing the impact of poverty beyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable development, and in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence and to promote the resilience of children, their families and their communities, Recognizing that girls are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, including sexual violence, and forced labour, which, among other things, would hinder the realization of their rights and efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and the empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and 4/17 effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing further that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, Expressing serious concern that children with disabilities, particularly girls, face stigmatization, discrimination or exclusion and are disproportionately subjected to mental and physical violence and sexual abuse in all settings, Reaffirming that the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States parties to pursue the full implementation of the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through ensuring access to health-care services, the provision of adequate nutritious food and clean drinking water, hygiene and sanitation, and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Reaffirming also the need to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, and recognizing that infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, remain a leading cause of death in children under 5, along with pre-term birth and intrapartum-related complications, Recognizing that the risk of maternal mortality is highest for girls under 15 years of age and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among girls under 15 years of age in many countries, Profoundly concerned that children, particularly in early childhood, in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, including persistent drought, natural disasters such as extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity and pollution, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and in this regard calling for the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,* Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling the importance of promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrant children, regardless of their migration status, with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration; reaffirming all latest international policy developments and relevant United Nations agreements in this regard; and strengthening international and regional cooperation, within the framework of the United Nations and relevant regional forums, Recognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the greatest global challenges in the history of the United Nations, and noting with deep concern its disproportionately heavy impact, inter alia, on children, and its impact on health and the loss of life, mental health and well-being, as well as the negative impact on global humanitarian needs and the enjoyment of human rights and across all spheres of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, and education, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, trade, societies and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social inequalities 517 within and among countries, which is reversing hard-won development gains and hampering progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and all its Goals and targets, Deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children, including on their access to essential health-care services, and about the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the largest ever mass disruption to education systems across the world, forcing school closures in more than 190 countries and affecting 90 per cent of the world’s students at its peak, with an estimated 7.6 million girls at risk of not returning to school and an estimated 370 million children missing out on free or subsidized school meals, and noting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in schools, and that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and reduce absenteeism, Recognizing also that there is increased reliance on virtual learning, with more than 90 per cent of Governments enacting policies to provide digital or broadcast learning, and that, while recalling Committee on the Rights of the Child general comment No. 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment,> meaningful access to digital technologies can support children to realize the full range of their rights, as has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges faced by children in accessing the Internet and digital devices can limit their right to education, and increase inequalities among and within countries, with children living in rural areas and from the poorest households being the most affected, Stressing that new information and communications technologies and applications can create new ways to enhance education and foster learning and teaching on the rights of the child and can be useful tools to promote children’s rights and protection, and in that regard stressing the need to enhance efforts to expand connectivity and digital learning and bridge the digital divide, including the gender digital divide, while protecting children from violence in the digital environment, Deeply concerned that increased unsupervised use of the Internet, inter alia, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has exacerbated children’s exposure to the risk of all forms of violence, including in digital contexts, inter alia, sexual harassment, peer-to-peer sexual harassment and cyberbullying, child sexual exploitation and abuse, child grooming, trafficking in persons, hate speech, stigmatization, racism, xenophobia and discrimination, Reiterating the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda and that a strong focus is needed on combating poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all violations and abuses and to promote the rights of children, and the importance of promoting education, including

Calls upon States to ensure the enjoyment by all children of all their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination of any kind; 9.
