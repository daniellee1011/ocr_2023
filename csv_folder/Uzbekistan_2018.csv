Welcomes the following set of international rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States: 1. States should comply with the Charter of the United Nations and universally recognized norms governing international relations that enshrine, inter alia, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the diversity of history, culture and social systems of all countries. 2. Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of information and communications technologies and to prevent practices relating to such technologies that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security. 3. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security. 4. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability, and reaffirm the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations. 5. States should recognize the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States. 6. States should endeavour to ensure at all levels of the supply chain the security of information and communications technology goods and services, in order to prevent other States from exploiting their dominant position in information and communications technologies, including dominance in resources, critical infrastructures, core technologies, information and communications technology goods and services and information and 3/7 communications networks, to undermine the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services, or to threaten their political, economic and social security. 7. States should reaffirm the rights and responsibilities of all States, in accordance with the relevant norms and rules, regarding legal protection of their information space and critical information infrastructure against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage. 8. States should recognize that the rights of an individual in the offline environment must also be protected in the online environment; and fully respect rights and freedoms in the information space, including the right and freedom to seek, receive and impart information, taking into account the fact that article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* attaches to that right special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals; 9. All States must play the same role in, and carry equal responsibility for, international governance of the Internet, its security, continuity and stability of operation, and its development in a way which promotes the establishment of multilateral, transparent and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms which ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure the stable and secure functioning of the Internet. 10. States must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. However, the indication that an information and communications technology activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the information and communications technology infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. States should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated. In case of information and communications technology incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the information and communications technology environment and the nature and extent of the consequences. 11. States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies. States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies and should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts. 12. States should consider how best to cooperate to exchange information, assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of information and communications technologies and curb the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, separatism or extremism or that inflames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious grounds, and implement other cooperative measures to address such threats. States may need to consider whether new measures need to be developed in this respect. 4/7 13. States, in ensuring the secure use of information and communications technologies, should respect Human Rights Council resolutions 20/8 of 5 July 2012° and 26/13 of 26 June 2014° on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, as well as General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and 69/166 of 18 December 2014 on the right to privacy in the digital age, to guarantee full respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. 14. A State should not conduct or knowingly support information and communications technology activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public. 15. States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from information and communications technology threats, taking into account General Assembly resolution 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, and other relevant resolutions. 16. States should respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another State whose critical infrastructure is subject to malicious acts using information and communications technologies. States should also respond to appropriate requests to mitigate malicious information and communications technology activity aimed at the critical infrastructure of another State emanating from their territory, taking into account due regard for sovereignty. 17. States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of information and communications technology products, and the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services should not be undermined or their political, economic and social security threatened. 18. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious information and communications technology tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions. 19. States should encourage responsible reporting of information and communications technology vulnerabilities and share associated information on available remedies for such vulnerabilities to limit and possibly eliminate potential threats to information and communications technologies and infrastructure dependent on such technologies. 20. States should not conduct or knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams (sometimes known as computer emergency response teams or cybersecurity incident response teams) of another State. A State should not use authorized emergency response teams to engage in malicious international activity. 21. States should encourage the private sector and civil society to play an appropriate role to improve security of and in the use of information and communications technologies, including supply chain security for information and communications technology products and services. States should cooperate with the private sector and the organizations of civil society in the sphere of > See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 53 and corrigendum (A/67/53 and A/67/53/Corr.1), chap.

A. 5/7 implementation of rules of responsible behaviour in information space with regard to their potential role. 22. States should develop confidence-building measures aimed at increasing predictability and reducing the likelihood of misunderstanding and the risk of conflict. Such measures will include, inter alia, voluntary exchange of information regarding national strategies and organizational structures for ensuring a State’s information security, the publication of white papers and exchanges of best practice, wherever practical and advisable. 23.

Calls for the universal ratification and effective implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and urges those States parties that have not yet done so to consider making the declaration under its article 14, thus providing the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination with the competence to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals within their jurisdiction claiming to be victims of a violation by a State party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention; NM A/73/312. 3/10 6.

Expresses deep concern about increased frequency of attempts and activities intended to desecrate or demolish monuments erected in remembrance of those who fought against Nazism during the Second World War, as well as to unlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such persons, and in this regard urges States to fully comply with their relevant obligations, inter alia, under article 34 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949; 13. Firmly condemns incidents that glorify and promote Nazism, such as incidents involving pro-Nazi graffiti and paintings, including on monuments dedicated to victims of the Second World War; 14. Underlines that neo-Nazism is more than just the glorification of a past movement, it is a contemporary phenomenon with strong vested interests in racial inequality and an investment in gaining broad support for its false claims of racial superiority; 15. Notes with concern that the largely unregulated, decentralized, cheap and anonymous nature of the Internet has allowed neo-Nazi groups to amplify their hate- filled messages and recruit new members across borders; 16. Also notes with concern the increase in the number of racist incidents worldwide, including the rise of skinhead groups, which have been responsible for many of these incidents, as well as the resurgence of racist and xenophobic violence targeting, inter alia, persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic 2 Tbid., para. 79. 3 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1125, No. 17512. 4/10 minorities, or on any other grounds, including arson attacks on houses and vandalization of schools and places of worship; 17.

Encourages States to take concrete measures, including legislative and educational ones, in order to prevent revisionism in respect of the Second World War and the denial of the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the Second World War; 19. Supports the finding of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance that education that seeks to undercut the racist effects of nationalist populism should include accurate and representative accounts of national history that give voice to racial and ethnic diversity and that expose the untruths of those who attempt to write minorities out of national histories and identities in order to sustain ethno-nationalist myths of racially or ethnically “pure” nations; 20. Condemns without reservation any denial of or attempt to deny the Holocaust, as well as any manifestation of religious intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence against persons or communities on the basis of ethnic origin or religious belief; 21. Welcomes the call of the Special Rapporteur for the active preservation of those Holocaust sites that served as Nazi death camps, concentration and forced labour camps and prisons, as well as his encouragement to States to take measures, including legislative, law enforcement and educational measures, to put an end to all forms of Holocaust denial; '* 22. Emphasizes the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur that revisions of the Holocaust and attempts to falsify history not only contribute to the rehabilitation and dissemination of Nazism and other extreme ideologies but also create fertile ground for nationalist and neo-Nazi demonstrations; 23. Underlines that revisionism and attempts to falsify history may fall under the prohibition of hate speech under article 4 (a) of the Convention, whereby States are required to declare as offences punishable by law; 24. Calls upon States to continue to take adequate steps, including through national legislation, in accordance with international human rights law, aimed at the prevention of hate speech and incitement to violence against persons in vulnerable situations and, where necessary, to consider reviewing national anti-racism legislation in the light of the increasingly open expression of hate speech and incitement to violence against such persons; 25. Expresses deep concern at the increase in the presence of groups and individuals espousing ideologies of hatred on the Internet, which, owing to its anonymity and relatively easy transnational accessibility, has aided in the shift of extremist ideology closer to the mainstream by allowing the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, organize meetings and violent protests, fundraise and engage in other activities that would be more difficult without the use of such technologies; 5/10 26. Also expresses deep concern about attempts at commercial advertising aimed at exploiting the sufferings of the victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War by the Nazi regime; 27. Seriously concerned by the fact that neo-Nazi groups have increasingly targeted susceptible individuals, mainly children and youth, by means of specifically tailored websites with the aim of their indoctrination by appealing to them through music, activities, games, “memes” and cartoon characters, as well as the online dissemination of revisionist historical educational lessons; 28. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World War, in particular those committed by the SS organization and by those who fought against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement, and may negatively influence children and young people, and that failure by States to effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of States Members of the United Nations under its Charter, including those related to the purposes and principles of the Organization; 29. Also stresses that all such practices fuel contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the spread and multiplication of various extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and in this regard calls for increased vigilance; 30. Expresses concern that the human rights and democratic challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups are universal and no country is immune to them; 31. Emphasizes the need to take the measures necessary to put an end to the practices described above, and calls upon States and all other stakeholders to take more effective measures in accordance with international human rights law to prevent and combat those phenomena and extremist movements, which pose a real threat to democratic values, and to increase their vigilance and be proactive in strengthening their efforts to recognize and effectively address those challenges; 32. Underlines the importance of data and statistics on racist and xenophobic crimes for identifying the types of offences committed, the profiles of victims and of perpetrators and whether the latter are affiliated with extremist movements or groups, thus enhancing better understanding of the phenomenon and identifying effective measures to address such racist and xenophobic crimes, and recalls in this regard the commitments made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development! on data, monitoring and accountability, including collecting disaggregated data; 33. Encourages States to adopt further measures to provide training for the police and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political parties, movements and groups whose advocacy constitutes incitement to racist and xenophobic violence, to strengthen their capacity to address racist and xenophobic crimes, to fulfil their responsibility for bringing to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and to combat impunity; 34. Expresses deep concern about the increased number of seats occupied by representatives of extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character in a number of national and local parliaments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for all democratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for human rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and to condemn all messages disseminating ideas that are based on racial superiority or 'S Resolution 70/1. 6/10 hatred and that have the objective of fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 35. Shares the concern of the Special Rapporteur regarding the resurgence of neo-Nazism in contemporary times and growing support for and acceptance of neo-Nazism and related ideology in an increasing number of countries, especially through the use of new digital technologies; 36.

Notes with appreciation, in this regard, the call of the Special Rapporteur upon political leaders and parties to strongly condemn incitement to racial discrimination or xenophobia, to promote tolerance and respect and to refrain from forming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character; !® 38. Welcomes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to withdraw support — financial and otherwise — from political parties and other organizations that engage in neo-Nazi or other hate speech or fail forcefully to condemn such speech by their members, and to take steps to dismantle responsible organizations where such hate speech aims, or can reasonably be expected to incite violence; 39. Expresses concern that ethnic profiling and police violence against persons in vulnerable situations discourage victims from seeking redress owing to distrust of the legal system, and in this regard encourages States to improve diversity within law enforcement agencies and to impose appropriate sanctions against those within the public service found guilty of racially motivated violence or of using hate speech; 40.
