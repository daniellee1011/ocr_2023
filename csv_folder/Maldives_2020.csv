States to leave no one behind, and recalling that the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration, is included as the standalone target 16.9 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable

organizations, professional associations, the media, the private sector and other members of civil society, including those involved in public-private partnerships, can also contribute to the

2018, on intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilation, and all other relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on the Status of Women on measures to eliminate traditional practices that are detrimental to women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, as well as Human Rights Council resolution 38/6 of 5 July 2018 GE.20-09247(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/44/L.20 on the elimination of female genital mutilation and other Council resolutions on the same topic, Recalling also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, Recalling further the commitment made by States to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, Recalling the annual commemoration of the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, on 6 February, with the aim to enhance awareness-raising campaigns and to take concrete action against female genital mutilation, Recognizing that, like all other harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation constitutes a human rights violation and a form of violence against women and girls that is mainly motivated and perpetuated by gender inequality and discriminatory social norms that jeopardize the recognition, enjoyment and exercise of their human rights and fundamental freedoms while posing a serious threat to their health and well-being, including physical integrity and mental, sexual and reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, Recognizing also that the practice has no documented health benefits and may, on the contrary, increase the risk of sickness and death, that it causes severe stress and shock, that it may give rise to post-partum and obstetric complications such as fistula or haemorrhage, and that it is likely to increase vulnerability to HIV and hepatitis B and C and to cause other health problems, Recognizing further that all harmful practices, including female genital mutilation, when perpetrated against girl children, have particular detrimental consequences on their health and growth, and recalling in that regard the need to guarantee the right of girl children to be free from all forms of violence, Recognizing that the practice of female genital mutilation continues to have an adverse effect not on only the economic, legal, health and social status of all women and girls, but also on the development of society as a whole, while the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, the full enjoyment of their human rights and their full, equal, effective and meaningful participation at all levels of decision-making are key to breaking the cycle of gender inequality, discrimination, gender-based violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, to sustainable development, Recognizing also that harmful practices such as female genital mutilation are an impediment to the full realization of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and to the respect for, and protection and fulfilment of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and the development of their full potential as equal partners with men and boys, as well as to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and convinced that such harmful practices seriously impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and human rights and prohibit gender- based discrimination and violence, Deeply concerned that, despite increased national, regional and international efforts, the harmful practice of female genital mutilation, like many other harmful practices, persists in all parts of the world, that it is exacerbated in humanitarian situations, armed conflicts, pandemics and other crises, and that new forms, such as medicalization and cross-border practice, are emerging, Recognizing that the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation is a national development, human rights and public health priority, thereby requiring a comprehensive and multisectoral approach based on States’ obligations under international human rights law and underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, accountability, participation, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, equality and non-discrimination, and international cooperation, A/HRC/44/L.20 Considering that holistic strategies to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation must be mainstreamed and coordinated both vertically and horizontally; that horizontal coordination requires the joint participation of organizations across sectors, including education, health, justice, social welfare, law enforcement, immigration and asylum, and communications and media, while vertical coordination brings together stakeholders at the national, subnational and local levels, including, inter alia, parliamentarians, national human rights institutions, traditional community leaders and religious authorities, women and girls, parents, legal guardians and families, health-care providers, civil society, human rights groups, youth organizations and men and boys, Recognizing that the practice constitutes torture or ill-treatment and must be prohibited, in accordance with regional and international human rights standards, Expressing deep concern about the lack of effective measures for prosecuting perpetrators, providing victims and survivors of female genital mutilation with access to remedies and redress, health care and health services, mental health and psychosocial counselling, legal assistance and socioeconomic reintegration services, Noting that human rights accountability means not only the establishment of protection measures ensuring criminal liability and the provision of legal remedies, but also the implementation of a broad range of other measures in the design, implementation and monitoring of policies, programmes and services to ensure women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights with the full, equal active and meaningful participation of women and girls at risk of and affected by female genital mutilation, Noting with concern that many countries lack accurate and reliable data on female genital mutilation to inform planning and track progress in eliminating female genital mutilation, due to the absence of indicators in administrative data systems, the absence of robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track progress and the absence of standard guidelines on data collection, Bearing in mind the most recent global and national commitments made by States, including in the 2019 Ouagadougou call to action on eliminating female genital mutilation, and the 2019 Cairo call to action for the elimination of child marriage and female genital mutilation in Africa, to accelerate efforts to ensure the global elimination of the practice of female genital mutilation by 2030, Welcoming the growing global consensus on the need to take appropriate measures to prevent and eradicate female genital mutilation, and considering that this practice cannot be justified on religious or cultural grounds, Welcoming also initiatives, such as the Saleema initiative launched by the African Union, to galvanize political action, increase allocation of financial resources and strengthen partnerships to end female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned about studies indicating that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis could drive international, regional and national efforts away from the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation and other harmful practices, which could result in delayed programme implementation and at least 2 million additional cases of female genital mutilation that could have been averted by 2030, Reaffirming the obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and to prevent and eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation, and emphasizing in this regard the specific role of the different departments of government, the legislative branch and the judiciary at the national and subnational levels, Bearing in mind that States have primary responsibility for preventing and eliminating female genital mutilation and for achieving zero tolerance of the practice, A/HRC/44/L.20 1. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the expert group meeting on the elimination of female genital mutilation;! 2.

Also urges States to ensure the protection of and provision of support to women and girls subjected to, or at risk of, female genital mutilation and to address the underlying systemic and structural causes in which the harmful practice is rooted by establishing well- defined, comprehensive, rights-based, gender-responsive and multisectoral prevention and response strategies that include supportive legislation and policy, programme and budgetary measures based on integrated, coordinated and collective approaches combining political commitment, civil society engagement and accountability at the national, local and community levels; 4. Further urges States to ensure that national action plans and strategies on the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation are adequately resourced and include projected timelines for goals and incorporate clear targets and indicators for the effective monitoring, impact assessment and coordination of programmes among all relevant stakeholders and promote their participation, including the participation of affected women and girls, practising communities and non-governmental organizations, in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of such plans and strategies; 5. Encourages States to put in place national coordination mechanisms to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation and ensure their sustainability and effectiveness by recognizing, preferably by law, their convening authority and by providing them with adequate financial resources and capacities so that they can oversee the implementation of comprehensive and multisectoral strategies, national plans, policies and programmes; and mobilize relevant actors, including girls, women, parents, legal guardians and families, women’s organizations, health-care workers, youth groups, human rights groups, religious and traditional leaders, community leaders, men and boys and other members of civil society and national stakeholders as appropriate to participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of national efforts to prevent and end female genital mutilation and provide care for women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation; 6.

Expresses deep concern that inequalities are widening and there are not enough jobs, including quality jobs, and emphasizes that full and productive employment and decent work for young people play an important role in their empowerment and can contribute to, inter alia, the prevention of extremism, terrorism and social, economic and political instability, thus contributing to sustainable development and peace; 15.

Also recognizes the fundamental importance of international cooperation, including through technical cooperation, capacity-building and the exchange of relevant lessons learned and good practices, in advancing efforts towards the full realization of the right to work through inclusive, sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; 20. Calls upon States to put in place cohesive and comprehensive policies and to take the legislative and administrative measures necessary for the full realization of the right to work for all, including women by, inter alia, considering to undertake policy commitments and measures to obtain full and productive employment and decent work for all, including through the establishment, where appropriate, of institutions for that purpose and by further strengthening tools, such as job services and social dialogue mechanisms, while paying continuous attention to professional and technical training and initiatives to foster small and medium-sized enterprises, cooperatives and start-ups, including those that are owned by A/HRC/43/L.6 women, and considering investing in infrastructure, services and social protection systems to allow for and to promote equitable sharing of care responsibilities between men and women; 21. | Encourages States to adopt proactive employment policies and partnerships that aim at generating decent jobs, in particular for young people, and to consider putting in place specialized services that assist them in identifying and securing available employment, including by providing access to information channels, technology and job search mechanisms, and that promote equality and accessibility; 22. Acknowledges that the promotion of greater involvement by young people, without any discrimination in policymaking, law-making processes and in the leadership of workers’ and employers’ organizations, is called for so that their views are taken into account; 23. Highlights the vital role of the private sector in generating new investments, job opportunities and financing for development and in advancing efforts towards the full realization of the right to work and the promotion of inclusive, sustained economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all, noting the multi-year strategy of the United Nations Global Compact to drive business awareness and action in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and Addis Ababa Action Agenda by 2030, and noting the need to promote the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Women’s Empowerment Principles established by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, as applicable; 24. Recognizes the important contribution of workers’ and employers’ organizations in the area of full and productive employment and decent work for all, and the importance of promoting equitable representation, participation and leadership in such organizations; 25. | Underscores that there is an urgent need to create an environment at the national and international levels that is conducive to the attainment of full and productive employment and decent work for all as a foundation for sustainable development, and that an environment that supports investment, growth and entrepreneurship is essential to the creation of new job opportunities for women and men, and reaffirms that opportunities for all to obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity are essential to ensure the eradication of hunger and poverty, the realization of equality between women and men, the improvement of economic and social well-being for all, the achievement of sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and sustainable development; 26. Calls upon States to continue their efforts to prevent and combat all forms of discrimination and violence, including sexual harassment at the workplace, including by adopting and implementing laws and policies and through training, awareness-raising and support for women’s access to justice with respect to violence and sexual harassment, bearing in mind that these continue to be among the factors that have an adverse impact on the realization of the right to work for women; 27.

70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing

environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, A/HRC/45/L.48 Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned

standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, or primary caregivers and legal guardians, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental,

disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with

epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1.
