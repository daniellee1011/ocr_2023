Considers it intolerable that more than 6 million children still die every year from hunger-related illness before their fifth birthday and that there are about 854 million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 9 See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report on the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006 (Rome, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006). 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Pérto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (c 2006/REP), appendix G.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; A/C.3/62/L.53/Rev.1 21. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 22. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 23.

Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 25.

A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 Annex Supplement to the World Programme of Action for Youth I. Globalization 1. Globalization has opened new opportunities for sustained economic growth and the development of the world economy. Globalization has also permitted countries to share experiences and to learn from one another’s achievements and difficulties and has promoted a cross-fertilization of ideas, cultural values and aspirations. Globalization has thus helped to connect youth not only to the rest of the world, but also with each other. 2. At the same time, the rapid processes of change and adjustment of globalization have been accompanied by intensified poverty, unemployment and social disintegration. Threats to human well-being, such as environmental risks, have also been globalized. Some countries have successfully adapted to the changes and benefited from globalization, but many others, especially least developed countries, have remained marginalized in the globalized world economy. The benefits are very unevenly shared, while the costs are unevenly distributed. Globalization should be fully inclusive and equitable. There is a strong need for appropriate policies and measures at the national and international levels to help countries respond effectively to the challenges of globalization and the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. 3. Many young people, especially in developing countries, remain marginalized from the global economy and lack the capabilities to access the opportunities that globalization offers. Many are restricted by inadequate education, limited skills, unemployment and poverty or are outside the reach of basic information and communication and the goods and services that have become available with globalization. Proposals for action Managing the effects of globalization on youth 4. The international community should continue to support the efforts of Governments, together with civil society, including youth-led organizations, the private sector and other parts of society, to anticipate and offset the negative social and economic consequences of globalization and to maximize its benefits for young people. 5. Governments should ensure that access of youth to technical, secondary and higher education is improved and that curricula are adapted to meet the needs of a rapidly changing labour market associated with globalization. The transition from learning to work should also be facilitated. 6. Governments should foster the conditions that provide opportunities, jobs and social services for youth in their home countries. Efforts should be made to guarantee that young migrants enjoy full respect for their human rights, including fair and equal treatment with others and the protection of law against, inter alia, violence, exploitation and discrimination such as racism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 and cultural intolerance, and access to economic opportunities and social services, as appropriate. Promoting youth employment and skills development in the context of globalization 7. In order to overcome the mismatch between the skills that youth possess and the specialized demands of labour markets shaped by _ globalization, Governments, with appropriate support from the international community, should provide funding and opportunities in both formal and non-formal education for youth to acquire requisite skills, including through skills development programmes. 8. At the same time, Governments should promote access to work through integrated policies that enable the creation of new and quality jobs for young people and that facilitate access to those jobs. Establishing ways of monitoring systems to track the effects of globalization on youth 9. Governments should assess the extent to which the benefits of globalization are accessible to youth and should design and implement programmes to enable youth to better harness the benefits of globalization. II. Information and communications technology 10. Information and communications technology (ICT) and infrastructures are growing in importance as a part of everyday business and interaction. This process can be enhanced by removing barriers to universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to information, which hinder the bridging of the digital divide, particularly those that impede the full achievement of the economic, social and cultural development of countries and the welfare of their people, especially youth, in particular in developing countries. ICT has enormous potential to expand access to quality education, to boost literacy and universal primary education and to facilitate the learning process itself, thus laying the groundwork for the establishment of a fully inclusive and development-oriented information society and knowledge economy that respects cultural and linguistic diversity. 11. Youth have a particular interest and ability with regard to modern technology. ICT can empower youth by providing them with the opportunity to overcome the barriers of distance and socio-economic disadvantage. Through the Internet, for example, young people can have access to information on a range of issues that directly affect them, including health, education and employment. This information can be used to improve the quality of life of youth and their communities. This process can be facilitated if Governments, civil society, the private sector, families, youth-led organizations and other groups work together to open up avenues for a cultural and social exchange among young people. Governments can also capitalize on the interest of the young in ICT to alleviate poverty. For example, youth can become engaged not only in the use of ICT, but also in the development and engineering of locally relevant software design and hardware. A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 12. ICT offers new ways to address the needs of youth with disabilities who cannot access traditional sources of information and employment. Vulnerable groups of the population can capitalize on ICT to make a better connection with society and advance their education and employment opportunities. Proposals for action Making information and communications technology available to all youth 13. Governments, supported by the international community, as appropriate, should facilitate access to ICT for all youth, including those in difficult-to-reach areas, such as rural areas, and in indigenous communities. Governments should evaluate inequalities in access that exist between urban and rural youth and between young women and men and should develop national strategies to overcome the “digital divide” in each country, thus decreasing the proportion of youth who have no access to ICT. 14. Governments should develop domestic policies to ensure that ICT is fully and appropriately integrated into education and training at all levels, including in the development of curricula, teacher training and institutional administration and management, as well as in support of the concept of lifelong learning. 15. Governments, with the support of the international community, should promote and encourage local knowledge systems, and locally produced content in media and communications, support the development of a wide range of ICT-based programmes in local languages, as appropriate, with content relevant to different groups of young persons, especially young women, and build the capacity of girls and women to develop ICT. Providing training to facilitate use of information and communications technology 16. Governments, in collaboration with relevant actors in the information society, should ensure that young people are equipped with knowledge and skills to use ICT appropriately, including the capacity to analyse and treat information in creative and innovative ways, to share their expertise and to participate fully in the information society. Efforts should be made to provide special training courses for in-school and out-of-school youth to enable them to become conversant with ICT and to facilitate their use of such technologies. Protecting youth from the harmful aspects of information and communications technology 17. Governments should strengthen action to protect youth from abuse and to defend their rights in the context of the use of ICT. In that context, the best interests of youth are a primary consideration. Governments should promote responsible behaviour and raise awareness of possible risks for young people arising from the harmful aspects of ICT in order that they may protect themselves from possible exploitation and injury. 18. Governments, in cooperation with relevant actors of information society, should strengthen action to protect children and youth from abuse and the harmful impact of ICT, in particular through cybercrimes, including child pornography. A/C.3/62/L.7/Rev.1 Promoting the use of information and communications technology by persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups 19. Governments should facilitate the development of ICT capacity for youth, including indigenous youth, youth with disabilities and youth in remote and rural communities. 20. Governments should initiate the development and use of special technical and legal arrangements to make ICT accessible to all youth, including indigenous youth, youth with disabilities and youth in remote and rural communities. Empowering young people as key contributors to building an inclusive information society 21. Governments should actively engage youth in innovative ICT-based development programmes and should widen opportunities for youth involvement in e-strategy processes in a manner that encourages youth to assume leadership roles. The role of youth in creating, repairing, managing and maintaining ICT should also be recognized and encouraged. 22. Bearing in mind that literacy and numeracy are preconditions for access to and effective use of ICT, Governments should promote opportunities through formal and non-formal channels for young persons to acquire the appropriate knowledge. 23. ICT should also be used to enhance education, employment and youth participation in the decision-making process. ICT should be used to improve the quality of education and to better prepare youth for the demands of the information society. II. HIV/AIDS 24. The HIV/AIDS epidemic is increasingly a problem of youth, especially in parts of the developing world. Governments have noted with grave concern the fact that new HIV infections are heavily concentrated among youth and that there is a lack of information available to help youth understand their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, in order to increase their ability to protect themselves from HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases and to prevent unwanted pregnancies. 25. Young people, especially young women in Africa, face especially high risks of HIV infection. Young people and women are particularly vulnerable to infection owing to their lack of economic and social power and their lack of the capability to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality in order to increase their ability to protect themselves from HIV infections. They often lack the tools and information required to avoid infection and cope with AIDS. In 2006, women and girls made up 57 per cent of all people infected with HIV in sub- Saharan Africa, where a striking 76 per cent of young people (aged 15-24) living with HIV are female. 26. Although many children orphaned by AIDS have not yet entered the youth age groups, they are at great risk of becoming youth with severe vulnerabilities. They are subject to malnutrition, illness, abuse, child labour and 10 sexual exploitation, and these factors increase their vulnerability to HIV infection. They also suffer the stigma and discrimination often associated with HIV/AIDS and may be denied education, work, housing and other basic needs as a result. 27. It is imperative that young people continue to have access to evidence- and skills-based youth-specific HIV education to enable them to avoid high-risk behaviour. In some regions youth, especially girls, play a key role in caring for HIV/AIDS patients or their orphans. To ensure that young caregivers stay in school, build their skills and have the chance to generate an income, Governments should provide economic and social support to families that rely on young caregivers as well as support for improving home- and community-based care. 28. Because youth often lack decision-making power and financial resources, they may be the last to receive treatment if they become infected. Programmes should scale up the provision of treatment as part of the promotion of the highest attainable standards of health. 29. It is essential for Governments to implement fully the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session in 2001,! and to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015. In addition, Governments should implement the commitments dealing with HIV/AIDS reached at all major United Nations conferences and summits, including the 2005 World Summit and the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS held on 2 June 2006,2 at which Member States committed themselves to scaling up responses directed towards achieving the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010 and towards achieving the goal of universal access to reproductive health by 2015, as set out at the International Conference on Population and Development. Proposals for action Raising awareness about HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment for youth 30. Governments should ensure that prevention of HIV infection is the mainstay of national, regional and international responses to the pandemic and should therefore commit themselves to intensifying efforts to ensure that a wide range of prevention programmes, which take into account local circumstances, ethics and cultural values, are available in all countries, in particular the most affected countries, including: information, education and communications, in languages most understood within communities and with respect for their cultures, aimed at reducing risk-taking behaviours and encouraging responsible sexual behaviour, including abstinence and fidelity; expanded access to essential commodities, including male and female condoms and sterile injecting equipment; harm-reduction efforts related to drug use; expanded access to voluntary and confidential counselling and testing; safe blood supplies; and early and effective treatment of sexually transmitted infections. 1 Resolution S-26/2, annex. 2 See resolution 60/262, annex. 11 31. Governments should commit themselves to addressing the rising rates of HIV infection among young people in order to ensure that future generations may be free of HIV infection through the implementation of comprehensive evidence-based prevention strategies, responsible sexual behaviour, including the use of condoms, evidence- and skills-based youth-specific HIV education, mass media interventions and the provision of youth-friendly health services. 32. Governments should provide access to the highest attainable standards of affordable and youth-friendly health care in order to increase the capacities of young people to protect themselves from the risk of HIV infection, principally through the provision of health care and health services, including for sexual and reproductive health, in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development,? that integrate HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care and include confidential voluntary counselling and testing and involve young people in the planning, implementation and evaluation of those efforts. 33. Governments should promote initiatives aimed at reducing the prices of antiretroviral drugs, especially second-line drugs, available to young people, including initiatives undertaken on a voluntary basis by groups of Member States based on innovative financing mechanisms that contribute to the mobilization of resources for social development, including those that aim to provide further drug access at affordable prices to developing countries on a sustainable and predictable basis. 34. In recognition of the fact that HIV/AIDS is increasingly affecting youth in both developed and developing countries, all efforts should be made, in full partnership with young persons, parents, families, educators and health-care providers, to ensure that youth have access to accurate information, education, including peer education and youth-specific HIV education, and services necessary to develop the life skills required to reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection. 35. Governments should involve young people, including youth living with HIV/AIDS, inter alia, through their respective youth organizations and, as appropriate, with the support of their families, in the decision-making, planning, implementation and evaluation of HIV/AIDS prevention and care programmes. 36. Governments should ensure that prevention programmes include counselling for those who are infected with HIV in order to ensure that they take appropriate precautions to prevent the spread of the virus and to help them cope with the effects of living with HIV/AIDS. Supporting universal HIV/AIDS education, taking gender inequalities into account 37. Trafficking of women and girls for prostitution and sexual slavery increases the vulnerability of young women to HIV/AIDS infection and is linked to the widespread feminization of poverty, sex tourism, sweatshops and other detrimental consequences of globalization. Governments should devise, enforce and strengthen effective youth-sensitive measures to combat, eliminate and prosecute all forms of trafficking in women and girls, including for sexual and economic 3 Report of the International Conference on Population and Development, Cairo, 5-13 September 1994 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.95.XIII.18), chap. I, resolution 1, annex. 12 exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy within wider efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. 38. Governments should include appropriate information in school curricula and non-formal training programmes on the effects of high-risk behaviour, including intravenous drug use, on the transmission of HIV infection. 39. Governments should give special attention, in all programmes aimed at providing information about and preventing HIV/AIDS among youth, to aspects of gender and to the disproportionate vulnerability of girls and young women. Legislation and legal instruments to protect vulnerable youth 40. Governments should ensure non-discrimination and full and equal enjoyment of all human rights through the promotion of an active and visible policy of destigmatization of children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS. 41. Governments should strengthen legal, policy, administrative and other measures for the promotion and protection of the full enjoyment of all human rights by youth, the protection of their dignity and the reduction of their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS through the elimination of all forms of discrimination and all types of sexual exploitation of young girls and boys, including for commercial reasons, as well as all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful traditional and customary practices, abuse, rape and other forms of sexual violence, battering and trafficking in women and girls. 42. Governments should intensify efforts to enact, strengthen or enforce, as appropriate, legislation, regulations and other measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by youth living with HIV, including policies to secure their access to education, inheritance, employment, health care, social and health services, prevention, support and treatment, information and legal protection, while respecting their privacy and confidentiality and developing strategies to combat the stigma and social exclusion connected with the epidemic. IV. Armed conflict 43. Development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. The scale of the violence perpetrated against civilians, including youth, in the past couple of decades is extremely worrisome. Armed conflicts have resulted in killings, the massive displacement of people, including youth, and the destruction of communities, which has impacted negatively on their development. 44. Youth are often among the main victims of armed conflict. Children and youth are killed or maimed, made orphans, abducted, taken hostage, forcibly displaced, deprived of education and health care and left with deep emotional scars and trauma. Children illegally recruited as child soldiers are often forced to commit serious abuses. Armed conflict destroys the safe environment provided by a house, a family, adequate nutrition, education and employment. During conflict, health risks increase among youth, especially young women. Young women and girls face additional risks, in particular those of sexual violence and exploitation. 13 45. During conflict, young men and women who are forced to take on “adult” roles miss out on opportunities for personal or professional development. When conflict ends, many of the young people who must make the transition to adulthood while dealing with the traumas of war are at the same time required to adapt quickly to their new roles, often as parents and caretakers of the victims of war. Without services to help them deal with their situation, youth and young adults may fail to integrate into society. Proposals for action Protecting youth under age 18 from direct involvement in armed conflict 46. Governments should ensure that children benefit from an early age from education about values, attitudes, modes of behaviour and ways of life in order to enable them to resolve any dispute peacefully and in a spirit of respect for human dignity, with tolerance and non-discrimination. Governments should promote a culture of peace, tolerance and dialogue, including in both formal and non-formal education. 47. Governments should consider, as a matter of priority, the ratification and effective implementation of the Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour 1999 (Convention No. 182) of the International Labour Organization. 48. Governments should take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take direct part in hostilities and that those who have not attained the age of 18 years are not compulsorily recruited into their armed forces. 49. Governments should take all necessary measures, in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law, as a matter of priority, to prevent the recruitment and use of children by armed groups, as distinct from the armed forces of a State, including the adoption of policies that do not tolerate the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict, and the legal measures necessary to prohibit and criminalize such practices. 50. Governments should protect young persons in situations of armed conflict, post-conflict settings and settings involving refugees and internally displaced persons, where youth are at risk of violence and where their ability to seek and receive redress is often restricted, bearing in mind that peace is inextricably linked with equality between young women and young men and development, that armed and other types of conflicts and terrorism and hostage-taking still persist in many parts of the world, and that aggression, foreign occupation and ethnic and other types of conflicts are an ongoing reality affecting young persons in nearly every region from which they need to be protected. Providing for the reintegration of youth ex-combatants and protection of non-combatants 51. Governments should provide opportunities for all youth who have been engaged in active combat, whether voluntarily or by force, to demobilize and contribute to society’s development if they seek to do so. In this regard, Governments should establish programmes to provide opportunities for youth 14 ex-combatants to retool and retrain so as to facilitate their employment in economic activity and their reintegration into society, including family reunification. 52. Governments should take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children and young victims of armed conflicts, in particular by restoring access of those children and youth to health care and education, including through “Education for All” programmes, as well as to put in place effective youth employment strategies to help provide a decent living for young people and to facilitate their reintegration into society. Promoting active involvement of youth in maintaining peace and security 53. Governments should encourage the involvement of young people, where appropriate, in activities concerning the protection of children and youth affected by armed conflict, including programmes for reconciliation, peace consolidation and peacebuilding. V. Intergenerational issues 54. Many aspects of the demographic transition, global economic development and_ globalization have influenced opportunities for the intergenerational exchange of knowledge, ideas and resources. The increase in lifespan implies that many adults may be able to share knowledge and resources with younger generations over a longer period of time. In recent times, greater longevity has resulted in situations where many older people live for longer periods in some form of dependency on younger generations. On the other hand, trends in globalization and development have resulted in situations where many young people are cut off from their families. In many developing countries and countries with economies in transition, it is the ageing population that is dominant in rural areas owing to the exodus of young adults. Older persons may be left behind without the traditional support of families and even without adequate financial resources. While older persons lose opportunities to receive support from younger members of families, younger persons also lose opportunities to benefit from the knowledge and guidance of older members of their families. 55. At the family and community levels, intergenerational ties can be valuable for everyone. Individual and family choices, geographical mobility and the pressures of contemporary life can keep people apart, yet the great majority of people in all cultures maintain close relations with their families throughout their lives. These relationships work in both directions, with older persons often providing significant contributions financially, emotionally and in respect of the education and care of grandchildren and other kin, thereby making a crucial contribution to the stability of the family unit. 56. The weakening of intergenerational connections in the context of ageing societies implies that various needs of youth, children and older persons, which may have been supported through intricate and complex familial relationships, are increasingly not being met and are instead becoming the responsibility of the State or the private sector. 57. It is therefore incumbent on Governments and relevant sectors of society to develop programmes that renew or restore intergenerational solidarity. Where there has already been substantial erosion of the ability of communities to meet this 15 objective, Governments should intervene to ensure that basic needs for protection are met. Proposals for action Strengthening families 58. While respecting individual preferences for living arrangements, all sectors of society, including Governments, should develop programmes to strengthen families and to foster intergenerational relations. Empowering young women 59. Governments should promote greater participation by young women in the labour force, including those living in rural and remote areas, by providing and developing the necessary skills to enable them to find employment, especially through taking measures to eliminate male and female stereotypes and through promoting role models, and to facilitate better reconciliation of work and family life. Strengthening intergenerational solidarity 60. Government and private sector businesses should capitalize on the opportunity to use the experience and skills of older workers to train younger and newer employees. 61. Governments should promote equality and _ solidarity between generations, including by offering young people full and effective participation in poverty eradication, employment creation and social integration programmes within their societies. 62. All sectors of society should be encouraged to develop reciprocity in learning, which provides older persons with opportunities to learn from younger generations. 63. Where traditional forms of social support have been reduced by migration, globalization and related situations, Governments should work with non- governmental organizations and the private sector to provide assistance and support to older caregivers, especially those providing care for HIV/AIDS orphans, in meeting the needs of their children and grandchildren. 64. Governments should take steps to strengthen solidarity among generations and intergenerational partnerships through the promotion of activities that support intergenerational communication and understanding, and should encourage mutually responsive relationships between generations. 65. The full and effective participation of young people and youth organizations at the local, national, regional and international levels is important for the realization of the Millennium Development Goals, the promotion and implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth, and the evaluation of the progress achieved and the obstacles encountered in its implementation, and for support of the activities of mechanisms that have been set up by young people and youth organizations. Governments should encourage their participation in actions and decisions and in strengthening efforts to implement the World Programme of Action, bearing in mind that girls, boys, young women and young men have the same rights, but different needs and strengths, and that they are active agents in decision-making processes and for positive change and development in society. 07-60110 16",11/15/2007,2007_612309,Nigeria,N/A,yes

Noting also that many thousands of suspects and prisoners are detained for lengthy periods of time in over-crowded police cells and in inhumane conditions in over-crowded prisons; Further noting that prolonged incarceration of suspects and prisoners without providing access to legal aid or to the courts violates basic principles of international law and human rights, and that legal aid to suspects and prisoners has the potential to reduce the length of time suspects are held in police stations, congestion in the courts, and prison populations, thereby improving conditions of confinement and reducing the costs of criminal justice administration and incarceration; Recalling the Resolution of the African Charter of Fundamental Rights of Prisoners adopted by the African Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice held at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in March, 2004 and its recommendations for its adoption by the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to be held in Bangkok, Thailand in April, 2005; Mindful that the challenge of providing legal aid and assistance to ordinary people will require the participation of a variety of legal services providers and partnerships with a range of stakeholders and require the creation of innovative legal aid mechanisms; Noting the Kampala Declaration on Prison Conditions 1996, the Kadoma Declaration on Community Service Orders in Africa 1997, the Abuja Declaration on Alternatives to Imprisonment 2002 and the Ouagadougou Declaration on Accelerating Prison and Penal Reform in Africa 2002; and mindful that similar measures are needed with respect to the provision of legal aid to prisoners; E/CN.15/2007/L.16 Noting with satisfaction the resolutions passed by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (notably: the Resolution on the Right of Recourse and Fair Trial 1992, the Resolution on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa 1999) and, in particular, the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa 2001; Commending the practical steps that have been taken to implement these standards through the activities of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and its Special Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention; Commending also the Recommendation of the African Regional Preparatory Meeting held at Addis Ababa in March 2004 that the African Region should prepare and present an African Common Position to the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to be held in Bangkok, Thailand in April, 2005, and that the African Union Commission has agreed to prepare and present that Common Position to the Congress; Welcoming the practical measures that have been taken by the governments and legal aid establishments in African countries to apply these standards in their national jurisdictions; while emphasizing that notwithstanding these measures, there are still considerable shortcomings in the provision of legal aid to ordinary people, which are aggravated by shortages of personnel and resources; Noting with satisfaction the growing openness of governments to forging partnerships with non-governmental organizations, civil society, and the international community in developing legal aid programs for ordinary people that will enable increasing numbers of people in Africa, especially in rural areas, to have access to justice; Commending also the recommendations of the African Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Eleventh United Nations Conference for the introduction and strengthening of restorative justice in the criminal justice system; E/CN.15/2007/L.16 The participants of the Conference on Legal Aid in Criminal Justice: the Role of Lawyers, Non-Lawyers and other Service Providers in Africa, held in Lilongwe, Malawi, between 22 and 24 November 2004, hereby declare the importance of: 1. Recognising and supporting the right to legal aid in criminal justice All governments have the primary responsibility to recognise and support basic human rights, including the provision of and access to legal aid for persons in the criminal justice system. As part of this responsibility, governments are encouraged to adopt measures and allocate funding sufficient to ensure an effective and transparent method of delivering legal aid to the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children, and in so doing empower them to access justice. Legal aid should be defined as broadly as possible to include legal advice, assistance, representation, education, and mechanisms for alternative dispute resolution; and to include a wide range of stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, religious and non-religious charitable organizations, professional bodies and associations, and academic institutions. 2. Sensitizing all criminal justice stakeholders Government officials, including police and prison administrators, judges, lawyers, and prosecutors, should be made aware of the crucial role that legal aid plays in the development and maintenance of a just and fair criminal justice system. Since those in control of government criminal justice agencies control access to detainees and to prisoners, they should ensure that the right to legal aid is fully implemented. Government officials are encouraged to allow legal aid to be provided at police stations, in pre-trial detention facilities, in courts, and in prisons. Governments should also sensitize criminal justice system administrators to the societal benefits of providing effective legal aid and the use of alternatives to imprisonment. These benefits include elimination of unnecessary detention, speedy processing of cases, fair and impartial trials, and the reduction of prison populations. E/CN.15/2007/L.16 3. Providing legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process A legal aid program should include legal assistance at all stages of the criminal process including investigation, arrest, pre-trial detention, bail hearings, trials, appeals, and other proceedings brought to ensure that human rights are protected. Suspects, accused persons, and detainees should have access to legal assistance immediately upon arrest and/or detention wherever such arrest and/or detention occurs. A person subject to criminal proceedings should never be prevented from securing legal aid and should always be granted the right to see and consult with a lawyer, accredited para-legal, or legal assistant. Governments should ensure that legal aid programs provide special attention to persons who are detained without charge, or beyond the expiration of their sentences, or who have been held in detention or in prison without access to the courts. Special attention should be given to women and other vulnerable groups, such as children, young people, the elderly, persons with disabilities, persons living with HIV/AIDS, the mentally and seriously ill, refugees, internally displaced persons, and foreign nationals. 4. Recognising the right to redress for violations of human rights Human rights are enforced when government officials know that they will be held accountable for violations of the law and of basic human rights. Persons who are abused or injured by law enforcement officials, or who are not afforded proper recognition of their human rights, should have access to the courts and legal representation to redress their injuries and grievances. Governments should provide legal aid to persons who seek compensation for injuries suffered as the result of misconduct by officials and employees of criminal justice systems. This does not exclude other stakeholders from providing legal aid in such cases. 5. Recognising the role of non-formal means of conflict resolution Traditional and community-based alternatives to formal criminal processes have the potential to resolve disputes without acrimony and to restore social cohesion within the community. These mechanisms also have the potential to reduce reliance upon the police to enforce the law, to reduce congestion in the courts, and E/CN.15/2007/L.16 to reduce the reliance upon incarceration as a means of resolving conflict based upon alleged criminal activity. All stakeholders should recognise the significance of such diversionary measures to the administration of a community-based, victim- oriented criminal justice system and should provide support for such mechanisms provided that they conform to human rights norms. 6. Diversifying legal aid delivery systems Each country has different capabilities and needs when consideration is given to what kind of legal aid systems to employ. In carrying out its responsibility to provide equitable access to justice for poor and vulnerable people, there are a variety of service delivery options that can be considered. These include government funded public defender offices, judicare programmes, justice centres, law clinics - as well as partnerships with civil society and _ faith-based organizations. Whatever options are chosen, they should be structured and funded in a way that preserves their independence and commitment to those populations most in need. Appropriate coordinating mechanisms should be established. 7. Diversifying legal aid service providers It has all too often been observed that there are not enough lawyers in African countries to provide the legal aid services required by the hundreds of thousands of persons who are affected by criminal justice systems. It is also widely recognised that the only feasible way of delivering effective legal aid to the maximum number of persons is to rely on non-lawyers, including law students, para-legals, and legal assistants. These para-legals and legal assistants can provide access to the justice system for persons subjected to it, assist criminal defendants, and provide knowledge and training to those affected by the system that will enable rights to be effectively asserted. An effective legal aid system should employ complementary legal and law-related services by para-legals and legal assistants. 10 8. Encouraging pro-bono provision of legal aid by lawyers It is universally recognised that lawyers are officers of the court and have a duty to see that justice systems operate fairly and equitably. By involving a broad spectrum of the private bar in the provision of legal aid, such services will be recognised as an important duty of the legal profession. The organized bar should provide substantial moral, professional and logistical support to those providing legal aid. Where a bar association, licensing agency, or government has the option of making pro-bono provision of legal aid mandatory, this step should be taken. In countries in which a mandatory pro-bono requirement cannot be imposed, members of the legal profession should be strongly encouraged to provide pro-bono legal aid services. 9. Guaranteeing sustainability of legal aid Legal aid services in many African countries are donor funded and may be terminated at any time. For this reason, there is need for sustainability. Sustainability includes: funding, the provision of professional services, establishment of infrastructure, and the ability to satisfy the needs of the relevant community in the long term. Appropriate government, private sector and other funding, and community ownership arrangements should be established in order to ensure sustainability of legal aid in every country. 10. Encouraging legal literacy Ignorance about the law, human rights, and the criminal justice system is a major problem in many African countries. People who do not know their legal rights are unable to enforce them and are subject to abuse in the criminal justice system. Governments should ensure that human rights education and legal literacy programmes are conducted in educational institutions and in non-formal sectors of society, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, young people, women, and the urban and rural poor. 11 Annex II* Lilongwe Plan of Action The participants recommend the following measures as forming part of a Plan of Action to implement the Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice system in Africa. The document is addressed to governments and criminal justice practitioners, criminologists, academics, development partners as well as non-governmental organizations, community based organizations and faith based groups active in this area. It is meant to be a source of inspiration for concrete actions. LEGAL AID FRAMEWORK Institution building GOVERNMENTS should introduce measures to: Establish a legal aid institution that is independent of government justice departments eg: legal aid board/commission that is accountable to parliament. Diversify legal aid service providers, adopting an inclusive approach, and enter into agreements with the Law Society as well as with university law clinics, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs) and faith-based groups to provide legal aid services. Encourage lawyers to provide pro bono legal aid services as an ethical duty. Establish a legal aid fund to administer public defender schemes, to support university law clinics; and to sponsor clusters of NGOs/CBOs and others to provide legal aid services throughout the country, especially in the rural areas. 12 e Agree minimum quality standards for legal aid services and clarify the role of paralegals and other service providers by: [e) [e) developing standardized training programmes monitoring and evaluating the work of paralegals and other service providers requiring all paralegals operating in the criminal justice system to submit to a code of conduct establishing effective referral mechanisms to lawyers for all these service providers. Public awareness Governments should introduce measures to: Incorporate human rights and ‘Rule of Law’ topics in _ national educational curricula in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations Decade of Human Rights Education. Develop a national media campaign focusing on legal literacy in consultation with civil society organizations and media groups. Sensitise the public and justice agencies on the broadened definition of legal aid and the role all service providers have to play (through TV, radio, the printed media, seminars and workshops). Institute one day a year as ‘Legal Aid Day’ Legislation Governments should: e Enact legislation to promote the right of everyone to basic legal advice, assistance and education, especially for victims of crime and vulnerable groups. Enact legislation to establish an independent national legal aid institution accountable to Parliament and protected from executive interference. Enact legislation to ensure the provision of legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process. 13 Enact legislation to recognize the role of non-lawyers and paralegals and to clarify their duties. Enact legislation to recognize customary law and the role non State justice fora can play in appropriate cases (ie where cases are diverted from the formal criminal justice process) Sustainability Governments should introduce measures to: Diversify the funding-base of legal aid institutions that should be primarily funded by governments, to include endowment funds by donors, companies and communities. Identify fiscal mechanisms for channelling funds to the legal aid fund, such as: o recovering costs in civil legal aid cases where the legal aid litigant has been awarded costs in a matter and channelling such recovered costs into the legal aid fund o taxing any award made in civil legal aid cases and channelling the moneys paid into the legal aid fund o fixing a percentage of the State’s criminal justice budget to be allocated to legal aid services. Identify incentives for lawyers to work in rural areas (eg tax exemptions / reductions). Require all law students to participate in a legal aid clinic or other legal aid community service scheme as part of their professional or national service requirement. Request the Law Society to organize regular circuits of lawyers around the country to provide free legal advice and assistance. Promote partnerships with NGOs, CBOs, faith-based groups and, where appropriate, local councils. 14 LEGAL AID IN ACTION In the police station Governments should introduce measures to: Provide legal and/or paralegal services in police stations in consultation with the Police Service, the Law Society, university law clinics and NGOs. These services might include: [e) providing general advice and assistance at the police station to victims of crime as well as accused persons visiting police cells or lock-ups (cachots) monitoring custody time limits in the police station after which a person must be produced before the court attending at police interview screening juveniles for possible diversion programmes contacting / tracing parents / guardians / sureties assisting with bail from the police station. e Require the police to co-operate with service providers and advertise these services and how to access them in each police station. At court Governments should introduce measures to: Draw up rosters for lawyers to attend court on fixed days in consultation with the Law Society and provide services free of charge. Encourage the judiciary to take a more pro-active role in ensuring the defendant is provided with legal aid and able to put his/her case where the person is unrepresented because of indigency. Promote the wider use of alternative dispute resolution and diversion of criminal cases and encourage the judiciary to consider such options as a first step in all matters. 15 Encourage non-lawyers, paralegals and victim support agencies to provide basic advice and assistance and to conduct regular observations of trial proceedings. Conduct regular case reviews to clear case backlogs, petty cases and refer/divert appropriate cases for mediation; and convene regular meetings of all criminal justice agencies to find local solutions to local problems. In prison Governments should introduce measures to ensure that: Magistrates/judges screen the remand caseload on a regular basis to make sure that people are remanded lawfully, their cases are being expedited, and that they are held appropriately. Prison officers, judicial officers, lawyers, paralegals and non-lawyers conduct periodic census to determine who is in prison and whether they are there as a first rather than a last resort. Custody time limits are enacted. Paralegal services are established in prisons. Services should include: o legal education of prisoners so as to allow them to understand the law, process and apply this learning in their own case o assistance with bail and the identification of potential sureties o assistance with appeals o special assistance to vulnerable groups, especially to women, women with babies, young persons, refugees and foreign nationals, the aged, terminally and mentally ill etc. Access to prisons for responsible NGOs, CBOs and faith-based groups is not subject to unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. In the village Governments should introduce measures to: e Encourage NGOs, CBOs and faith-based groups to train local leaders on the law and constitution and in particular the rights of women and 16 children; and in mediation and other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures. Establish referral mechanisms between the court and village hearings. Such mechanisms might include: o diversion from the court to the village for the offender to make an apology or engage in a victim-offender mediation; o referral from the court to the village to make restitution and/or offer compensation o appeals from the village to the court. Establish a Chief's Council, or similar body of traditional leaders, in order to provide greater consistency in traditional approaches to justice. Record traditional proceedings and provide village hearings (‘courts’) with the tools for documenting proceedings. Provide a voice for women in traditional proceedings. Include customary law in the training of lawyers. In post-conflict societies Governments should introduce measures to: Recruit judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, police and prison officers in peace- keeping operations and programmes of national reconstruction. Include the services of national NGOs, CBOs and faith-based groups in the re-establishment of the criminal justice system especially where the need for speed is paramount. Consult with traditional, religious and community leaders and identify common values on which peace-keeping should be based. 17",04/23/2007,2007_613517,Nigeria,* The present annex is reproduced in the form in which it was received. * The present annex is reproduced in the form in which it was received.,yes

E/CN.15/2007/L.16/Rev.1 Annex I* Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice System in Africa Conference on Legal Aid in Criminal Justice: the Role of Lawyers, Non-Lawyers and other Service Providers in Africa Lilongwe, Malawi November 22-24, 2004 128 delegates from 26 countries including 21 African countries met between 22-24 November 2004 in Lilongwe, Malawi, to discuss legal aid services in the criminal justice systems in Africa. Ministers of State, judges, lawyers, prison commissioners, academics, international, regional, and national non-governmental organizations attended the conference. The three days of deliberations produced the Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice System in Africa (set forth below), which was adopted by consensus at the closure of the Conference with the request that it be forwarded to national governments, the African Union Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the African Union Commission, and the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to be held in Bangkok in April, 2005, and publicized to national and regional legal aid networks. Preamble Bearing in mind that access to justice depends on the enforcement of rights to due process, to a fair hearing, and to legal representation; Recognising that the vast majority of people affected by the criminal justice system are poor and have no resources with which to protect their rights; Further recognising that the vast majority of ordinary people in Africa, especially in post-conflict societies where there is no functioning criminal justice system, do not have access to legal aid or to the courts and that the principle of equal legal representation and access to the resources and protections of the criminal justice E/CN.15/2007/L.16/Rev.1 system simply does not exist as it applies to the vast majority of persons affected by the criminal justice system; Noting that legal advice and assistance in police stations and prisons are absent. Noting also that many thousands of suspects and prisoners are detained for lengthy periods of time in over-crowded police cells and in inhumane conditions in over-crowded prisons; Further noting that prolonged incarceration of suspects and prisoners without providing access to legal aid or to the courts violates basic principles of international law and human rights, and that legal aid to suspects and prisoners has the potential to reduce the length of time suspects are held in police stations, congestion in the courts, and prison populations, thereby improving conditions of confinement and reducing the costs of criminal justice administration and incarceration; Recalling the Resolution of the African Charter of Fundamental Rights of Prisoners adopted by the African Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice held at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in March, 2004 and its recommendations for its adoption by the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to be held in Bangkok, Thailand in April, 2005; Mindful that the challenge of providing legal aid and assistance to ordinary people will require the participation of a variety of legal services providers and partnerships with a range of stakeholders and require the creation of innovative legal aid mechanisms; Noting the Kampala Declaration on Prison Conditions 1996, the Kadoma Declaration on Community Service Orders in Africa 1997, the Abuja Declaration on Alternatives to Imprisonment 2002 and the Ouagadougou Declaration on Accelerating Prison and Penal Reform in Africa 2002; and mindful that similar measures are needed with respect to the provision of legal aid to prisoners; E/CN.15/2007/L.16/Rev.1 Noting with satisfaction the resolutions passed by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (notably: the Resolution on the Right of Recourse and Fair Trial 1992, the Resolution on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa 1999) and, in particular, the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair Trial and Legal Assistance in Africa 2001; Commending the practical steps that have been taken to implement these standards through the activities of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights and its Special Rapporteur on Prisons and Conditions of Detention; Commending also the Recommendation of the African Regional Preparatory Meeting held at Addis Ababa in March 2004 that the African Region should prepare and present an African Common Position to the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to be held in Bangkok, Thailand in April, 2005, and that the African Union Commission has agreed to prepare and present that Common Position to the Congress; Welcoming the practical measures that have been taken by the governments and legal aid establishments in African countries to apply these standards in their national jurisdictions; while emphasizing that notwithstanding these measures, there are still considerable shortcomings in the provision of legal aid to ordinary people, which are aggravated by shortages of personnel and resources; Noting with satisfaction the growing openness of governments to forging partnerships with non-governmental organizations, civil society, and the international community in developing legal aid programs for ordinary people that will enable increasing numbers of people in Africa, especially in rural areas, to have access to justice; Commending also the recommendations of the African Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Eleventh United Nations Conference for the introduction and strengthening of restorative justice in the criminal justice system; E/CN.15/2007/L.16/Rev.1 The participants of the Conference on Legal Aid in Criminal Justice: the Role of Lawyers, Non-Lawyers and other Service Providers in Africa, held in Lilongwe, Malawi, between 22 and 24 November 2004, hereby declare the importance of: 1. Recognising and supporting the right to legal aid in criminal justice All governments have the primary responsibility to recognise and support basic human rights, including the provision of and access to legal aid for persons in the criminal justice system. As part of this responsibility, governments are encouraged to adopt measures and allocate funding sufficient to ensure an effective and transparent method of delivering legal aid to the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children, and in so doing empower them to access justice. Legal aid should be defined as broadly as possible to include legal advice, assistance, representation, education, and mechanisms for alternative dispute resolution; and to include a wide range of stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, religious and non-religious charitable organizations, professional bodies and associations, and academic institutions. 2. Sensitizing all criminal justice stakeholders Government officials, including police and prison administrators, judges, lawyers, and prosecutors, should be made aware of the crucial role that legal aid plays in the development and maintenance of a just and fair criminal justice system. Since those in control of government criminal justice agencies control access to detainees and to prisoners, they should ensure that the right to legal aid is fully implemented. Government officials are encouraged to allow legal aid to be provided at police stations, in pre-trial detention facilities, in courts, and in prisons. Governments should also sensitize criminal justice system administrators to the societal benefits of providing effective legal aid and the use of alternatives to imprisonment. These benefits include elimination of unnecessary detention, speedy processing of cases, fair and impartial trials, and the reduction of prison populations. E/CN.15/2007/L.16/Rev.1 3. Providing legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process A legal aid program should include legal assistance at all stages of the criminal process including investigation, arrest, pre-trial detention, bail hearings, trials, appeals, and other proceedings brought to ensure that human rights are protected. Suspects, accused persons, and detainees should have access to legal assistance immediately upon arrest and/or detention wherever such arrest and/or detention occurs. A person subject to criminal proceedings should never be prevented from securing legal aid and should always be granted the right to see and consult with a lawyer, accredited para-legal, or legal assistant. Governments should ensure that legal aid programs provide special attention to persons who are detained without charge, or beyond the expiration of their sentences, or who have been held in detention or in prison without access to the courts. Special attention should be given to women and other vulnerable groups, such as children, young people, the elderly, persons with disabilities, persons living with HIV/AIDS, the mentally and seriously ill, refugees, internally displaced persons, and foreign nationals. 4. Recognising the right to redress for violations of human rights Human rights are enforced when government officials know that they will be held accountable for violations of the law and of basic human rights. Persons who are abused or injured by law enforcement officials, or who are not afforded proper recognition of their human rights, should have access to the courts and legal representation to redress their injuries and grievances. Governments should provide legal aid to persons who seek compensation for injuries suffered as the result of misconduct by officials and employees of criminal justice systems. This does not exclude other stakeholders from providing legal aid in such cases. 5. Recognising the role of non-formal means of conflict resolution Traditional and community-based alternatives to formal criminal processes have the potential to resolve disputes without acrimony and to restore social cohesion within the community. These mechanisms also have the potential to reduce reliance upon the police to enforce the law, to reduce congestion in the courts, and E/CN.15/2007/L.16/Rev.1 to reduce the reliance upon incarceration as a means of resolving conflict based upon alleged criminal activity. All stakeholders should recognise the significance of such diversionary measures to the administration of a community-based, victim- oriented criminal justice system and should provide support for such mechanisms provided that they conform to human rights norms. 6. Diversifying legal aid delivery systems Each country has different capabilities and needs when consideration is given to what kind of legal aid systems to employ. In carrying out its responsibility to provide equitable access to justice for poor and vulnerable people, there are a variety of service delivery options that can be considered. These include government funded public defender offices, judicare programmes, justice centres, law clinics - as well as partnerships with civil society and _ faith-based organizations. Whatever options are chosen, they should be structured and funded in a way that preserves their independence and commitment to those populations most in need. Appropriate coordinating mechanisms should be established. 7. Diversifying legal aid service providers It has all too often been observed that there are not enough lawyers in African countries to provide the legal aid services required by the hundreds of thousands of persons who are affected by criminal justice systems. It is also widely recognised that the only feasible way of delivering effective legal aid to the maximum number of persons is to rely on non-lawyers, including law students, para-legals, and legal assistants. These para-legals and legal assistants can provide access to the justice system for persons subjected to it, assist criminal defendants, and provide knowledge and training to those affected by the system that will enable rights to be effectively asserted. An effective legal aid system should employ complementary legal and law-related services by para-legals and legal assistants. 10 8. Encouraging pro-bono provision of legal aid by lawyers It is universally recognised that lawyers are officers of the court and have a duty to see that justice systems operate fairly and equitably. By involving a broad spectrum of the private bar in the provision of legal aid, such services will be recognised as an important duty of the legal profession. The organized bar should provide substantial moral, professional and logistical support to those providing legal aid. Where a bar association, licensing agency, or government has the option of making pro-bono provision of legal aid mandatory, this step should be taken. In countries in which a mandatory pro-bono requirement cannot be imposed, members of the legal profession should be strongly encouraged to provide pro-bono legal aid services. 9. Guaranteeing sustainability of legal aid Legal aid services in many African countries are donor funded and may be terminated at any time. For this reason, there is need for sustainability. Sustainability includes: funding, the provision of professional services, establishment of infrastructure, and the ability to satisfy the needs of the relevant community in the long term. Appropriate government, private sector and other funding, and community ownership arrangements should be established in order to ensure sustainability of legal aid in every country. 10. Encouraging legal literacy Ignorance about the law, human rights, and the criminal justice system is a major problem in many African countries. People who do not know their legal rights are unable to enforce them and are subject to abuse in the criminal justice system. Governments should ensure that human rights education and legal literacy programmes are conducted in educational institutions and in non-formal sectors of society, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, young people, women, and the urban and rural poor. 11 Annex II* Lilongwe Plan of Action The participants recommend the following measures as forming part of a Plan of Action to implement the Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice system in Africa. The document is addressed to governments and criminal justice practitioners, criminologists, academics, development partners as well as non-governmental organizations, community based organizations and faith based groups active in this area. It is meant to be a source of inspiration for concrete actions. LEGAL AID FRAMEWORK Institution building GOVERNMENTS should introduce measures to: Establish a legal aid institution that is independent of government justice departments eg: legal aid board/commission that is accountable to parliament. Diversify legal aid service providers, adopting an inclusive approach, and enter into agreements with the Law Society as well as with university law clinics, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs) and faith-based groups to provide legal aid services. Encourage lawyers to provide pro bono legal aid services as an ethical duty. Establish a legal aid fund to administer public defender schemes, to support university law clinics; and to sponsor clusters of NGOs/CBOs and others to provide legal aid services throughout the country, especially in the rural areas. 12 e Agree minimum quality standards for legal aid services and clarify the role of paralegals and other service providers by: [e) [e) developing standardized training programmes monitoring and evaluating the work of paralegals and other service providers requiring all paralegals operating in the criminal justice system to submit to a code of conduct establishing effective referral mechanisms to lawyers for all these service providers. Public awareness Governments should introduce measures to: Incorporate human rights and ‘Rule of Law’ topics in _ national educational curricula in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations Decade of Human Rights Education. Develop a national media campaign focusing on legal literacy in consultation with civil society organizations and media groups. Sensitise the public and justice agencies on the broadened definition of legal aid and the role all service providers have to play (through TV, radio, the printed media, seminars and workshops). Institute one day a year as ‘Legal Aid Day’ Legislation Governments should: e Enact legislation to promote the right of everyone to basic legal advice, assistance and education, especially for victims of crime and vulnerable groups. Enact legislation to establish an independent national legal aid institution accountable to Parliament and protected from executive interference. Enact legislation to ensure the provision of legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process. 13 Enact legislation to recognize the role of non-lawyers and paralegals and to clarify their duties. Enact legislation to recognize customary law and the role non State justice fora can play in appropriate cases (ie where cases are diverted from the formal criminal justice process) Sustainability Governments should introduce measures to: Diversify the funding-base of legal aid institutions that should be primarily funded by governments, to include endowment funds by donors, companies and communities. Identify fiscal mechanisms for channelling funds to the legal aid fund, such as: o recovering costs in civil legal aid cases where the legal aid litigant has been awarded costs in a matter and channelling such recovered costs into the legal aid fund o taxing any award made in civil legal aid cases and channelling the moneys paid into the legal aid fund o fixing a percentage of the State’s criminal justice budget to be allocated to legal aid services. Identify incentives for lawyers to work in rural areas (eg tax exemptions / reductions). Require all law students to participate in a legal aid clinic or other legal aid community service scheme as part of their professional or national service requirement. Request the Law Society to organize regular circuits of lawyers around the country to provide free legal advice and assistance. Promote partnerships with NGOs, CBOs, faith-based groups and, where appropriate, local councils. 14 LEGAL AID IN ACTION In the police station Governments should introduce measures to: Provide legal and/or paralegal services in police stations in consultation with the Police Service, the Law Society, university law clinics and NGOs. These services might include: [e) providing general advice and assistance at the police station to victims of crime as well as accused persons visiting police cells or lock-ups (cachots) monitoring custody time limits in the police station after which a person must be produced before the court attending at police interview screening juveniles for possible diversion programmes contacting / tracing parents / guardians / sureties assisting with bail from the police station. e Require the police to co-operate with service providers and advertise these services and how to access them in each police station. At court Governments should introduce measures to: Draw up rosters for lawyers to attend court on fixed days in consultation with the Law Society and provide services free of charge. Encourage the judiciary to take a more pro-active role in ensuring the defendant is provided with legal aid and able to put his/her case where the person is unrepresented because of indigency. Promote the wider use of alternative dispute resolution and diversion of criminal cases and encourage the judiciary to consider such options as a first step in all matters. 15 Encourage non-lawyers, paralegals and victim support agencies to provide basic advice and assistance and to conduct regular observations of trial proceedings. Conduct regular case reviews to clear case backlogs, petty cases and refer/divert appropriate cases for mediation; and convene regular meetings of all criminal justice agencies to find local solutions to local problems. In prison Governments should introduce measures to ensure that: Magistrates/judges screen the remand caseload on a regular basis to make sure that people are remanded lawfully, their cases are being expedited, and that they are held appropriately. Prison officers, judicial officers, lawyers, paralegals and non-lawyers conduct periodic census to determine who is in prison and whether they are there as a first rather than a last resort. Custody time limits are enacted. Paralegal services are established in prisons. Services should include: o legal education of prisoners so as to allow them to understand the law, process and apply this learning in their own case o assistance with bail and the identification of potential sureties o assistance with appeals o special assistance to vulnerable groups, especially to women, women with babies, young persons, refugees and foreign nationals, the aged, terminally and mentally ill etc. Access to prisons for responsible NGOs, CBOs and faith-based groups is not subject to unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. In the village Governments should introduce measures to: e Encourage NGOs, CBOs and faith-based groups to train local leaders on the law and constitution and in particular the rights of women and 16 children; and in mediation and other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures. Establish referral mechanisms between the court and village hearings. Such mechanisms might include: o diversion from the court to the village for the offender to make an apology or engage in a victim-offender mediation; o referral from the court to the village to make restitution and/or offer compensation o appeals from the village to the court. Establish a Chief's Council, or similar body of traditional leaders, in order to provide greater consistency in traditional approaches to justice. Record traditional proceedings and provide village hearings (‘courts’) with the tools for documenting proceedings. Provide a voice for women in traditional proceedings. Include customary law in the training of lawyers. In post-conflict societies Governments should introduce measures to: Recruit judges, prosecutors, defence lawyers, police and prison officers in peace- keeping operations and programmes of national reconstruction.
