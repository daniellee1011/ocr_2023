Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Gravely concerned about the extremely difficult socioeconomic conditions being faced by the Palestine refugees in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, as a result of the recurrent military operations, continuing prolonged Israeli closures, the construction of settlements and the wall, evictions, the demolition of homes and livelihood properties causing forced transfers of civilians, and the severe economic and movement restrictions that in

necessary humanitarian assistance and accelerating the reconstruction, rehabilitation and recovery process, Stressing that the situation in the Gaza Strip is unsustainable and that a durable ceasefire
