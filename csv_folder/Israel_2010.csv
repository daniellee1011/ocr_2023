While governmental experts shall establish open lines of communication with the State party under review, the experts shall keep the secretariat abreast of all these communications. 19. Throughout the process, the governmental experts shall appropriately consider the information and material provided by the State party under review through the different means of communication as described in the terms of reference. 20. When seeking additional information and asking for clarification, governmental experts shall bear in mind the non-adversarial, non-intrusive and non- punitive character of the review and the overall goal of assisting the State party under review to reach full implementation of the Convention. 21. Within one month of the receipt of the response to the comprehensive self- assessment checklist and any supplementary information provided by the State party under review, governmental experts shall submit to the secretariat the outcome of the desk review, including requests for clarifications, additional information or supplementary questions, to be translated into the designated languages of the review and provided to the State party under review. 22.

If agreed by the State party under review, the desk review should be complemented by any further means of direct dialogue, such as a country visit or a joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. The country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna shall be planned and organized by the State party under review. While the secretariat will facilitate all practical arrangements, governmental experts shall take all necessary measures from their side to participate in the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, bearing in mind paragraph 29 of the terms of reference. 25. During the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, governmental experts shall uphold the principles and standards outlined in the general guidance above. 26. Governmental experts are expected to actively and constructively participate in all meetings, including at internal debriefings at the end of each working day, or at the end of the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 27. Governmental experts are expected to be respectful and courteous in meetings, respecting time frames set in the programme and allowing time for all members to participate. At the same time, governmental experts are expected to be flexible, as the programme may change during the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 28. Questions should seek to complement information already provided by the State party under review and relate only to the review process. Governmental experts shall therefore remain neutral and not voice personal opinions during the meetings. 29. Governmental experts are expected to take notes during all meetings, which they can refer to for the production of the final country review report. They shall share their opinions and preliminary findings in writing among themselves and with the secretariat within two weeks after the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 30. At the final stage of the country review process and preferably within five months of the beginning of the review, based on the blueprint format, the governmental experts shall, with the assistance of the secretariat, prepare a country review report and send it to the State party under review in the designated language of the review. The report shall identify successes, good practices and challenges and make observations for the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols.

Governmental experts from reviewing States parties shall take a decision on how to divide tasks and issues among themselves, taking into account their respective fields of competence. 18. While governmental experts shall establish open lines of communication with the State party under review, the experts shall keep the secretariat abreast of all these communications. 19. Throughout the process, the governmental experts shall appropriately consider the information and material provided by the State party under review through the different means of communication as described in the terms of reference. 20.

The country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna shall be planned and organized by the State party under review. While the secretariat will facilitate all practical arrangements, governmental experts shall take all necessary measures from their side to participate in the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, bearing in mind paragraph 29 of the terms of reference. 25.
