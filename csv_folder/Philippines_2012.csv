Furthermore, article 14, paragraph 3(d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that everyone should be entitled, among other rights, “to be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it”. 3. A functioning legal aid system, as part of a functioning criminal justice system, may reduce the length of time suspects are held in police stations and detention centres, in addition to reducing the prison population, wrongful convictions, prison overcrowding and congestion in the courts, and reducing reoffending and revictimization. It may also protect and safeguard the rights of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process. Legal aid can be utilized to contribute to the prevention of crime by increasing awareness of the law. 4. Legal aid plays an important role in facilitating diversion and the use of community-based sanctions and measures, including non-custodial measures; promoting greater community involvement in the criminal justice system; reducing the unnecessary use of detention and imprisonment; rationalizing criminal justice policies; and ensuring efficient use of State resources. 5. Regrettably, many countries still lack the necessary resources and capacity to provide legal aid for suspects, those charged with a criminal offence, prisoners, victims and witnesses. 6. The United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, which are drawn from international standards and recognized good practices, aim to provide guidance to States on the fundamental principles on which a legal aid system in criminal justice should be based and to outline the specific elements required for an effective and sustainable national legal aid system, in order to strengthen access to legal aid pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 2007/24, entitled “International cooperation for the improvement of access to legal aid in criminal justice systems, particularly in Africa”. V.12-52823 7. In line with the Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice System in Africa and the Lilongwe Plan of Action for the implementation of the Declaration, the Principles and Guidelines follow a broad concept of legal aid. 8. For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the term “legal aid” includes legal advice, assistance and representation for persons detained, arrested or imprisoned, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence and for victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process that is provided at no cost for those without sufficient means or when the interests of justice so require. Furthermore, “legal aid” is intended to include the concepts of legal education, access to legal information and other services provided for persons through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and restorative justice processes. 9. For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the individual who provides legal aid is herein referred to as the “legal aid provider”, and the organizations that provide legal aid are referred to as the “legal aid service providers”. The first providers of legal aid are lawyers, but the Principles and Guidelines also suggest that States involve a wide range of stakeholders as legal aid service providers in the form of non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, religious and non-religious charitable organizations, professional bodies and associations and academia. Provision of legal aid to foreign nationals should conform to the requirements of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other applicable bilateral treaties. 10. It should be noted that States employ different models for the provision of legal aid. These may involve public defenders, private lawyers, contract lawyers, pro bono schemes, bar associations, paralegals and others. The Principles and Guidelines do not endorse any specific model but encourage States to guarantee the basic right to legal aid of persons detained, arrested@ or imprisoned, suspected® or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence, while expanding legal aid to include others who come into contact with the criminal justice system and diversifying legal aid delivery schemes. 11. The Principles and Guidelines are based on the recognition that States should, where appropriate, undertake a series of measures that, even if not strictly related to legal aid, can maximize the positive impact that the establishment and/or reinforcement of a properly working legal aid system may have on a properly functioning criminal justice system and on access to justice. 12. Recognizing that certain groups are entitled to additional protection or are more vulnerable when involved with the criminal justice system, the Principles and Guidelines also provide specific provisions for women, children and groups with special needs. 13. The Principles and Guidelines are primarily concerned with the right to legal aid, as distinct from the right to legal assistance as recognized in international law. a The term “arrest”, “detained person” and “imprisoned person” are understood as defined in the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (General Assembly resolution 43/173, annex). b The right to legal aid of suspects arises before questioning, when they become aware that they are the subject of investigation, and when they are under threat of abuse and intimidation, e.g. in custodial settings. V.12-52823 Nothing in these Principles and Guidelines should be interpreted as providing a lesser degree of protection than that provided under existing national laws and regulations and international and regional human rights conventions or covenants applicable to the administration of justice, including, but not limited to, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. However, this should not be interpreted as meaning that States are bound by international and regional instruments that they have not ratified or acceded to. B. Principles Principle 1. Right to legal aid 14. Recognizing that legal aid is an essential element of a functioning criminal justice system that is based on the rule of law, a foundation for the enjoyment of other rights, including the right to a fair trial, and an important safeguard that ensures fundamental fairness and public trust in the criminal justice process,° States should guarantee the right to legal aid in their national legal systems at the highest possible level, including, where applicable, in the constitution. Principle 2. Responsibilities of the State 15. States should consider the provision of legal aid as their duty and responsibility. To that end, they should consider, where appropriate, enacting specific legislation and regulations and ensure that a comprehensive legal aid system is in place that is accessible, effective, sustainable and credible. States should allocate the necessary human and financial resources to the legal aid system. 16. The State should not interfere with the organization of the defence of the beneficiary of legal aid or with the independence of his or her legal aid provider. 17. States should enhance knowledge of the people about their rights and obligations under law through appropriate means, in order to prevent criminal conduct and victimization. 18. States should endeavour to enhance the knowledge of their communities about their justice system and its functions, the ways to file complaints before the courts and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. 19. States should consider adopting appropriate measures for informing their community about acts criminalized under the law. The provision of such information for those travelling to other jurisdictions, where crimes are categorized and prosecuted differently, is essential for crime prevention. ¢ The term “justice process” is understood as defined in the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/20, annex). For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the term shall also encompass extradition, transfer of prisoners and mutual legal assistance proceedings. V.12-52823 Principle 3. Legal aid for persons suspected of or charged with a criminal offence 20. States should ensure that anyone who is arrested, detained, suspected of or charged with a criminal offence punishable by a term of imprisonment or the death penalty is entitled to legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process. 21. Legal aid should also be provided, regardless of the person’s means, if the interests of justice so require, for example, given the urgency or complexity of the case or the severity of the potential penalty. 22. Children should have access to legal aid under the same conditions or more lenient conditions as adults. 23. It is the responsibility of police, prosecutors and judges to ensure that those who appear before them who cannot afford a lawyer and/or who are vulnerable are provided access to legal aid. Principle 4. Legal aid for victims of crime 24. Without prejudice to or inconsistency with the rights of the accused, States should, where appropriate, provide legal aid to victims of crime. Principle 5. Legal aid for witnesses 25. Without prejudice to or inconsistency with the rights of the accused, States should, where appropriate, provide legal aid to witnesses of crime. Principle 6. Non-discrimination 26. States should ensure the provision of legal aid to all persons regardless of age, race, colour, gender, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin or property, citizenship or domicile, birth, education or social status or other status. Principle 7. Prompt and effective provision of legal aid 27. States should ensure that effective legal aid is provided promptly at all stages of the criminal justice process. 28. Effective legal aid includes, but is not limited to, unhindered access to legal aid providers for detained persons, confidentiality of communications, access to case files and adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence. Principle 8. Right to be informed 29. States should ensure that, prior to any questioning and at the time of deprivation of liberty, persons are informed of their right to legal aid and other procedural safeguards as well as of the potential consequences of voluntarily waiving those rights. 30. States should ensure that information on rights during the criminal justice process and on legal aid services is made freely available and is accessible to the public. V.12-52823 Principle 9. Remedies and safeguards 31. States should establish effective remedies and safeguards that apply if access to legal aid is undermined, delayed or denied or if persons have not been adequately informed of their right to legal aid. Principle 10. Equity in access to legal aid 32. Special measures should be taken to ensure meaningful access to legal aid for women, children and groups with special needs, including, but not limited to, the elderly, minorities, persons with disabilities, persons with mental illnesses, persons living with HIV and other serious contagious diseases, drug users, indigenous and aboriginal people, stateless persons, asylum-seekers, foreign citizens, migrants and migrant workers, refugees and internally displaced persons. Such measures should address the special needs of these groups, including gender-sensitive and age-appropriate measures. 33. States should also ensure that legal aid is provided to persons living in rural, remote and economically and socially disadvantaged areas and to persons who are members of economically and socially disadvantaged groups. Principle 11. Legal aid in the best interests of the child 34. In all legal aid decisions affecting children,‘ the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration. 35. Legal aid provided to children should be prioritized, in the best interests of the child, and be accessible, age-appropriate, multidisciplinary, effective and responsive to the specific legal and social needs of children. Principle 12. Independence and protection of legal aid providers 36. States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to carry out their work effectively, freely and independently. In particular, States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; are able to travel, to consult and meet with their clients freely and in full confidentiality both within their own country and abroad, and to freely access prosecution and other relevant files; and do not suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics. Principle 13. Competence and accountability of legal aid providers 37. States should put in place mechanisms to ensure that all legal aid providers possess education, training, skills and experience that are commensurate with the nature of their work, including the gravity of the offences dealt with, and the rights and needs of women, children and groups with special needs. 4 “Child” shall mean any person under 18 years of age, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. V.12-52823 38. Disciplinary complaints against legal aid providers should be promptly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with professional codes of ethics before an impartial body and subject to judicial review. Principle 14. Partnerships 39. States should recognize and encourage the contribution of lawyers’ associations, universities, civil society and other groups and institutions in providing legal aid. 40. Where appropriate, public-private and other forms of partnerships should be established to extend the reach of legal aid. C. Guidelines Guideline 1. Provision of legal aid 41. Whenever States apply a means test to determine eligibility for legal aid, they should ensure that: (a) Persons whose means exceed the limits of the means test but who cannot afford, or do not have access to, a lawyer in situations where legal aid would have otherwise been granted and where it is in the interests of justice to provide such aid, are not excluded from receiving assistance; (b) The criteria for applying the means test are widely publicized; (c) Persons urgently requiring legal aid at police stations, detention centres or courts should be provided preliminary legal aid while their eligibility is being determined.

This generally implies that no information or personal data may be made available or published, particularly in the media, that could reveal or indirectly enable the disclosure of the 15 child’s identity, including images of the child, detailed descriptions of the child or the child’s family, names or addresses of the child’s family members and audio and video records. Guideline 11. Nationwide legal aid system 55. In order to encourage the functioning of a nationwide legal aid system, States should, where it is appropriate, undertake measures: (a) To ensure and promote the provision of effective legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process for persons detained, arrested or imprisoned, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence and for victims of crime; (b) To provide legal aid to persons who have been unlawfully arrested or detained or who have received a final judgement of the court as a result of a miscarriage of justice, in order to enforce their right to retrial, reparation, including compensation, rehabilitation and guarantees of non-repetition; (c) To promote coordination between justice agencies and _ other professionals such as health, social services and victim support workers in order to maximize effectiveness of the legal aid system, without prejudice to the rights of the accused; (d) To establish partnerships with bar or legal associations to ensure the provision of legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process; (e) To enable paralegals to provide those forms of legal aid allowed by national law or practice to persons arrested, detained, suspected of or charged with a criminal offence, in particular in police stations or other detention centres; (f) To promote the provision of appropriate legal aid for the purpose of crime prevention. 56.

To ensure the effective implementation of nationwide legal aid schemes, States should consider establishing a legal aid body or authority to provide, administer, coordinate and monitor legal aid services. Such a body should: (a) Be free from undue political or judicial interference, be independent of the Government in decision-making related to legal aid and should not be subject to the direction or control or financial intimidation of any person or authority in the performance of its functions, regardless of its administrative structure; f “Child-friendly legal aid” is the provision of legal assistance to children in criminal, civil and administrative proceedings that is accessible, age-appropriate, multidisciplinary and effective, and that is responsive to the range of legal and social needs faced by children and youth. Child-friendly legal aid is delivered by lawyers and non-lawyers who are trained in children’s law and child and adolescent development and who are able to communicate effectively with children and their caretakers. 17 (b) Have the necessary powers to provide legal aid, including but not limited to the appointment of personnel; the designation of legal aid services to individuals; the setting of criteria and accreditation of legal aid providers, including training requirements; the oversight of legal aid providers and the establishment of independent bodies to handle complaints against them; and the assessment of legal aid needs nationwide; and the power to develop its own budget; (c) Develop, in consultation with key justice sector stakeholders and civil society organizations, a long-term strategy guiding the evolution and sustainability of legal aid; (d) Report periodically to the responsible authority.

Guideline 15. Regulation and oversight of legal aid providers 69. In adherence with principle 12, and subject to existing national legislation ensuring transparency and accountability, States in cooperation with professional associations, should: (a) Ensure that criteria are set for the accreditation of legal aid providers; 19 (b) Ensure legal aid providers are subject to applicable professional codes of conduct, with appropriate sanctions for infractions; (c) Establish rules to ensure that legal aid providers are not allowed to request any payment from the beneficiaries of legal aid, except when authorized to do so; (d) Ensure that disciplinary complaints against legal aid providers are reviewed by impartial bodies; (ec) Establish appropriate oversight mechanisms for legal aid providers, in particular with a view to preventing corruption. Guideline 16. Partnerships with non-State legal aid service providers and universities 70. States should, where appropriate, engage in partnerships with non-State legal aid service providers, including non-governmental organizations and other service providers. 71.

States should, where appropriate, also take measures: (a) To encourage and support the establishment of legal aid clinics in law departments within universities to promote clinical and public interest law programmes among faculty members and the student body, including in the accredited curriculum of universities; (b) To encourage and provide incentives to law students to participate, under proper supervision and in accordance with national law or practice, in a legal aid clinic or other legal aid community scheme, as part of their academic curriculum or professional development; 20 (c) To develop, where they do not already exist, student practice rules that allow students to practice in the courts under the supervision of qualified lawyers or faculty staff, provided such rules are developed in consultation with and accepted by the competent courts or bodies that regulate the practice of law before the courts; (d) In jurisdictions requiring law students to undertake legal internships, develop rules for them to be allowed to practice in the courts under the supervision of qualified lawyers. Guideline 17. Research and data 73. States should ensure that mechanisms to track, monitor and evaluate legal aid are established and should continually strive to improve the provision of legal aid. 74. For this purpose, States could introduce measures: (a) To conduct regular research and data collection disaggregated by gender, age, socio-economic status and geographical distribution of legal aid recipients and to publish the findings of such research; (b) To share good practices in the provision of legal aid; (c) To monitor the efficient and effective delivery of legal aid in accordance with international human rights standards; (d) To provide cross-cultural, culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive and age-appropriate training to legal aid providers; (ec) To improve communication, coordination and cooperation between all justice agencies, especially at the local level, to identify local problems and to agree on solutions to improve the provision of legal aid.

efforts against trafficking in persons lack the gender and age sensitivity needed to address effectively the situation of women and girls, who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour, services and other forms of exploitation, thus highlighting the need to incorporate a gender- and age-sensitive approach in all anti-trafficking efforts, Recognizing also the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, in particular girls, Recognizing further that poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination and marginalization are some of the contributing factors that make persons vulnerable to trafficking, Recognizing the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of being trafficked and to help to identify victims of trafficking in persons, Recognizing also that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt adequate legislation and programmes to implement it and to continue improving the collection of reliable sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls, Recognizing further the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts to protect women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse, Concerned about the use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for purposes of

children, A/C.3/67/L.20/Rev.1 Concerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Noting that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by trafficking in persons in some parts of the world, Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, on account of their gender, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness, Encouraging the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-seventh session to consider the issue of trafficking in women and girls within the framework of the priority theme for 2013, “Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls”, Reaffirming the importance of bilateral, subregional, regional and international cooperation mechanisms and initiatives, including information exchanges on best practices, of Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Reaffirming also that global efforts, including international cooperation and technical assistance programmes, to eradicate trafficking in persons, especially women and children, demand the strong political commitment, coordinated and coherent efforts and the active cooperation of all Governments of countries of origin, transit and destination, Recognizing that policies and programmes for prevention, protection, rehabilitation, repatriation and reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, transit and destination, Convinced of

addressing the socioeconomic needs of their families and communities, Reaffirming the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, Affirming that ensuring and promoting the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, without distinction, is critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, Recalling its resolution 66/124 of 19 December 2011, by which it decided to convene a one-day high-level meeting of the General Assembly, on 23 September 2013, with the overarching theme “The way forward: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond”, which shall be funded within existing resources, in order to strengthen efforts to ensure accessibility for and the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development

society, and reaffirming that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person, Recalling that early diagnosis, appropriate research and effective interventions are vital to the growth and development of the individual, and emphasizing that early intervention is crucial for addressing the needs of the

Assembly, ® Recognizing that a major barrier to improving the health and well-being of children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities and their families is the paucity of knowledge and expertise to recognize symptoms and identify ASD, and also recognizing that the absence of effective routine screening that allows for early detection, in turn, limits access to care and early interventions and that, without research to develop and implement effective programmes, the emergence of appropriate solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families does not occur, Acknowledging efforts to increase awareness of the rights of those affected by ASD, DD and associated disabilities, including the commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day, which led to
