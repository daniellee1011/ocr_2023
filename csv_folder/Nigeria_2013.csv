Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from hunger-related illness, that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 842 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hunger and that an additional 1 billion people are suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries; 5. | Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and that the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries; 6. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8. | Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 9.

Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security, and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 15. Also recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 16. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa;9 17. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity!° and to consider becoming parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture!! as a matter of priority; 18.

Takes note with appreciation of the growing movement, in different regions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and measures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all; 23.

Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty, as well as non-communicable diseases; 27.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 29. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 30. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 31. Also stresses that States parties to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights should consider implementing that agreement in a manner that is supportive of food security, while being mindful of the obligation of Member States to promote and protect the right to food; 32. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently occurring across different regions, and expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to cut operations across different regions, including Southern Africa; 33. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to continue to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 34. Takes note with appreciation of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur; !3 35.

B. 2/13 further recalling the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective across the United Nations system in relation to the girl child, Recalling the Secretary-General’s 2008-2015 campaign “UNiTE to End Violence against Women” and the call upon Governments, civil society, women’s organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire United Nations system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls, Taking note of the appointment by the Secretary-General of the first Envoy on Youth in line with the imperative, contained in his five-year action agenda, on “Working for and with women and young people”, Recognizing that chronic poverty remains one of the biggest obstacles to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children, including the girl child, Recognizing also that urgent national and international action is required to eliminate poverty, in particular extreme poverty, and noting that the ongoing effects of the global financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those headed by girls, Recognizing further that the phenomenon of child-headed households is linked to other economic, social and political realities, such as armed conflict, natural disasters, lack of economic empowerment and health inequities, and that a comprehensive approach to these problems is needed to resolve the issue of child- headed households, Deeply concerned about the serious social problem of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, and that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, the erosion of the extended family, the exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase in the number of child- headed households, Recognizing that child-headed households may result from the death of parents and/or legal guardians, and that children can become de facto heads of households owing to parental illness, whether physical or mental, parental neglect, the migration of parents or other such factors, Deeply concerned about the extreme vulnerability of children who are heads of households, particularly girls, who may be exceptionally negatively affected by the economic and care burdens placed on them at a young age, which in turn may lead to their having difficulty completing their education and increase their vulnerability to poverty, discrimination, trafficking and physical abuse, Deeply concerned also about the vulnerability of children, in particular the girl child, raised in child-headed households, who suffer from the lack of adult support and may be particularly vulnerable to poverty, mental and psychosocial trauma and physical vulnerability owing to, inter alia, food insecurity and poor nutrition, limited access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and communicable and non-communicable diseases, Deeply concerned further that children heading households may be subjected to stigma and discrimination owing to the fact that parental death is a result of 3/13 HIV/AIDS, and that children heading households may be at greater risk of HIV because of their vulnerability to violence and exploitation as they seek to support their households, Deeply concerned that, in situations of poverty, armed conflict, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies, the incidence of child-headed households increases and makes girl children particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, abuse, exploitation and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that an estimated 68 million girls?° are engaged in child labour and that many of them face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with domestic chores, which deprive them of their childhood and diminish their opportunities to benefit from education and decent employment in the future, Recognizing that the needs of girls vary, according to a number of factors, including their age, and that the risks of violence and discrimination that they face change over their life cycles, from childhood through adolescence, Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing further that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child, early and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the 20 International Labour Organization, Making progress against child labour — Global estimates and trends 2000-2012 (Geneva, 2013). 4/13 corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls is underrecognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded as a result of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Taking note with appreciation of the adoption by the Human Rights Council of its resolution 24/23 of 27 September 2013 entitled “Strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage: challenges, achievements, best practices and implementation gaps”, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and child birth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their employment opportunities and their and their children’s quality of life and violates and impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation in the next generation, as reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/146 of 20 December 2012, remains unfinished business, Stressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources and technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs and priorities of child-headed households and women and girls at risk of or subjected to child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, 5/13 Emphasizing that increased access to education for young people, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination, including in respect of their access to education, health- care services and employment, and the importance of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this regard, 1. Stresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of the girl child as provided to her under human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,’ the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,’ the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? and the Optional Protocols thereto‘ as a matter of priority; 2. Urges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)?! and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)?2 of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 3. Urges all Governments and the United Nations system to strengthen efforts bilaterally and with international organizations and private sector donors in order to achieve the goals of the World Education Forum?? and to implement the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative, and calls for the reaffirmation and implementation of the commitments contained in the Education for All goals and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to gender and education; 4. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education, including communications and technology education, where available, for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive formal education, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurial training for young women and to tackle male and female stereotypes in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment, equitable compensation and decent work; 5. Calls upon States and the international community to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children and ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, improving the safety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring all schools are accessible, safe, secure and free from violence, and providing separate and adequate sanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families and children who become heads of households; 23 See United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Final Report of the World Education Forum, Dakar, Senegal, 26-28 April 2000 (Paris, 2000). 6/13 6.

Urges States to strengthen efforts to urgently eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and, where applicable, to remain dedicated to the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto;?4 10. Also urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, in particular extreme poverty, deprived of nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-care services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, while a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is particularly threatening and harmful to the girl child, leaving her unable to enjoy her rights, to reach her full potential and to participate as a full member of society, with a particular focus on children living in child-headed households, including the child head of household; 11. Further urges States to ensure that the applicable requirements of the International Labour Organization for the employment of girls and boys are respected and effectively enforced and that girls who are employed have equal access to decent work, and equal payment and remuneration, are protected from economic and sexual exploitation, discrimination, sexual harassment, violence and abuse in the workplace, are aware of their rights and have access to formal and non-formal education, skills development and vocational training, and also urges States to develop gender-sensitive measures, including national action plans, where appropriate, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, commercial sexual exploitation, hazardous forms of child labour, trafficking and slavery-like practices, including forced and bonded labour, and to recognize that girls, including in child- headed households, face greater risks in this regard; 7/13 12.

Calls upon States to strengthen the capacity of national health systems, and in this regard calls upon the international community to assist national efforts, including by allocating adequate resources in order to provide essential services needed to prevent obstetric fistula and to treat those cases that occur by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care, to adolescent girls, including those living in poverty and in underserved rural areas where obstetric fistula is most common; 15. Urges all States to enact and strictly enforce laws ending child, early and forced marriage and ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses, to enact and strictly enforce laws concerning the minimum legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage, to raise the minimum age for marriage, engage all stakeholders, where necessary, and ensure that these laws to end child, early and forced marriage are well known, to further develop and implement comprehensive policies, plans of action and programmes for the survival, protection, development and advancement of the girl child in order to promote and protect the full enjoyment of her human rights, and to ensure equal opportunities for girls, including by making such plans an integral part of her total development process; 16. Calls upon States to support and implement, including with dedicated resources, multisectoral policies and programmes that end the practice of child, early and forced marriage and ensure the provision of viable alternatives and institutional support, especially educational opportunities for girls, with an emphasis on keeping girls in school through post-primary education, including those who are already married or pregnant, ensuring physical access to education, including by increasing financial incentives to families, promoting the empowerment of girls, improving educational quality, ensuring safe and hygienic conditions in schools, and, where applicable, establishing safe residential facilities; 17. Urges States to ensure that the rights of children in child-headed households are respected and that the heads of such households have full enjoyment of all the rights of the child, and to further ensure that children in child-headed households, particularly girls, receive the support they need to ensure their continued attendance in school consistent with their age; 8/13 18. Also urges States to ensure that efforts to enact and implement legislation to protect, support and empower child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, include provisions to ensure their economic well-being, access to health-care services, nutrition, clean water and sanitation, shelter and education, and inheritance, and that the family is protected and assisted in staying together; 19. Calls upon States to put in place concrete measures to ensure that while children heading households, especially girls, exercise all the rights of the child, they also receive appropriate assistance to enable them to fulfil their de facto responsibilities as household heads by ensuring and protecting their property and inheritance rights; 20.

Also calls upon States to strengthen research, data collection and analysis on the girl child, disaggregated by household structure, sex, age, disability status, economic situation and marital status and geographical location, in order to provide a better understanding of the situations of girls, especially of the multiple forms of discrimination that they face, and to inform the development of necessary policies and programme responses, which should take a holistic age-appropriate approach to addressing the full range of the forms of discrimination that girls may face, in order to protect their rights effectively; 24. Urges States to take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment by girls with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, to adopt, implement and strengthen appropriate policies and programmes designed to address their needs, and to take into account the conclusions contained in the outcome document adopted at the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities, held on 23 September 2013; 25 25.

Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, Reiterating concern about the seriousness of problems and threats posed by corruption to the stability and security of societies, undermining the institutions and values of democracy, ethical values and justice and jeopardizing sustainable development and the rule of law, Recalling that asset recovery is an integral part of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and bearing in mind that chapter V of the Convention is critical to the successful implementation of the Convention, Recalling also article 51 of the Convention on making return of illicit assets to the countries of origin a fundamental principle of the Convention and obligating States parties to afford one another the widest measure of cooperation and assistance in that regard, Recalling further its resolution 1/4 of 14 December 2006 setting up the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on Asset Recovery, Reaffirming the commitment of Member States as encapsulated in chapter V of the Convention to prevent, detect and deter in a more effective manner the international transfer of proceeds of crime and to strengthen international cooperation in assets recovery, Stressing the critical importance of mobilizing political will for the effective implementation of chapter V of the Convention, Please reeyele & CAC/COSP/2013/L.10 Recognizing that States parties continue to face challenges in the recovery of assets owing inter alia to differences in legal systems, the complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with mutual legal assistance procedures of other States parties and difficulties in identifying the flow of proceeds of corruption, Noting in particular that a large proportion of the proceeds of corruption, including those emanating from foreign bribery-related cases, have yet to be returned to the countries of origin, Concerned about the difficulties, particularly the practical difficulties, both requested and requesting States face in asset recovery, taking into account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable development, Noting the difficulties of providing information establishing a link between proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in the requesting State, particularly the difficulty of proving such connections, Recalling article 56 of the Convention, which enjoins States parties to furnish, without prejudice to their own investigations, prosecutions and judicial proceedings, information on proceeds of offences to another State party without prior request, when the disclosure of such information might assist the receiving State party in initiating, or carrying out investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings, or might lead to a request by that State party, Acknowledging the right of the requested State party under article 57, paragraph 4, of the Convention to deduct, where appropriate, reasonable expenses incurred in investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings leading to the return of confiscated property, but noting with concern that the huge cost of recovery of assets in some jurisdictions has made the recovery of assets difficult and, accordingly, has led to the abandonment of some cases seeking the return of proceeds of crime to the countries of origin, Noting the emerging trend of the use of settlements and compromise to conclude foreign bribery-related cases, but observing that the new mechanism which has enhanced enforcement actions in some corruption cases worldwide appears to be hindering the process of international cooperation and asset recovery and thereby rendering the implementation of chapter V of the Convention vulnerable, Noting with concern that States parties are concluding settlements in bribery cases without reference to or the involvement of the jurisdictions where foreign officials were bribed, and noting with concern also the narrow interpretation of “proceeds of crime” to exclude, for example, disgorgement of profits and criminal fines, to prevent such proceeds from being returned to victim States, by so doing using settlements to create an artificial category of victims of corruption, thereby reducing the potency of chapter V of the Convention, Calling upon all States parties, in particular requested and requesting States, to act cooperatively to recover the proceeds of corruption and demonstrate strong commitment to ensuring the return of those proceeds to the countries of origin, Considering the vital importance of a proactive approach in asset recovery investigations to identify, trace, freeze and seize stolen assets hidden by the use of V.13-87971 CAC/COSP/2013/L.10 highly complex mechanisms, such as front companies, and recognizing that the spontaneous exchange of information between requesting and requested States, outside of formal requests for mutual legal assistance, must be strengthened and regarded as good practice for contributing effectively to the recovery of the proceeds of corruption, within a reasonable deadline, in compliance with chapter V of the Convention, Welcoming the Swiss initiative on best practices for efficient asset recovery undertaken with a view to elaborating internationally coherent and coordinated approaches to asset recovery cases for practitioners from requesting and requested States, implemented in close collaboration with the International Centre for Asset Recovery and with the support of the World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, 1. Urges Member States to take a proactive approach to international cooperation in assets recovery by making full use of the provisions of chapter V of the Convention, including by initiating requests for assistance, making spontaneous disclosures of information on the proceeds of offences to other States parties and considering making requests for notifications in accordance with article 52, paragraph 2 (b), of the Convention, and, where appropriate, implementing measures to permit the recognition of non-conviction-based forfeiture judgements; 2. Encourages States parties to compile and provide information in accordance with article 52 of the Convention and to undertake actions that help to establish linkage between assets and offences under the Convention; 3. Calls upon States parties to afford one another the widest possible cooperation and assistance in the identification, tracing, freezing or seizure of assets derived from corruption and in the return of such assets, and to give particular and timely consideration to the execution of requests; 4.
