an increasing economic cost for Governments, also threatens the national security and sovereignty of States, as well as the dignity and hope of millions of people and their families, and causes irreparable loss of human lives, Concerned that demand for, production of and trafficking in illicit drugs and psychotropic substances continue to seriously threaten the socio-economic and political systems, stability, national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States, especially those involved in conflicts and wars, and that trafficking in drugs could make conflict resolution more difficult, Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug-trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money-laundering and illicit traffic in arms, precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing the need for international cooperation and implementation of effective strategies on the basis of the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, which are essential to achieving results against all forms of transnational criminal activities, Deeply convinced that the special session made a significant contribution to a new comprehensive framework for international cooperation, based on an integrated and balanced approach with strategies, measures, methods, practical activities, goals and specific targets to be met, that all States, the United Nations system and other international organizations

world drug problem in their programmes, taking into account the priorities of States, Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, can make an effective contribution to and should play an active role in addressing the world drug problem, Emphasizing the importance of the adoption of the Action Plan for the Implementation ofthe Declaration on the Guiding Principles of

use of drugs and at reducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse, ensuring that special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, particularly youth, and constitutes one of the pillars of the new global strategy and an important initiative of the United Nations Decade against Drug Abuse, 1991-2000, and reaffirming the need for demand reduction programmes, Emphasizing equally the importance of

produce narcotic drugs for scientific and medical purposes, and of the International Narcotics Control Board in preventing the diversion of such substances toillicit markets and in maintaining production at a level consistent with licit demand, in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971,° Acknowledging that there are links, under certain circumstances, between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production, Stressing that respect for all human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem, Ensuring that women and men benefit equally, and without any discrimination, from strategies directed against the world drug problem, through their involvement in all stages of programmes and policy-making, Recognizing that the use of the Internet poses new opportunities and challenges to international cooperation in combating drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking, and further recognizing the need for increased cooperation among States and the exchange of information, including with reference to national experiences, on how to counteract the promotion of drug abuse and the illicit drug trafficking through this instrument and on ways to use the Internet for information concerning drug demand reduction, I Respect for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and international law in the fight against the world drug problem 1.

Organizations of the United Nations system,? other international organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations are invited to provide support to Member States in implementing the Action Plan, according to their available resources, specific mandates and the different roles that they are to play in achieving the goals set out in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction. 3. The Action Plan reflects the emphasis in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction on the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach involving demand reduction and supply reduction, each reinforcing the other, together with the appropriate application of the principle of shared responsibility. It stresses the need for services responsible for prevention, including law enforcement agencies, to transmit the same message and use similar language. 4. The Action Plan is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.?! It allows for flexible approaches to reflect social, cultural, religious and political differences, and it acknowledges that efforts to reduce illicit drug demand are at different levels of implementation in different countries. 5.

Such programmes should be integrated to promote cooperation between all concerned, should include a wide variety of appropriate interventions, should promote health and social well-being among individuals, families and communities, and should reduce the adverse consequences of drug abuse for the individual and for society as a whole. 6.
