Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming the importance of the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,

an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan

insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension and that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to food is threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major factors, such as the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, A/HRC/31/L.14 desertification and the impact of global climate change, as well as

Also recognizes the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, inter alia, traditional seed supply systems, including for many indigenous peoples and local communities; 16. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; A/HRC/31/L.14 17.

Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate small- scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches; 20. Recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 21.

States to exercise due diligence to prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators of trafficking in persons and to protect and empower victims, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims, Seriously concerned that an increasing number of women and girls are being trafficked, including to developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States, and recognizing that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects women and girls and that men and boys are also victims of trafficking, including for sexual exploitation, Recognizing that certain efforts against trafficking in persons lack the gender and age sensitivity needed to effectively differentiate between and respond to the risks faced by women and girls, who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced marriage, forced labour, services and other forms of exploitation, thus highlighting the need to incorporate a gender- and age-sensitive approach into all anti-trafficking efforts, Recognizing also the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, in particular girls, Recognizing further that pervasive gender inequality, poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination and marginalization and persistent demand for trafficked women and girls are among the underlying causes that make women and girls vulnerable to trafficking, Recognizing the need to adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand, which fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to trafficking, Recognizing also the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations, including in conflict and post-conflict environments, natural disasters and other emergency environments, as well as the devastating consequences for women and girls in such circumstances, and noting in this regard the Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiative and the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change resulting from the Nansen Initiative, while recognizing that not all States are participating in them, Recognizing further the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of being trafficked and to help to identify victims of trafficking in persons, Recognizing that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls and to protecting and assisting the victims of human trafficking remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt and implement adequate legislation and other measures and to continue improving the 4/13 collection of reliable data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant factors and of statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls, Recognizing also that further work is required both to better understand the link between migration and trafficking in persons and to develop more effective responses to eliminate the risk of trafficking in the migration process in order to, inter alia, further efforts to protect women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse, Concerned about the use of new information and communications technologies, including the Internet, for purposes of recruiting for the exploitation of the prostitution of others, including for exploiting women and children and for child pornography, including sexual abuse material, paedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse of children, as well as for forced marriage and forced labour, while acknowledging the role that information and communications technologies play in reducing the risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, including by empowering women and children to report such abuses, Concerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of national laws and international standards, Noting with concern that women and girls are also vulnerable to the risk of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and in this regard taking note of Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 25/1, entitled “Preventing and combating trafficking in human organs and trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal”,’” adopted by the Commission at its twenty-fifth session, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Noting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, exploitative labour and the illegal removal of organs is met by trafficking in persons, and recognizing that human trafficking is fuelled by high profits for traffickers and demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, owing to pervasive and persistent gender inequality, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of the violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness, See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2016, Supplement No. 10

Resolution 70/1. 2/7 Noting with concern that poverty, insecurity and lack of education are among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Noting with concern also that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and also that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, as well as their meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that raising awareness of the harmful consequences of child, early and forced marriage, including among men and boys, can contribute to promoting social norms that support efforts by girls and their families to end this harmful practice, Recognizing further men and boys as strategic partners and allies and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and recognizing that educational opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced 3/7 displacement, armed conflict and natural disaster and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, 1.
