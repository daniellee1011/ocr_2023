safeguards, effective oversight and remedies, with a view to further practical guidance, grounded in international human rights law, on the principles of necessity, proportionality and legitimacy, Noting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, “NETmundial”, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 23 and 24 April 2014, taking note of the outcome of that meeting, which reiterated, inter alia, the need for human rights to underpin Internet governance and that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, and recognizing that effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology will require an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Noting also that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communication technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Reaffirming the human right to

data, and highlighting the need to further consider the linkages between mass surveillance and its effects on other human rights, 6 A/69/397. 7 A/HRC/23/40 and Corr.1. 2/4 Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, including data about communications, known as metadata, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, especially when undertaken on a mass scale, Noting that while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory and that any interference with the right to privacy must be necessary and proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims and not impair the essence of the right, Noting that surveillance, the interception of digital communications and/or the collection of personal data that involves a State’s exercise of power or effective control over communications infrastructure, regardless of its location, may engage its human rights obligations relating to the right to privacy, Emphasizing that the human rights obligations of a State regarding the right to privacy extend to the exercise of its regulatory jurisdiction over private parties that physically control data, regardless of their location, Recalling that private enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights and to prevent and address the adverse impacts of their activities on human rights, as set out, notably, in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, ® Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception

fisheries enforcement activities, Concerned that marine pollution from all sources constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, owing to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary, including identification of such sources, Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, Reaffirming the importance of sustainable aquaculture to food security, and concerned about the potential effects of genetically engineered aquatic fish species on the health and sustainability of wild fish stocks, Calling attention to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities whose livelihoods, economic development and food security are heavily dependent on sustainable fisheries and will suffer disproportionately if sustainable fisheries are negatively affected, Welcoming in this regard the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, held in Apia from | to 4 September 2014, which focused on small island developing States as a special case for sustainable development, in view of their unique and particular vulnerabilities,
