reefs, cold water habitats, hydrothermal vents and seamounts, of certain human activities, Emphasizing the need for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships, Expressing deep concern at the adverse economic, social and environmental impacts of the physical alteration and destruction of marine habitats that may result from land-based and coastal development activities, in particular those land reclamation activities that are carried out in a manner that has a detrimental impact on the marine environment, Reiterating its serious concern at the current and projected adverse effects of climate change and ocean acidification on the marine environment and marine biodiversity, and emphasizing the urgency of addressing these issues, Noting with concern, in this regard, the findings by the World Meteorological Organization, in its annual Greenhouse gas bulletin, that, in 2016, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere surpassed 400 parts per million, and that changes in its concentration have never been recorded as happening, as based on measurements of carbon dioxide from ice core records, as fast as in the past 150 years, and the findings in its Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2017 that global mean temperatures in 2017 were about 1.1°C above the 1850 to 1900 average, Also noting with concern that the World Meteorological Organization, in its Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2017, highlighted that the world also continued to see rising sea levels, with some acceleration, and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, while the cryosphere continued its contraction, with global sea ice shrinking, Expressing concern that climate change continues to increase the severity and incidence of coral bleaching throughout tropical seas and weakens the ability of reefs to withstand ocean acidification, which could have serious and irreversible negative effects on marine organisms, particularly corals, as well as to withstand other pressures, including overfishing and pollution, Reiterating its deep concern at the vulnerability of the environment and the fragile ecosystems of the polar regions, including the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic ice cap, particularly affected by the projected adverse effects of climate change and ocean acidification, Recognizing the need for a more integrated and ecosystem-based approach to, further study of and the promotion of measures for enhanced cooperation, coordination and collaboration relating to the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, Recognizing also that the realization of the benefits of the Convention could be enhanced by international cooperation, technical assistance and advanced scientific knowledge, as well as by funding and capacity-building, Recognizing further that hydrographic surveys and nautical charting are critical to the safety of navigation and life at sea, environmental protection, including the 4/58 protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, and the economics of the global shipping industry, and encouraging further efforts towards electronic charting, which not only provides significantly increased benefits for safe navigation and management of ship movement, but also provides data and information that can be used for sustainable fisheries activities and other sectoral uses of the marine environment, the delimitation of maritime boundaries and environmental protection, and noting that, under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974,'? ships on international voyages are required to carry an electronic chart display and information system, in accordance with the implementation schedule as set out in that Convention,

protected and preserved, Recognizing the duty of States under article 303, paragraph 1, of the Convention to protect objects of an archaeological and historical nature found at sea and to cooperate for this purpose, Expressing concern, in this regard, at various threats posed to such objects, including their destruction as well as the illicit trafficking in such objects, Recognizing that illicit trafficking in wildlife is, in some cases, committed by transnational organized criminal groups using maritime routes, contributes to damage to ecosystems and livelihoods and requires enhanced regional and global cooperation and coordination in response, in accordance with international law, Noting with concern the continuing problem of transnational organized crime committed at sea, including illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, the smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons and illicit trafficking in firearms, and threats to maritime safety and security, including piracy, armed robbery at sea, smuggling and terrorist acts against shipping, offshore installations and other maritime interests, and noting the deplorable loss of life and adverse impact on international trade, energy security and the global economy resulting from such activities, Reiterating the importance of the fair treatment of crew members and its influence on maritime safety, Recognizing that fibre-optic submarine cables transmit most of the world’s data and communications and hence are vitally important to the global economy and the national security of all States, conscious that these cables are susceptible to intentional and accidental damage from shipping and other activities and that the maintenance, including the repair, of these cables is important, noting that these matters have been brought to the attention of States at various workshops and seminars, and conscious of the need for States to adopt national laws and regulations to protect submarine cables and render their wilful damage or damage by culpable negligence punishable offences, Noting the importance of the delineation of the outer limits of the continental shelf

Commission, Recognizing also the significant workload of the Commission in view of the large number of submissions already received and a number of submissions yet to be received, which places significant demands and challenges on its members and the secretariat as provided by the Secretary-General of the United Nations through the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the
