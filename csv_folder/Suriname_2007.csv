Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 9 See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report on the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006 (Rome, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006). 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Pérto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (c 2006/REP), appendix G.
