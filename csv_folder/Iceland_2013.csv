enabling their work in recent resolutions and the panel discussion on women human rights defenders convened on 26 June 2012, Acknowledging that women of all ages who engage in the defence of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and those related to gender, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, including in addressing all forms of human rights violations, combating impunity, fighting poverty and discrimination, and promoting access to justice, democracy, the full participation of women in society, tolerance, human dignity and the right to development, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through restrictions on freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings, Gravely concerned that women human rights defenders are at risk of and suffer violations and abuses, including systematic violations of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, at the hands of State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and social norms that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, Gravely concerned that impunity for violations against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, taboos with regard to gender-specific violations and abuses such as sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, intersecting or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, 2/6 Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Recalling the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, by State and non-State actors against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the role, behaviours and activities of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political, social and economic status are essential to respect for all human rights and the achievement of representative, transparent and accountable government, democratic institutions and sustainable

Also emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, where the need to protect public morals is invoked to justify restrictions, such restrictions must respect the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination and must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition, as the concept of morals derives from many social, philosophical and religious traditions; 14.

resolutions 16/5 of 24 March 20111 and 22/6 of 21 March 2013,2 Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and their review outcomes, as well as the agreed conclusions and resolutions of the Commission on the Status of Women, Acknowledging the attention given by the Human Rights Council to the importance of women human rights defenders and of ensuring their protection and enabling their work in recent resolutions, and noting the panel discussion on women human rights defenders convened on 26 June 2012, Acknowledging that women of all ages who engage in the defence of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and in issues related to gender equality, herein referred to as women human rights defenders, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, in the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through the curtailment of freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings, Gravely concerned that women human rights defenders are at risk of and suffer violations and abuses, including systematic violations and abuses of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, by State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated or abused and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and those social norms or patterns that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, 1 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/66/53), chap. II, sect. A. 2 Ibid., Sixty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/68/53), chap. IV, sect. A. 2/7 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing gender-based violence, including sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses, discrimination and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and can be a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Stressing the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the important activities and legitimate role of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Recalling that the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms rests with the State, and reaffirming that national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other international obligations of the State in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms is the juridical framework within which human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, conduct their activities, Gravely concerned that, in some instances, national security and counter- terrorism legislation and other measures, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, have been misused to target human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, or have hindered their work and endangered their safety in a manner contrary to international law, Recognizing the urgent need to address, and to take concrete steps to prevent and stop, the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, to exercise their work, including by reviewing and, where necessary, amending relevant legislation and its implementation in order to ensure compliance with international human rights law, 3/7 Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political, social, legal and economic status are essential to respect for all human rights, the growth and prosperity of society and the achievement of representative, transparent and accountable government, democratic institutions and sustainable development in all areas of life, Recognizing the valuable work of human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, in promoting civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, Welcoming the opportunity afforded by the post-2015 development agenda for the global community to advance the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons, including gender equality and non-discrimination, as well as real and effective participation, including equal political participation, in decision-making processes, Welcoming the steps taken by some States towards the adoption of national policies or legislation for the protection of individuals, groups and organs of society engaged in promoting and defending human rights, including as follow-up to the universal periodic review mechanism of the Human Rights Council, 1.

Reiterates strongly the right of anyone, individually and in association with others, to defend the human rights of women in all their aspects, and stresses the important role of women human rights defenders in promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, to which everyone is entitled without distinction of any kind, including in addressing all forms of human rights violations, combating impunity, fighting poverty and discrimination, and promoting access to justice, democracy, the full participation of women in society, tolerance, human dignity and the right to development, while emphasizing that everyone shall respect the human rights of others in accordance with the rights as well as the duties and responsibilities set out in the Declaration; 6.

Calls upon States to ensure that human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, can perform their important role in the context of peaceful protests, in accordance with national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and international human rights law, and in this regard to ensure that no one is subject to excessive or indiscriminate use of force, arbitrary arrest or detention, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, enforced disappearance, abuse of criminal and civil proceedings or threats of such acts; 8. Also calls upon States to exercise due diligence in preventing violations and abuses against human rights defenders and in combating impunity by ensuring that those responsible for violations and abuses, including gender-based violence and threats against women human rights defenders, committed by State and non-State actors, including online, are promptly brought to justice through impartial investigations; 9. Further calls upon States to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights are not criminalized or met with limitations in contravention of international human rights law and that women human rights defenders are not prevented from enjoying universal human rights owing to their work, including by ensuring that all legal provisions, administrative measures and policies affecting women human rights defenders, including those aimed at preserving public morals, are clearly defined, determinable, non-retroactive and compatible with international human rights law; 10. Underlines the fundamental principle of the independence of the judiciary, and that procedural safeguards must be in place in accordance with international human rights law in order to protect women human rights defenders from unwarranted criminal action and sanction as a consequence of their work in line with the Declaration; 11. Urges States to strengthen and implement legal, policy and other measures to promote gender equality, empower women and promote their autonomy and to promote and protect their equal participation, full involvement and leadership in society, including in the defence of human rights; 5/7 12. Invites leaders in all sectors of society and in their respective communities, including political, military, social and religious leaders and leaders in business and the media, to express public support for the important role of women human rights defenders and the legitimacy of their work; 13. Calls upon States to implement, effectively and expeditiously, Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1889 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106 (2013) and 2122 (2013) on women and peace and security, including through the provision of gender-sensitivity training for police officers and law enforcement personnel, inter alia, on the barriers that women human rights defenders face in gaining access to justice in armed conflict and post-conflict situations, ensuring the inclusion of sexual violence in the definition of acts prohibited by ceasefires and in provisions for ceasefire monitoring, and the exclusion of sexual violence crimes from amnesty provisions in the context of conflict resolution processes, as a step towards the effective protection of women, including women human rights defenders; 14. Strongly calls upon States to refrain from, and ensure adequate protection from, any act of intimidation or reprisal against women human rights defenders who cooperate, have cooperated or seek to cooperate with international institutions, including their family members and associates, and reaffirms the right of everyone, individually and in association with others, to unhindered access to and communication with subregional, regional and international bodies, in particular the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms; 15. Urges States to develop and put in place comprehensive, sustainable and gender-sensitive public policies and programmes that support and protect women human rights defenders, including by providing adequate resources for immediate and long-term protection and making sure that these can be mobilized in a flexible and timely manner to guarantee effective physical and psychological protection, while also extending protection measures to their relatives, including children, and otherwise to take into account the role of many women human rights defenders as the main or sole caregiver in their families; 16. Emphasizes the need for the participation of women human rights defenders in the development of effective policies and programmes related to their protection, recognizing their independence and expertise with regard to their own needs, and the need to create and strengthen mechanisms for consultation and dialogue with women human rights defenders, such as focal points for human rights defenders within the public administration, for example, through national mechanisms for the advancement of women and girls, where they exist, or other mechanisms, depending on the national and local context; 17. Urges States to adopt and implement policies and programmes that provide women human rights defenders with access to effective remedies, including by ensuring: (a) The effective participation of women human rights defenders in all initiatives, including transitional justice processes, to secure accountability for violations and abuses, and also ensuring that the guarantee of non-recurrence incorporates overcoming the root causes of gender-based violations and abuses in everyday life and institutions; 6/7 (b) Adequate access to comprehensive support services for those women human rights defenders who experience violence, including shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, medical care and legal and social services; (c) That women human rights defenders who are victims of sexual and other forms of violence are attended to by adequately trained and equipped personnel with gender sensitivity and expertise and are consulted during each step of the process; (d) That women human rights defenders are able to avoid situations of violence, including by preventing the occurrence or recurrence of such violence in the exercise of their important and legitimate role in accordance with the present resolution; 18.

B. 2/13 further recalling the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective across the United Nations system in relation to the girl child, Recalling the Secretary-General’s 2008-2015 campaign “UNiTE to End Violence against Women” and the call upon Governments, civil society, women’s organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire United Nations system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls, Taking note of the appointment by the Secretary-General of the first Envoy on Youth in line with the imperative, contained in his five-year action agenda, on “Working for and with women and young people”, Recognizing that chronic poverty remains one of the biggest obstacles to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children, including the girl child, Recognizing also that urgent national and international action is required to eliminate poverty, in particular extreme poverty, and noting that the ongoing effects of the global financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those headed by girls, Recognizing further that the phenomenon of child-headed households is linked to other economic, social and political realities, such as armed conflict, natural disasters, lack of economic empowerment and health inequities, and that a comprehensive approach to these problems is needed to resolve the issue of child- headed households, Deeply concerned about the serious social problem of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, and that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, the erosion of the extended family, the exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase in the number of child- headed households, Recognizing that child-headed households may result from the death of parents and/or legal guardians, and that children can become de facto heads of households owing to parental illness, whether physical or mental, parental neglect, the migration of parents or other such factors, Deeply concerned about the extreme vulnerability of children who are heads of households, particularly girls, who may be exceptionally negatively affected by the economic and care burdens placed on them at a young age, which in turn may lead to their having difficulty completing their education and increase their vulnerability to poverty, discrimination, trafficking and physical abuse, Deeply concerned also about the vulnerability of children, in particular the girl child, raised in child-headed households, who suffer from the lack of adult support and may be particularly vulnerable to poverty, mental and psychosocial trauma and physical vulnerability owing to, inter alia, food insecurity and poor nutrition, limited access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and communicable and non-communicable diseases, Deeply concerned further that children heading households may be subjected to stigma and discrimination owing to the fact that parental death is a result of 3/13 HIV/AIDS, and that children heading households may be at greater risk of HIV because of their vulnerability to violence and exploitation as they seek to support their households, Deeply concerned that, in situations of poverty, armed conflict, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies, the incidence of child-headed households increases and makes girl children particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, abuse, exploitation and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that an estimated 68 million girls?° are engaged in child labour and that many of them face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with domestic chores, which deprive them of their childhood and diminish their opportunities to benefit from education and decent employment in the future, Recognizing that the needs of girls vary, according to a number of factors, including their age, and that the risks of violence and discrimination that they face change over their life cycles, from childhood through adolescence, Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing further that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child, early and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the 20 International Labour Organization, Making progress against child labour — Global estimates and trends 2000-2012 (Geneva, 2013). 4/13 corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls is underrecognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded as a result of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Taking note with appreciation of the adoption by the Human Rights Council of its resolution 24/23 of 27 September 2013 entitled “Strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage: challenges, achievements, best practices and implementation gaps”, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and child birth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their employment opportunities and their and their children’s quality of life and violates and impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation in the next generation, as reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/146 of 20 December 2012, remains unfinished business, Stressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources and technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs and priorities of child-headed households and women and girls at risk of or subjected to child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, 5/13 Emphasizing that increased access to education for young people, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination, including in respect of their access to education, health- care services and employment, and the importance of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this regard, 1. Stresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of the girl child as provided to her under human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,’ the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,’ the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? and the Optional Protocols thereto‘ as a matter of priority; 2. Urges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)?! and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182)?2 of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 3. Urges all Governments and the United Nations system to strengthen efforts bilaterally and with international organizations and private sector donors in order to achieve the goals of the World Education Forum?? and to implement the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative, and calls for the reaffirmation and implementation of the commitments contained in the Education for All goals and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to gender and education; 4. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education, including communications and technology education, where available, for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive formal education, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurial training for young women and to tackle male and female stereotypes in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment, equitable compensation and decent work; 5. Calls upon States and the international community to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children and ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, improving the safety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring all schools are accessible, safe, secure and free from violence, and providing separate and adequate sanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families and children who become heads of households; 23 See United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Final Report of the World Education Forum, Dakar, Senegal, 26-28 April 2000 (Paris, 2000). 6/13 6. Calls upon States, with the support of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, as appropriate, to develop policies and programmes, giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education programmes, including age-appropriate sex education, with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, that support girls and enable them to acquire knowledge, develop self-esteem and take responsibility for their own lives, and to place special focus on programmes to educate women and men, especially parents, about the importance of girls’ physical and mental health and well-being; 7. Urges States to acknowledge the different needs of girls and boys during their childhood and adolescence and, as appropriate, to make differential investments that are responsive to their changing needs; 8. Calls upon all States, the United Nations system and civil society to take measures to address the obstacles that continue to affect the achievement of the goals set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action,’ as contained in paragraph 33 of the further actions and initiatives, including reviewing remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls in order to modify or abolish them and, where appropriate, strengthening national mechanisms to implement policies and programmes for the girl child and, in some cases, to enhance coordination among responsible institutions for the realization of the human rights of girls, including abolishing laws that discriminate against women and girls, and to mobilize all necessary resources and support in order to achieve those goals; 9.
