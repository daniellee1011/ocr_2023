of the African Group), Brazil, Dominican Republic*, Mexico, Uruguay*",2000,"Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance","The Commission on Human Rights, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenants on Human Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Reaffirming also its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally racism in all its forms and racial discrimination, and its conviction that racism and racial discrimination constitute a total negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Taking note of resolution 54/154 of 17 December 1999, in which the General Assembly welcomed the offer by the Government of South Africa to host the World Conference against Racism, Racial discrimination, Xenophobia and Related intolerance, Reaffirming its resolution 1998/26 of 17 April 1998, in which it recommended that the activities of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination should be focused on the preparatory process for the World Conference, Recalling the recommendations of the two World Conferences to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held in Geneva in 1978 and 1983, Bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in June 1993 (A/CONF.157/23), which call for the speedy and comprehensive elimination of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, any form of discrimination against, inter alia, Blacks, Arabs and Muslims, xenophobia, Negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, Particularly alarmed at the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as an institutionalized governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance taking place in segments of many societies and perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which are directed against migrant workers and their families, Reaffirming, in this regard, the responsibility of Governments for safeguarding and protecting the rights of individuals residing in their territory against crimes perpetrated by racist or xenophobic individuals or groups, Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion, Deeply concerned about the fact that the phenomenon of racism and racial discrimination against migrant workers continues to increase despite efforts undertaken by the international community to improve the protection of the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families, Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants (E/CN.4/2000/82), Noting with grave concern that, despite the efforts of the international community, the principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination, Noting also with grave concern that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase, Deeply concerned that those advocating racism and racial discrimination misuse new communication technologies, including the Internet, to disseminate their repugnant views, Aware that racism, being one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Recalling General Assembly resolution 48/91 of 20 December 1993, in which the Assembly proclaimed the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, beginning in 1993, and adopted the Programme of Action proposed for the Decade, Having examined the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance (E/CN.4/2000/16 and Add.1), Observing that the manifestations of contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance bode ill for the international community, that racist propaganda and incitement to racial hatred are spreading and that racism is taking increasingly violent forms, Stressing the need to recognize that acts of violence motivated by racial discrimination and xenophobia are crimes punishable by law, Also stressing the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, General 1.

The Secretary-General already operates a Trust Fund for the International Court of Justice (see A/47/444). The Permanent Court of Arbitration has established a Financial Assistance Fund. The burden of costs should not be a factor for States, in making the choices under article 287, in deciding whether a dispute should be submitted to the Tribunal, or in deciding upon the response to an application made to the Tribunal by others. For these reasons, it was decided to create a Trust Fund for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (“the Tribunal™). Object and purpose of the Trust Fund 3. This Trust Fund (“the Fund”) is established by the Secretary-General in accordance with General Assembly resolution XXX and pursuant to the Agreement on Cooperation and Relationship between the United Nations and the Tribunal of 18 December 1997 (General Assembly resolution 52/251, annex). 4. The purpose of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to States parties to the Convention for expenses incurred in connection with cases submitted, or to be submitted, to the Tribunal, including its Seabed Disputes Chamber and any other Chamber. 5. Assistance, which will be provided in accordance with the following terms and conditions, should only be provided in appropriate cases, principally those proceeding to the merits where jurisdiction is not an issue, but in exceptional circumstances may be provided for any phase of the proceedings. Contributions to the Fund 6. The Secretary-General invites States, intergovernmental organizations, national institutions, non-governmental organizations, as well as natural and juridical persons, to make voluntary financial contributions to the Fund. Application for assistance 7. An application for assistance from the Fund may be submitted by any State party to the Convention. The application should describe the nature of the case which is to be, or has been, brought by or against the State concerned and should 10 provide an estimate of the costs for which financial assistance is requested.

Promoting and developing the marine scientific and technological capacity of developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island States, with a view to accelerating their social and economic development, is essential for the effective implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“the Convention”). 2. Coastal States intending to establish the outer limits of their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of their territorial sea is measured are required by article 76 of the Convention to submit the relevant data and information to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (“the Commission”). In accordance with article 4 of annex II to the Convention, the particulars of such limits should be submitted to the Commission within ten years of the entry into force of the Convention for that State. For some States a submission should be made by 16 November 2004. 3. Developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, may face difficulties in complying with the time limit for submissions to the Commission. The Trust Fund is intended to assist these States in complying with the requirements relating to a submission to the Commission. 4. Under article 3, paragraph 1 (b), of annex II to the Convention, the Commission may provide scientific and technical advice, if requested by the coastal States concerned, during the preparation of the data to be submitted in accordance with article 76. 5. The Commission has adopted an outline for a five-day training course in order to facilitate the preparation of submissions in accordance with its Scientific and Technical Guidelines. The course is to be developed and delivered by interested Governments, international organizations and institutions which possess the necessary expertise and facilities. The Commission has likewise prepared a basic flow chart illustrating the preparation of submissions by coastal States. 6. The delineation of the continental shelf of a coastal State in accordance with article 76 and annex II to the Convention and annex II of the Final Act of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (“the Final Act”) requires a programme for hydrographic and geoscientific surveying and mapping of the continental margin. The complexity and scale, and hence the costs involved, of such a programme will vary greatly from State to State according to the different geographical and geophysical circumstances. A first approach will always involve an assessment of the particular case at hand, followed by planning of appropriate projects for further data acquisition. Such projects require the contracting of high- 13 level scientific/technical expertise and modern technology. By nature, the costs involved in such data acquisition projects are substantial. In addition to contributing to the Voluntary Fund herein established, the international community should make every effort to facilitate the full implementation of article 76 both financially and in any other possible way or capacity. 7. The initial assessment and the project planning itself will require qualifications in hydrography and geosciences in addition to a full understanding of the relevant provisions of the Convention. The final preparation of a submission to the Commission also requires high-level expertise in geosciences and hydrography. 8. The United Nations has extensive experience in providing assistance to countries for their industrial and economic development. This experience could be extended and utilized to assist States in implementing their rights and obligations under article 76 of the Convention. Objects and purpose of the Trust Fund 9. The Secretary-General, under the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, establishes the present Trust Fund (“the Fund”). The object of the Fund is to enable developing States, in particular the least developed coastal countries and small island developing States, to make an initial assessment of their particular case, make appropriate plans for further investigations and data acquisition, and to prepare the final submission documents when the necessary data have been acquired. 10. The data acquisition campaigns themselves are not the object of the Fund. 11. An initial assessment of the nature of the continental shelf of a coastal State is often made in the form of a desktop study, which is a review and compilation of all existing data and information. Decisions for further action and/or planning for further data acquisition and mapping projects will be based on such a study. 12. The purpose of the Fund is to provide, in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations: (a) Training to the appropriate technical and administrative staff of the coastal State in question, in order to enable them to perform initial desktop studies and project planning, or at least to take full part in these activities; (b) Funds for such studies and planning activities, including funds for advisory/consultancy assistance if needed. 13. The preparation of the final submission documents will have to meet the requirements of article 76 and annex II to the Convention (and for some States, annex II of the Final Act) and the Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission. The training should take this into account and aim at enabling the State’s personnel also to prepare most of these documents themselves. The preparation of the submission may induce costs that may be met by funds from the Fund (e.g. software and hardware equipment, technical assistance, etc.). 14 Contributions to the Fund 14. The Secretary-General invites States, intergovernmental organizations and agencies, national institutions, non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions as well as natural and juridical persons to make voluntary financial or other contributions to the Fund. Application for financial assistance 15. An application for financial assistance from the Fund may be submitted by any developing State, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, who are Members of the United Nations and party to the Convention. 16. The purpose of the financial assistance applied for should be specified. Financial assistance may be sought for the following purposes: (a) Training of technical and administrative staff; (b) Desktop study or other means to make an initial assessment of the nature of the continental shelf and its limits; (c) Working out plans for the acquisition of necessary additional data and mapping projects; (d) Preparation of final submission documents; (e) Advisory/consultancy assistance related to the above points. 17. Detailed information under each of these purposes should be provided as follows: (a) Training of technical and administrative staff The application shall be accompanied by: (i) A specification of the goal of the training and which positions the trainees are intended to fill afterwards; (i1) Information on the training institute(s) in question; (iii) A copy of the training course(s); (iv) The curriculum vitae of the trainees; (v) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. (b) Desktop study or other means to make an assessment of the nature of the continental shelf and its limits The application shall be accompanied by: (1) A short description of the aim of the study; (i) An overview map of the area in question; (iii) An overview, as complete as possible, of the database already available to the State; 15 (c) (iv) An outline of how the work will be done and what tools are available (software and hardware); (v) A specification of what will be done by the State’s own staff, and what will be contracted for; (vi) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. Working out plans for the acquisition of necessary additional data and mapping projects (d) (e) The application shall be accompanied by: (1) A summary of the status of knowledge of the continental margin, preferably based on a previous desktop study; (1)) A preliminary assessment of the needs for specific additional data and/or information in accordance with the requirements of article 76 and annex II to the Convention, and annex II of the Final Act; (iii) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. Preparation of final submission documents The application shall be accompanied by: (i) A specification of what kind of assistance is needed; (1)) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. Advisory/consultancy assistance related to the above points The application shall be accompanied by: (i) A copy of the contract between the Government and the technical or scientific expert in question; (1)) An itemized statement of the costs for which assistance is requested. 18. In all these cases the application shall be accompanied by an undertaking that the requesting State shall supply a final statement of account providing details of the expenditures made from the approved amounts, to be certified by an auditor acceptable to the United Nations. Consideration of applications 19. Each request for financial assistance shall be considered by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs (“the Division”), which acts as the secretariat of the Commission. 20. The Division may engage an independent panel of experts of the highest moral standing to assist in the examination of applications on the basis of section 4 above and to recommend the amount of financial assistance to be given. However, no sitting Commission member should serve on this panel of experts. The Division shall prepare and circulate to member States a list of prospective members of the 16 panel of experts. Any member of the expert panel opposed by a member State should not be included in the panel. The Division shall on an annual basis provide a list of the panel of experts as an annex to the Secretary-General’s annual report. 21. In considering the application, the Division shall be guided solely by the financial needs of the requesting developing State and availability of funds with priority given to least developed countries and small island developing States taking into account the imminence of pending deadlines. 22. Travel expenses and subsistence allowance are payable to independent experts engaged by the Division to consider applications. Granting of assistance 23. The Secretary-General will provide financial assistance from the Fund on the basis of the evaluation and recommendations of the Division. Payments will be made against receipts evidencing actual expenditures for approved costs. Application of article 5 of annex II to the Convention 24. Nationals of the coastal State making the submission who are members of the Commission and any Commission member who has assisted a coastal State by providing scientific and technical advice with respect to the delineation shall not be a member of the subcommission dealing with that submission but has the right to participate as a member in the proceedings of the Commission concerning the said submission. In an effort to promote transparency and to give full effect to article 5 of annex II to the Convention there should be full disclosure by Commission members, trust fund recipients and training sponsors to the Division of any pre- submission contacts. Reporting requirements for full disclosure 25. Interested Governments, international organizations and institutions who provide any training for which any costs are reimbursed by this Fund are strongly encouraged to provide the complete list of participants to the Division. 26. Commission members who participate in any activities pursuant to this Fund shall disclose this information to the Division. 27. Upon submission to the Commission of its information on the limits of its continental shelf pursuant to article 76 of the Convention, a coastal State that has received assistance from this Fund shall disclose this information, including the involvement of any Commission members. Application of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations 28. The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations shall apply to the administration of the Fund. The Fund shall be subject to the auditing procedures provided therein. 10. Reporting to the General Assembly 29. An annual report on the activities of the Fund, including details of the contributions to and disbursements from the Fund, will be made to the General Assembly. 17 11. Implementing office 30. The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs is the implementing office for the Fund and will provide the services required for the operation of the Fund. 12.
