and welcoming therefore the emphasis placed by States on the topic of sanitation, for instance in General Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, in which States committed to, inter alia, redouble efforts to close the sanitation gap through scaled-up ground-level action, as well as the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of Sanitation for All, pursuant to Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Concerned that the official figures do not fully capture the dimensions of drinking water safety, affordability of services and safe management of excreta and wastewater, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe and affordable drinking water and safely managed and affordable sanitation, and highlighting in this context the need to adequately monitor the safety of drinking water and sanitation in order to obtain data that capture those dimensions as a critical part of securing access to safe drinking water as well as the safe management of sanitation, Reaffirming that non-discrimination and equality are fundamental human rights principles, and concerned that inequalities in the realization of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation persist, inter alia, between urban and rural areas and between formal and informal areas in cities, and insisting that much remains to be done on safety, equality and non-discrimination issues, Concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including menstrual hygiene management, and the widespread stigma associated with menstruation have a negative impact on gender equality and the human rights of women and girls, Recognizing that, in realizing the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation as well as other human rights for a rapidly growing world population, States should increasingly pursue integrated approaches, such as the water, energy-and food security nexus, and strengthen their water resource management, including by improving their wastewater treatment and by preventing and reducing surface and groundwater pollution, Recalling General Assembly resolution 67/291, entitled “Sanitation for All”, in which the Assembly encouraged all Member States, as well as the organizations of the United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including hygiene promotion, the provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage and wastewater treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management, Affirming the need to adequately consider the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, in particular while defining concrete goals, targets and indicators, Reaffirming its encouragement to Member States to intensify global partnerships for development as a means to achieve and sustain the Millennium Development Goal targets on water and sanitation, Reaffirming also the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Reaffirming that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation is essential for the full enjoyment of life and to all human rights, and recalling that it is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and is inextricably related to the right to the highest A/HRC/27/L.11 attainable standard of physical and mental health, as well as to the right to life and human dignity, 1. Recalls that safe drinking water and sanitation must be progressively made available for present and future generations, without discrimination, and that the provision of services today should safeguard the ability in the future to realize the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 2.

Alarmed by the fact that, according to the 2014 Joint Monitoring Programme update, the percentage of the global population without access to an improved sanitation facility decreased by only 7 per cent between 1990 and 2012 and that, if current trends continue, the Millennium Development Goal target on sanitation will be missed by more than half a billion people, and calls upon all Member States to continue to support the global effort to realize the goals of the advocacy campaign “Sustainable sanitation: the five- year drive to 2015”, including action to eliminate the practice of open defecation, as called for by the Deputy Secretary-General on 28 May 2014; 4. Welcomes the fact that the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals proposed in its outcome document a goal on water and sanitation and targets on universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, highlighting in particular the dimensions of safety, affordability, adequacy, equality, participation and sustainability, that it proposed objectives to end open defecation and to improve wastewater treatment, and that special attention be given to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, and invites States to reflect adequately the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in the post-2015 development agenda; 5. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, the comprehensive, transparent and inclusive consultations conducted with relevant and interested actors from all regions for her thematic reports and the undertaking of country missions; 6.

Encourages all States to participate in the negotiations aimed at establishing a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes, as referred to in General Assembly resolution 68/304, and invites States participating in the negotiations to ensure that such a multilateral legal framework will be compatible with existing international human rights obligations and standards; 4.

the Human Rights Committee on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption, Recognizing the need for further discussion and in-depth study of issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age and to procedural safeguards, effective oversight and remedies, with a view to further practical guidance, grounded in international human rights law, on the principles of necessity, proportionality and legitimacy, Noting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance, “NETmundial”, held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 23 and 24 April 2014, taking note of the outcome of that meeting, which reiterated, inter alia, the need for human rights to underpin Internet governance and that the rights that people have offline must also be protected online, and recognizing that effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology will require an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement, Noting also that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communication technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information and democratic participation, Concerned that other human rights, such as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to seek, receive and impart information, the right to

data, and highlighting the need to further consider the linkages between mass surveillance and its effects on other human rights, 6 A/69/397. 7 A/HRC/23/40 and Corr.1. 2/4 Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, including data about communications, known as metadata, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, especially when undertaken on a mass scale, Noting that while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory and that any interference with the right to privacy must be necessary and proportionate to the pursuance of legitimate aims and not impair the essence of the right, Noting that surveillance, the interception of digital communications and/or the collection of personal data that involves a State’s exercise of power or effective control over communications infrastructure, regardless of its location, may engage its human rights obligations relating to the right to privacy, Emphasizing that the human rights obligations of a State regarding the right to privacy extend to the exercise of its regulatory jurisdiction over private parties that physically control data, regardless of their location, Recalling that private enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights and to prevent and address the adverse impacts of their activities on human rights, as set out, notably, in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, ® Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, 1.
