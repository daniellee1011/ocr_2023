management and strategic planning, in coordination with affected States, including through the use of open and disaggregated data, are crucial elements to ensure a better informed, more effective, transparent and collective response to the needs of people affected by crises, Reiterating the need for Member States, relevant United Nations organizations and other relevant actors to mainstream a
