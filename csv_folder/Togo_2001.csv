2001,General Assembly,N/A,Fifty-fifth session,N/A,United Nations Assnao,"In my capacity as the representative of the current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, I have the honour to request, in accordance with rule 15 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the inclusion on the agenda of the fifty-fifth regular session of the General Assembly of an additional item of great importance, for the purpose of proclaiming the decade 2001-2010 the “Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Africa”. In accordance with rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly,",N/A,I should be grateful if you would have this letter and its annexes circulated as a document of the General Assembly.,"(Signed) Roland Y. Kpotsra A/55/240 Annex I [Original: English] Explanatory memorandum It is to be recalled that the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its thirty-third ordinary session, held from 2 to 4 June 1997, issued the Harare Declaration on Malaria Prevention and Control in the Context of African Economic Recovery and Development. In addition to major declarations on health adopted by OAU, an African initiative for malaria control in the twenty-first century was undertaken and became Roll Back Malaria in Africa late in 1998. This move was given high consideration by the heads of State of Africa owing to the fact that malaria is one of the major causes of death in Africa. In effect, World Health Organization fact sheet No. 94 of October 1998 states that there are 300 to 500 million cases of the disease worldwide, 90 per cent of which are in Africa. In Africa, 5 per cent of children die before the age of 5 years from malaria and other illnesses associated with malaria. It is therefore in full recognition of the gravity of this disease and the barrier it constitutes to development and poverty alleviation that the African Summit on Roll Back Malaria, held at Abuja on 24 and 25 April 2000, emphasized and proposed an “African Malaria Control Day” and called upon the United Nations to declare the coming decade, 2001-2010, a decade for Roll Back Malaria. April 25 of each year was proposed as African Malaria Control Day. That proposal was endorsed by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government by decision AHG/Dec 155 (XXXVI), adopted at Lomé during the thirty-sixth ordinary session of the Assembly. As a whole the major focus is on controlling malaria in parts of the world, where it is endemic of which Africa forms the largest area. Roll Back Malaria, therefore, aims at mobilizing all society, at continental, national, and grassroots levels, in order to fight against this disease.

Notes with concern the persistence of the external debt problem, that the vicious cycle of debt and underdevelopment has become further entrenched, that debt service has grown at a much greater rate than the debt itself and that the burden of payments has become heavier in many developing countries, including those with low and middle incomes, despite repeated rescheduling, and that the current debt and poverty reduction and growth initiatives lack sufficient funding and have several conditions attached; 4. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session (resolution S-24/2, of 1 July 2000, annex, chap. ]) to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 5. Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based, inter alia, in open, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, predictable, transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems, which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 6. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and a consistent way, with the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the specific characteristics, conditions and needs of the debtor countries; 7. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment polices, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 8.

Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 10. Requests the independent expert to present an analytical report to the Commission, on an annual basis, on the implementation of the present resolution, paying particular attention to: (a) The effects of the foreign debt and the policies adopted to face them on the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular, economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries; (b) Measures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries; (c) New developments, actions and initiatives being taken by international financial institutions, other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with respect to structural adjustment policies and human rights; 11.

Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the 12. 16. population in the affected countries; 17. Recognizes that there is a need for more transparency, participation by all States and consideration of the relevant resolutions of the Commission in the deliberations and 17. activities of international and regional financial institutions; 18.

I, resolution 1), Governments committed themselves to endeavouring to ensure that all men and women, especially those living in poverty, could exercise the rights, utilize the resources and share the responsibilities that would enable them to lead satisfying lives and to contribute to the well-being of their families, their communities and humankind and committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty throughout the world through national actions and international cooperation, as an ethical, social, political and economic imperative of humankind, Recalling the report of the Secretary-General on women’s real enjoyment of their human rights, in particular those relating to the elimination of poverty, economic development and economic resources (E/CN.4/1998/22-E/CN.6/1998/11), Noting with satisfaction the progress report submitted by the independent expert in accordance with Commission resolution 2000/12 (E/CN.4/2001/54) and the conclusions contained therein, in particular concerning the importance of the knowledge of their rights by the poor themselves, the harnessing of their capacities to organize, training for the fight against poverty and the necessary general mobilization, as pillars of a global strategy against poverty, Taking note of the report of the Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty (E/CN.4/2001/54/Add.1 and Corr.1), organized by the High Commissioner for Human Rights in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2000/12, and its conclusions, 1. Reaffirms that: (a) Extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate them; (b) The right to life includes within it existence in human dignity with the minimum necessities of life; (c) It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the societies in which they live, in the realization of human rights and in efforts to combat extreme poverty and for people living in poverty and vulnerable groups to be empowered to organize themselves and to participate in all aspects of political, economic and social life, particularly the planning and implementation of policies that affect them, thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development; (d) The existence of widespread absolute poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and renders democracy and popular participation fragile; (e) For peace and stability to endure, national action and international action and cooperation are required to promote a better life for all in larger freedom, a critical element of which is the eradication of poverty; )] According to the observations contained in the reports submitted by the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, the lack of political commitment, not financial resources, is the real obstacle to the eradication of poverty; (2) Special attention must be given to the plight of women and children, who often bear the greatest burden of extreme poverty; 2.
