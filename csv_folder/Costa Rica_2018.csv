Resolution 70/1. 2/9 Expressing concern that the pace of change is not sufficient to eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030 and that, in some countries and contexts, rates are rising and that, without further acceleration, an additional 150 million girls under 18 years of age will be married by 2030, Recognizing that, in many contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage can take the form of informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious or State authority and that constitute similarly harmful practices that violate, abuse or impair human rights and are linked to and perpetuate other harmful practices and human rights abuses, that these practices should be addressed in the context of the response to child, early and forced marriage and that these informal unions and other informal arrangements present particular challenges that would be alleviated by the identification of and the gathering of data on informal unions and marriage ceremonies without registration and require particular responses for the girls and women affected, Expressing deep concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, discriminatory laws, policies and norms, as well as ingrained social bias, impair the recognition, enjoyment and exercise of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women, children and adolescents, as well as the empowerment of all women and girls, and are also root causes of child, early and forced marriage, Recognizing that poverty, insecurity, early and/or unintended pregnancy and lack of education are also among the primary drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing also that, overall, harmful practices are themselves a form of violence against women and children and are often associated with serious forms of violence and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence from their partners, and that violence against women and girls is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, which reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines the autonomy and decision-making of women and girls in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, leadership and meaningful agency and participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of extreme poverty, Recognizing men and boys as strategic partners and allies alongside women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence and child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, 3/9 Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming discriminatory social norms and confronting gender inequalities, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further that addressing child, early and forced marriage includes supporting the specific needs of married girls, as well as women, affected by this practice and of their children, and underscoring the importance of removing the structural barriers that prevent access to justice, safe and quality education, counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services, childcare, employment and vocational training, and the provision of adolescent-friendly health services, protection services and alternatives for those who choose to leave marriage, Noting with concern that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education and that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, and that educational opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, and that the practice exposes girls and women to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations and early and/or unintended pregnancy, increases the risk of obstetric fistula, high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and complications during pregnancy and childbirth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health care and services for mothers, and noting with concern that it is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, Noting with deep concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage is highly exacerbated during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict and natural disaster because of various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, misconceptions regarding the provision of protection through marriage, the use of child, early and forced marriage as a tactic in conflict, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption of social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, Recognizing that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require 4/9 appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, including in humanitarian emergencies and settings, with attention paid to the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and sexual exploitation in those situations, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, 1. Calls upon States, with the participation of relevant stakeholders, including women and girls, men and boys, parents and other family members, teachers, religious, traditional and community leaders, civil society, human rights defenders, faith-based organizations, women’s, human rights and youth-led organizations and groups, humanitarian actors, the media and the private sector, to develop and implement holistic, comprehensive, integrated and coordinated responses and strategies to prevent, respond to and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, to support girls and women who are at risk, already married girls, married, divorced and widowed women who were married as girls, women and girls fleeing child, early and forced marriage, and women and girls in early and forced informal unions, including through the strengthening of child protection systems, protection mechanisms such as safe shelters, access to justice and the sharing of best practices across borders; 2. Also calls upon States to adequately and equitably resource national and subnational action plans to end child, early and forced marriage and to ensure that these efforts are included in budget allocation across health, nutrition, protection, governance, education and other relevant sectors and that there is transparency, accountability and public participation in the budgeting process; 3. Urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and ending child, early and forced marriage and protecting those at risk and, consistent with the fundamental principles of domestic law, to actively integrate these laws and policies into existing local or subnational legal frameworks and traditional legal systems, to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses and that women and girls have equality with men and boys in all matters pertaining to marriage, divorce, child custody and the economic consequences of marriage and its dissolution; 4. Also urges States to enact, uphold, enforce and effectively monitor the implementation of laws concerning a minimum age of marriage and to progressively amend laws so that lower minimum ages of marriage and/or ages of majority are raised to 18, and to engage all relevant authorities to ensure that these laws are well known, disseminated, popularized and understood; 5. Further urges States to repeal or amend relevant laws and remove any provision that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims; 6. Calls upon States to strengthen their efforts to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages, bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls; 5/9 7. Also calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of and active consultation with children and adolescents, especially girls, on all issues affecting them, and to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, both offline and online, that provide girls, including already married girls, and boys with information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, to be empowered, to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities; 8. Further calls upon States to promote education about the harmful effects of child, early and forced marriage on the individual and wider society and the benefits of ending the harmful practice, including through open dialogue with all stakeholders, including girls and boys, women and men, religious, traditional and community leaders, parents, legal guardians and other family members, to empower all women and girls to make decisions about their own lives, work with local communities to combat negative social norms and gender stereotypes that condone child, early and forced marriage, and empower parents and communities to abandon the practice; 9.

'l See resolution 70/1. 2/9 of information on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Noting with concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Noting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of education are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major

are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty, and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls, Recognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and confronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, with the active support and engagement of 3/9 their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the importance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that respond to their specific needs, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision- making, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, 1.
