in particular the Sustainable Development Goals on ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture and on ending poverty in all its forms everywhere, Recalling the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in which the right of everyone to adequate food, including the fundamental right of every person to be free from hunger, is recognized, Please recycle GE.17-04518(E) A/HRC/34/L.21 Bearing in mind the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, adopted at the World Food Summit in November 1996, the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, adopted on 13 June 2002, and the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted on 16 November 2009, Reaffirming the importance of the concrete recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004, and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and its Framework for Action, adopted in Rome on 21 November 2014, Acknowledging that the right to food has been recognized as the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate, nutritious food, in conformity with, inter alia, the culture, beliefs, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of individuals, that is produced and consumed sustainably, thereby preserving access to food for future generations, Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, Reaffirming also that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming further that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment at both the national and international levels is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, Determined to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community with a view to achieving substantial progress in the realization of the right to food by an increased and sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, with a view to build a community of shared future for humanity, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, and the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies, where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Reaffirming that food security is a national responsibility, and that any plan for addressing food security challenges must be nationally articulated, designed, owned and led, and built on consultation with all key stakeholders, and recognizing the commitment to strengthening the multilateral system in the channelling of resources and in the promotion of policies dedicated to fighting hunger and malnutrition, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global A/HRC/34/L.21 dimension and that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to adequate food has been threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Recognizing further the need to urgently assist some African countries that are facing drought, starvation and famine threats that could affect millions of people, most of whom are women and children, who risk losing their lives, Recognizing that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and to sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, while noting the commitment to continuing the agricultural trade discussions as mandated by the World Trade Organization, Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights is taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to food, Recognizing the importance and positive role of smallholder and subsistence farmers, including women farmers, young farmers, family farmers and farmers in less favoured areas, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have, in combination with other factors, resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Recognizing the need to prioritize food security and end hunger, and the particular vulnerabilities of food systems to the adverse impact of climate change, and, given this situation, that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, Stressing the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, Recognizing the need to increase sustainable private and public investments in agriculture from all relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, which were endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security at its forty-first session, held in October 2014, A/HRC/34/L.21 Stressing the importance of the second International Conference on Nutrition, hosted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, at which the two main outcome documents, namely, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, were endorsed, Bearing in mind that excessive and unregulated exposure to pesticides can have severe impacts on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the right to food, as well as the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Recalling the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management, adopted by the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its thirty- eighth session, in June 2013, Recognizing the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and the right to food for all, Recognizing also the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 on 27 July 2012, and reaffirming the principles contained therein, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity, and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 795 million people in the world remain undernourished owing to the lack of sufficient food for conducting an active and healthy life, including as one of the effects derived from the global food crisis, while, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries; 5. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food- importing developing countries, especially least developed countries; 6. Expresses its great concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries A/HRC/34/L.21 girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Recognizes that reinforcing the rights of girls and women, especially those who are poor and vulnerable, to education and social protection and that increasing women’s participation in decision-making and access to resources in an objective manner are critical for enhancing women’s vital role in advancing agricultural development and food security, and recognizes also in that regard that the promotion of agro-industry through the voluntary dissemination of knowledge, the development and transfer of technology, capacity-building and financial support is a precondition for the involvement of women in advancing agriculture in developing countries; 8. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where such inequality and discrimination contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including by taking measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women and girls have equal access to social protection and resources, including income, land and water, and their ownership, and full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and to strengthen their role in decision-making; 9.

Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms that address the right to food and food insecurity to integrate and effectively implement a gender perspective in their relevant policies, programmes and activities regarding access to food; 11. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe, sufficient, nutritious and culturally accepted food are inclusive and accessible to persons with disabilities; 12. Encourages States to take steps with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the right to food for all, and to take steps to promote the conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food and, where appropriate, to consider establishing appropriate institutional mechanisms and to adopt national plans to combat hunger; 13. Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food, and encourages States to increase such cooperation as a complement to North-South cooperation and to promote triangular cooperation further; 14. Also recognizes the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, inter alia, traditional seed supply systems, including for many indigenous peoples and local communities; 15. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food, and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of national and regional A/HRC/34/L.21 efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, particularly through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, achieving food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and to ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 16. Calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under articles 2 (1) and 11 (2), in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 17. Calls upon States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all the measures necessary to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such a policy or measure; 18. Recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the right to food; 19. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 20. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concern over the obstacles and challenges to the full enjoyment of the right to food that indigenous peoples face, and calls upon States to take new actions to combat the root causes of the often disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 21. Welcomes the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, ' held on 22 and 23 September 2014, and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; ' General Assembly resolution 69/2. A/HRC/34/L.21 22.

Encourages all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security; 24. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitments and international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 25. Notes with appreciation the growing movement, in different regions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and measures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all; 26. Recognizes the importance of giving due consideration to the adverse impact of climate change on the full realization of the right to food; 27.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support with the goal of ensuring that all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases; A/HRC/34/L.21 34. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 35. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution to both the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, and the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities relating to emergency situations for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each State has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 36. Calls upon States to heed the urgent United Nations humanitarian appeal to assist countries facing drought, starvation and famine with emergency aid and urgent funding, and underlines that if no immediate response is received, an estimated 20 million people, most of whom are women and children, risk losing their lives; 37.

Notes with concern that by virtue of the decision of the United States Congress, under an act entitled “Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act” which mandated the establishment of the Financial Oversight and Management Board, the already weakened area in which the prevailing regime of political and economic subordination in Puerto Rico operates is reduced even further; 5. Notes the broad support of eminent persons, Governments and political forces in Latin America and the Caribbean for the independence of Puerto Rico; 6.

adverse impact of the consequences of the world financial and economic crisis, including on development, and evidence of an uneven, fragile and slow recovery, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts that helped to contain tail risks, improve financial market conditions and stability and sustain recovery, still remains in a challenging phase, with downside risks, including high volatility in global markets, excessive volatility of commodity prices, high unemployment, particularly among young people, unsustainable debt in some countries and widespread

developing countries continue to be highly dependent on primary commodities, and recognizing also the challenges and special needs of those countries, Stressing the critical importance of sustainable and inclusive industrial development for developing countries as a critical source of economic growth, economic diversification and value addition, Recognizing that uncertainty in global commodity

period of lower export and fiscal revenues, Noting also the volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices, which have threatened, inter alia, the food security of net importers in the recent past, and noting further that the continuation of this long-term uncertainty and volatility, intensified by recent trends in commodity prices, can have an impact on the capacities of many developing countries, particularly commodity-dependent countries, to continue to implement policies for achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication, Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify commodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development and

noting with concern that violations or abuses of the right to privacy might affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political

right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Emphasizing also that

Development therefore has a role to play in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Concerned at the global nature of poverty and inequality, underlining the fact that the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, and of hunger is an ethical, social, political and economic imperative of all humankind, and in this regard recognizing that there is a need to better understand the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, Reaffirming that each country faces specific challenges

income inequality and financial fragility, that trade has grown still more slowly, that, although interest rates are now beginning to rise, capital flows are again becoming volatile, that,

2007-2008 shocks in food and energy prices and the onset of the global financial and economic crisis that led to the great recession, as well as witnessed major natural disasters and an escalation of

societies and of the biological support systems of the planet are at risk, which further threaten food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and thus require urgent action to maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains achieved in the past decades, Welcoming the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate

nationally, regionally and internationally in order to address excessive commodity price volatility, Expressing concern that the global economy has yet to recover completely and remains in a challenging phase, notwithstanding the recent cyclical pickup in global economic activity, that growth remains weak in many countries and includes subdued trade growth, volatile capital flows, widespread fiscal strains and unsustainable debt in some countries, particularly developing countries, and that commodity exporters are particularly hard hit owing to their continued adjustment to a sharp step-down in foreign earnings, recognizing that, while short-term risks are broadly balanced, medium-term risks are still tilted to the downside, and in this regard stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances, to reform and strengthen the international financial system and to make further progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global

segmentation in education and labour markets and a lack of resources, as well as the heavy burden of unpaid work, make women and girls especially vulnerable to the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, Recognizing further that many developing countries continue to be highly dependent on primary commodities as their principal source of export revenues, employment, income generation and domestic savings and require additional sources of growth to become the driving force of investment, economic growth and social development, including poverty eradication, recognizing also the challenges and special needs of those countries, and stressing the critical importance of sustainable and inclusive industrial development for developing countries as a critical source of economic growth, economic diversification and value addition, Recognizing that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need to comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique,

situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable development, and to strengthen the nexus between, inter alia, trade, finance, investment in sustainable agriculture and food systems, energy

commodity net export economies may need to adjust to a possibly protracted period of lower export and fiscal revenues, 4/8 Noting also the volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices, which have threatened, inter alia, the food security of net importers in the recent past, and noting further that the continuation of this long-term uncertainty and volatility, intensified by recent trends in commodity prices, can have an impact on the capacities of many developing countries, particularly commodity-dependent countries, to continue to implement policies for achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication, Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify commodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development and poverty eradication strategies at all levels, Noting all relevant voluntary initiatives aimed at improving
