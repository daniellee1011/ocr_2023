Underlines the importance for sustainable development in mountains of exploring a wide range of funding sources, such as public-private partnerships, increased opportunities for microfinance, including microcredit and microinsurance, small housing loans, savings, education and health accounts, support for entrepreneurs seeking to develop small and medium-sized businesses and, where appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, debt for sustainable development swaps; 27. Notes that the awareness of the society as a whole needs to be raised in respect of the role of mountains as an important source of positive externalities® like biodiversity, flood and soil protection, water supply and quality, carbon sequestration, avalanche protection, fire protection, cultural landscapes, outdoor recreation as well as cultural heritage; 5 Externalities are defined as unaccounted side effects of an economic activity. They may be positive (e.g. preventing floods) or negative (e.g. causing floods). In mountain areas, the beneficiaries of such externalities are downstream water users, food consumers and tourists, while its providers are farmers and other mountain dwellers. In the first place, there is no market for externalities, so they cannot be bought or sold. However, a market can be created in which externalities are valorized. A/C.2/62/L.18 28. Underlines the importance of considering pro-poor national and international policies and national financing instruments, where appropriate, to compensate mountain populations and communities for the provision of such positive externalities; 29. Notes with satisfaction the adoption by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity® of a programme of work on mountain biological diversity, the overall purpose of which is the significant reduction of the loss of mountain biological diversity by 2010 at the global, regional and national levels, and its implementation, which aims at making a significant contribution to poverty eradication in mountain regions; 30.

Also notes with appreciation the Framework Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians,® adopted and signed by the seven countries of the region to provide a framework for cooperation and multisectoral policy coordination, a platform for joint strategies for sustainable development and a forum for dialogue between all involved stakeholders; 33. Further notes with appreciation the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, which promotes transboundary cooperation among eight regional member countries of the Himalaya Hindu Kush region to foster action and change for overcoming mountain peoples’ economic, social and_ physical vulnerability; 34.

Recognizes the efforts of the Mountain Partnership implemented in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 2003/61 of 25 July 2003, invites the international community and other relevant stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, to consider participating actively in the Mountain Partnership to increase its value added, and invites the Partnership secretariat to report on its activities and achievements to the Commission on Sustainable Development at its sixteenth session, in 2008, including in regard to the thematic issues of agriculture, rural development, land, drought and desertification; 40.
