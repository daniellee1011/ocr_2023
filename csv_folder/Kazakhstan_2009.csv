Mongolia, the Republic of India, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoy the status of SCO observer States. The charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization reaffirms the adherence of the member States to the goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as well as principles and norms of international law concerning maintenance of international peace, security and development of good-neighbourly and friendly relations as well as cooperation between States. Goals of the Organization: ¢ To strengthen mutual trust, friendship and good-neighbourliness between the member States. «To encourage efficient cooperation in such spheres as politics, trade and economy, science and technology, culture, education, energy, transport, environment and others. ¢ To consolidate efforts in maintaining and ensuring peace, security and stability in the region, building a democratic, fair and rational political and economic international order. The Council of Heads of the SCO member States is the SCO supreme governing body. It determines priorities and major areas of the Organization’s activities, decides on the fundamental issues of its internal arrangement and functioning, cooperation with other States and international organizations and considers the most urgent international problems. To implement the goals and tasks embodied in the SCO charter, the following bodies have been established: the Council of Heads of Government (Prime Ministers) of SCO member States, which approves the budget of the organization, considers and decides upon main issues pertaining to particular, especially economic, fields of development of cooperation within the Organization; the Council of SCO Foreign Ministers; and the Meetings of Heads of Ministries and Agencies of SCO member States (including ministers responsible for foreign trade, transport, education, culture, defence, etc.). Regular meetings of heads of law enforcement and Customs agencies, supreme and arbitration judges and attorneys general are conducted. There are committees of senior officials and expert working groups active within the Meetings of Heads of Ministries and Agencies. The Council of National Coordinators of SCO members States is the body that coordinates the Organization’s current activities, cooperation between the ministries and agencies of SCO member States. A/64/141 The following standing bodies of the Organization have been functioning since January 2004: ¢ The SCO secretariat in Beijing. Since 1 January 2007, Mr. Bolat Nurgaliev, Representative of the Republic of Kazakhstan, has been holding the post of Secretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. «The Executive Committee of the SCO Regional Anti-terrorist Structure in Tashkent. Since 1 January 2007, Mr. Myrzakan Subanov, Representative of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, has been holding the post of the Director of the Executive Committee of the SCO Regional Anti-terrorist Structure. Permanent representatives of the SCO member States are appointed to the secretariat and the Executive Committee of the SCO Regional Anti-terrorist Structure. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has enjoyed observer status with the United Nations General Assembly since 2004. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization cooperates closely with the United Nations system on most of its major areas of activity. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is its principal partner. Likewise, the prospects for joint work with the United Nations system in environmental protection, humanitarian and migration spheres look very promising. A memorandum of understanding was signed between SCO and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in January 2008 in order to strengthen the institutional framework of cooperation between the Organization and United Nations bodies. Thus, favourable starting conditions have been created for mutually beneficial cooperation between the United Nations and SCO. However, it is obvious that in order to enhance the practical component of this cooperation and ensure its synergy for the purpose of addressing common tasks in the socio-economic field, it is necessary to make relations between the Organization and the United Nations more systematic. This would be the aim of the General Assembly resolution, the of which is attached hereto (see annex II).

particular General Assembly resolutions 63/156 and 63/194 of 18 December 2008, and also its resolution 8/12 of 18 June 2008, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Reaffirming the principles set forth in relevant human rights instruments and declarations, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto, Recalling the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the protocols thereto, and reaffirming in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the Convention, and recalling the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as their origins, and that these forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Recognizing also that trafficking in persons violates human rights and impairs the enjoyment of them, continues to pose a serious challenge to humanity and requires a concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for it to be eradicated, Bearing in mind that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators, to rescue victims and to provide for their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims, Recognizing the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, Recognizing also the challenges to combating trafficking in persons, especially women and children, owing to the lack of adequate legislation and implementation of existing legislation, the lack of availability of reliable sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics and the lack of resources, Noting that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by trafficking in persons in some parts of the world, Recognizing that policies and programmes for prevention, rehabilitation, return and reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, transit and destination, Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, presented to the Council at its tenth session, Taking note with appreciation also of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the latest developments within the United

trafficking” of the General Assembly, held on 13 May 2009, which included a discussion on the advisability of a global plan of action against human trafficking, Welcoming especially the efforts of Governments, United Nations bodies and agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, Recognizing the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee against Torture at the persistence of trafficking and the vulnerability of victims to human rights violations, 1.

(b) To criminalize trafficking in persons in all its forms and to condemn and penalize traffickers, facilitators and intermediaries, including, where applicable, by imposing sanctions against legal entities involved in the process of trafficking, without making accusations by, or the participation of, the victims of trafficking a precondition to the prosecution of trafficking; (c) To ensure protection and assistance to the victims of trafficking with full respect for their human rights, including, where appropriate, through legislation; (d) To provide resources, as appropriate, for the comprehensive protection and assistance to victims of trafficking, including access to adequate social, necessary medical and psychological care and services, including those related to HIV/AIDS, as well as shelter, legal assistance in a language that they can understand and helplines, and to cooperate in this regard, as appropriate, with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations; (e) To take all appropriate measures to ensure that victims of trafficking are not penalized for being trafficked and that they do not suffer from revictimization as a result of actions taken by Government authorities, bearing in mind that they are victims of exploitation, and encourages Governments to provide trafficked persons with access to specialized support and assistance, regardless of their immigration status; (f) To devise, enforce and strengthen effective gender- and age-sensitive measures to combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking, especially in women and children, including for sexual and labour exploitation, as part of a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy that integrates a human rights perspective, and to draw up, as appropriate, national plans of action in this regard; (g) To adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures to discourage the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons and leads to trafficking in persons, including the demand created by sex tourism, especially in children, and forced labour, and to enhance, in this regard, preventive measures, including legislative measures, to deter exploiters of trafficked persons and to ensure their accountability; (h) To establish mechanisms, where appropriate, in cooperation with the international community, to combat the use of the Internet to facilitate trafficking in persons and crimes related to sexual or other forms of exploitation, and to strengthen international cooperation to investigate and prosecute trafficking facilitated by the use of the Internet;
