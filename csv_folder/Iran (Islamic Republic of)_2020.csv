recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impact of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, excessive volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, including land-locked developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of human-made and natural disasters, diseases and
