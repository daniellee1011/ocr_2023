RECOMMENDATION 4. To ensure prompt implementation of special procedures mandates, the Bureau recommends that the Commission consider the following options for a recommendation to ECOSOC: - Option 1. That ECOSOC adopt a general decision authorizing an immediate provisional start to the implementation of all new mandates proposed by the Commission, subject to confirmation during the Council's annual substantive session. - Option 2. That ECOSOC consider the holding of a brief session each spring, immediately following the Commission's session, to consider all Commission proposals regarding special procedures mandates. - Option 3. That ECOSOC's regular May organizational session include on its agenda the consideration of the Commission's proposals regarding special procedures mandates. RECOMMENDATION 5. The Commission's established practice of setting and renewing mandates for thematic mechanisms on the basis of a standard three-year term has proven valuable in ensuring continuity and permitting effective work-planning. RECOMMENDATION 6. The Bureau recommends that any individual's tenure in a given mandate, whether thematic or country-specific, be no more than six years. As a transitional measure, officeholders who may have served more than three years when their current mandates expire should be limited to at most ndividuals would be - three years of further renewals in those posts. Al eligible for reassignment to other mandates. RECOMMENDATION 7. At each session of the Commission, there should be conducted regular, focused and systematic deliberations on serious incidents or situations involving a failure or denial of cooperation by Governments with the Commission or its mechanisms. These deliberations should be an integral part of the procedure, proposed in recommendation 9 below, for Commission deliberations on the reports of special procedures. RECOMMENDATION 8: (a) Annual reports to the Commission should continue, wherever possible, to be submitted by the middle of December; (b) Advance, unedited copies of all reports in the original language should be made available to delegations as soon as they are submitted to OHCHR (in the same manner as such copies of ECOSOC reports are made available to Council members) ; (c) All reports should include an executive summary, no longer than four pages, reflecting all key elements which should form the basis for the Commission's deliberations on the report in question. This document should be structured to highlight the mechanism's principal observations, conclusions and recommendations, and highlight any observations or recommendations on the issue of follow-up on prior recommendations and on the question of cooperation of Governments with the mechanism. OHCHR should develop standard formats for such executive summaries for thematic and for country-specific mechanisms; (d) The executive summaries of all reports should be given the highest priority by the Languages Service and be issued in the framework of a compilation of all such executive summaries. This compilation would include a separate chapter highlighting any observations or recommendations concerning serious incidents or situations involving a failure or denial of cooperation with the Commission or its mechanisms; (e) Mechanisms could continue to orally supplement or update their annual reports to reflect any relevant developments in the period following submission of the initial report. Where it is necessary to provide such updates in writing, this would be done in a document of no more than two pages unless a longer document 1s needed to report on a new mission or major new development; (£) Outside the framework of regular annual reports, special mission reports or reports addressing critical or urgent developments in situations should continue to be submitted for appropriate action and processing, and brought to the Bureau's attention. RECOMMENDATION 9: (a) In addition to formal presentations of special procedures reports and responses of concerned States, the Commission's deliberations in respect of each mechanism's report should include a more focused, systematic dialogue on: The observations and recommendations of each mechanism; The extent to which current and relevant past recommendations have been addressed or followed up by concerned parties; and Any related concerns about the degree of cooperation offered to the Commission and its mechanisms by the directly concerned Governments, including with respect to requests for agreement to receive a direct visit. (ii) (iii) (b) The executive summary of each mechanism's report (see recommendation 8), and any supplementary/updated information brought to the Commission's attention by the mechanism or by the Government concerned, would afford the principal basis for organizing discussion during these dialogues; (c) In this process, the Government concerned should be encouraged, and offered every reasonable opportunity, to explain its position on the issues at hand; (d) While recognizing that it may not be possible to have all documentation available in the envisaged form for 1999, the Bureau recommends that, in considering the reports of its special procedures at its fifty-fifth session, the Commission take all practicable steps possible to organize the type of dialogue envisaged above. RECOMMENDATION 10: (a) The Bureau recommends that OHCHR, in collaboration with the special procedures, prepare and compile in a single document, to be issued in late September each year, a summary report on the progress realized and steps taken to date in connection with the recommendations of the mechanisms and the conclusions of the annual session of the Commission; (b) This document would be reviewed in meetings of the Bureau, held in advance of the human rights debate of the General Assembly. In these meetings, the Bureau would consider any appropriate steps it might take, or advice it might offer to concerned parties, to assist in advancing the process of implementation or follow-through on the recommendations of the mechanisms or conclusions of the Commission. These meetings could include private dialogues with representatives of concerned States; (c) At the conclusion of this annual Bureau review meeting, the Bureau would conduct a public briefing for representatives of all Commission members on any observations or conclusions it may consider appropriate to report. RECOMMENDATION 11. The Bureau recommends that the Commission's confidential (a) Deliberations to select situations which should be brought to the attention of the Commission should be conducted by a single body, a Committee on Situations, comprised of five independent experts appointed each year by the Chair of the Commission (no individual to serve more than three years), and meeting twice per year: (1) First, at the beginning of September to examine monthly summaries of communications prepared by the secretariat, originals of communications and any government replies received to date. At that time the Committee would decide which communications it should refer to States for clarification, requesting that any replies on time for the next meeting; and (1ii) Second, 1in January, to examine dossiers on concerned, including original communications, replies received from Governments and any addition information from other United Nations sour be submitted the situations al relevant ces, including treaty monitoring bodies and special procedures. The Committee would then determine whether or the situatio consideratio n, ns before it to the Commission and prepare a summary repor not to refer for its t identifying the main issues of concern and suggested ways of addressing those concer form of draf ns, but would not make recomme resolutions or decisions; Deliberations at the Commission level would also ndations in the involve two (ii) phases: (1) A closed meeting at the earliest possible stage in the session, to which the Governments concerned would be invited, to undertake a meaningful dialogue with the Commission ; and (1ii) A second closed meeting, towards the conclusion of the session, and in the presence of the Governments concerned, to decide on appropriate action, including a decision whether to continue or discontinue consideration of the matter within the confidential procedure, or whether to take up the mat should be cooperatio (c) At the conclusio ter in the Commission's public proceedings - which the principal option in cases in which government n has been inadequate; n of a session, the Chair of the Commission should announce publicly the names of the countries considered, the main issues of concern and the course of ac tion which the Commission has decided to take; (d) OHCHR would continue to play a crucial role in providing the necessary support for the procedure to ensur ffective performance of all the necessary tasks, inter alia: (ii) - Ensuring appropriate acknowledgement, and referral to concerned Governments, of communications received; - Sifting out communications that appear to be manifestly unfounded; - Ensuring that Governments concerned are kept appropriately and punctually advised of any decision taken in the Committee that requires their attention; - Preparing material/dossiers for deliberations by the Committee and the Commission. RECOMMENDATION 12: (a) Reflecting the role of the Sub-Commission in assisting the Commission to address a broad range of human rights issues, it should be renamed “the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights”; (b) Reflecting the proposed sharpening of the Sub-Commission's role as an independent expert body focusing its attention on priorities determined by the Commission: (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to (1) The membership of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to consultation with the Bureau, qualifications, to serve a four-year term, maximum of one additional four-year term. on the basis of their expert renewable for a To preserve the image of the Sub-Commission as an independent expert body, no member should be concurrently employed in the executive branch of their country's Government; (ii) The length of annual sessions of the Sub-Commission should be reduced to two weeks; (c) The Sub-Commission's work and priorities should be based on tasks entrusted to it by the Commission on Huma on the elaboration of studies, research a n Rights, with the principal focus nd expert advice at the request of the Commission. The Commission should regard the Sub-Commission's experts as i1ts foremost resource for the performa than appointing others to undertak considering the assignment of projec nce of such assignments, rather xpert research and analysis; and in ts to the Sub-Commission, the Commission might consider relevant proposals from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, from other United Nations human righ CS institutions and from the Sub-Commission itself; (d) The Sub-Commission's wor and study projects should, consistent king methods in respect of its research with th independent xpert character of (ii) the body, entail a well-prepared, thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question, any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of major observations of members of the Sub-Commission. This approach would preclude the need for negotiating traditional resolutions for submission to the Commission. While the Sub-Commission's deliberations should provide opportunities for interested Governments, international organizations and NGOs to provide input into this process, the experts should also be prepared to dedicate adequate time to private deliberations on their projects, inter alia in the framework of sessional working groups such as the existing working group on the administration of justice; (e) Recognizing the important opportunities the Sub-Commission and some of its subsidiary bodies play in affording a public forum for concerned parties to raise their human rights concerns: (1) The Sub-Commission should continue to conduct an annual debate on human rights violations in all parts of the world. However, rather than leading to the negotiation of resolutions, this debate should be reflected in a summary to the Commission as part of the Sub-Commission's annual report; (i1) The Sub-Commission's inter-sessional Working Groups on Minorities and on Indigenous Populations should continue to perform the valuable work they ar ngaged in, the latter until such time as the question of its future status is resolved in the context of the Commission's deliberations on a permanent forum for indigenous people in the United Nations system. The question of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery is addressed in recommendation 1 above; (f) As regards transitional arrangements associated with these proposed changes, the Bureau recommends that the Commission devise a transitional process aimed at bringing the recommended reforms fully into effect for the fifty-second session of the Sub-Commission in the year 2000. RECOMMENDATION 13: (a) Before referring any matter to a working group, the Commission on Human Rights should, where the needed groundwork has not been otherwise laid, request the Sub-Commission to undertake a study on the question at hand and (ii) prepare a text of the instrument envisaged. Among the issues to be addressed in any such study, and in the Commission's deliberations on whether to proceed, careful consideration should be given to the purposes of any ing exercise and to the guidelines set out in General Assembly resolution 41/120; (b) In creating any standard-setting working group, the Commission should consider and agree on a specific time-frame within which the group would be called upon to complete its task. This could vary depending on the complexity of the issue and the nature of the instrument (e.g. a procedural protocol might reasonably be completed within two or three years), but in any event the established time-frame should not exceed five years. If, by the end of its mandate, the working group has not been able to achieve a result, the Commission should set a period of reflection (such as one or two years) before any extension is provided; (c) Regarding the question of concluding a standard-setting exercise with or without a vote, it should be borne in mind that there is no rule of procedure requiring the Commission on Human Rights, ECOSOC or the General Assembly to adopt standard-setting instruments by consensus, and there are indeed examples where consensus has not been achieved. O0Of course, all efforts should be made at reaching consensus; (d) Finally, all working group chairs (whose terms should be linked with that of the working group) should have standing authority to undertake, between working group meetings, informal contacts and consultations with a view to advancing progress in respect of the working group's mandate. Results of such consultations should be communicated to concerned delegations on a timely basis and at the start of each session.",04/23/1999,1999_1489910,Uruguay,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council. 1503 procedure be amended in the following ways: 15 members, nominated by the Chair of the Commission in",yes
