Notes with concern the persistence of the external debt problem, that the vicious cycle of debt and underdevelopment has become further entrenched, that debt service has grown at a much greater rate than the debt itself and that the burden of payments has become heavier in many developing countries, including those with low and middle incomes, despite repeated rescheduling, and that the current debt and poverty reduction and growth initiatives lack sufficient funding and have several conditions attached; 4. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session (resolution S-24/2, of 1 July 2000, annex, chap. ]) to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 5. Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based, inter alia, in open, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, predictable, transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems, which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 6. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and a consistent way, with the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the specific characteristics, conditions and needs of the debtor countries; 7. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment polices, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 8.

Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 10. Requests the independent expert to present an analytical report to the Commission, on an annual basis, on the implementation of the present resolution, paying particular attention to: (a) The effects of the foreign debt and the policies adopted to face them on the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular, economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries; (b) Measures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries; (c) New developments, actions and initiatives being taken by international financial institutions, other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with respect to structural adjustment policies and human rights; 11.

Acknowledges with appreciation the process of the mid-term global evaluation of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education undertaken from April to August 2000 by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which included the launching of a worldwide survey, the organization of an on-line forum, the convening of an expert meeting and the preparation of the High Commissioner’s mid-term evaluation report; 2. Takes note with appreciation of the mid-term evaluation report of the High Commissioner (A/55/360), which includes an analysis of available information on progress made in the first five years of the Decade at the national, regional and international levels and recommendations for action during the remaining years of the Decade; 3.

Requests the High Commissioner to bring the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation report and the present resolution to the attention of all members of the international community and of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with human rights education and public information, and to report to the Commission at its fifty-eighth session on progress made towards the implementation of the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation report, for consideration under the same agenda item. Annex Recommendations of the mid-term global evaluation of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education (1995-2004) (excerpted from document A/55/360) 129. The following main findings of the mid-term global evaluation provide the basis for the following recommendations: (a) Obligations of States. States Members of the United Nations have unanimously proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, thereby making commitments relating to human rights education, as set out in General Assembly resolution 49/184. Prior to the Decade, Member States had ratified human rights treaties which contained provisions on human rights education, thereby setting themselves treaty obligations with regard to education in general and human rights education in particular. The evaluation, however, reveals that effective national strategies for human rights education have very rarely been developed; (b) United Nations system. The United Nations system has yet to adopt a system-wide response to the Decade, even though the United Nations reforms currently under way call for a system-wide mainstreaming of human rights in all United Nations activities, from needs and country assessment to priority-setting, programming, monitoring and evaluation; (c) National and local actors. National and local actors have contributed greatly towards the achievement of the goals and objectives of the Decade. As indicated above, the Decade has been a catalyst in eliciting a response from Governments but the response has been uneven and clearly much more needs to be done. Both the United Nations and its Member States have repeatedly recognized the invaluable contribution of non-governmental organizations to human rights education. The present review reconfirms that non-governmental organizations are key actors in that field, and that the Decade is slowly but increasingly proving to be a catalyst and an umbrella for their efforts. There is a growing need, however, for increased collaboration and coordination between governmental and non-governmental actors in respect of their human rights education activities; (d) Regional cooperation. The importance of regional and sub regional approaches is clearly reflected in the work of non-governmental actors at those levels. The present review, however, indicates that while there are well-established intergovernmental regional structures, both within and outside the United Nations, the potential of such structures to contribute to the realization of the goals of the Decade remains largely unfulfilled; (e) Monitoring, implementation and evaluation. Despite the considerable efforts of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is clear from the experience of the first five years of the Decade that monitoring and evaluation of the Decade need to be strengthened at all levels (international, regional, sub regional, national and local) and by all actors (intergovernmental, governmental and non-governmental alike); (f) Resources. An enormous gap remains between the commitments and obligations made in connection with the Decade, the expectations raised, and the resources actually committed at every level. This gap must be filled as a matter of urgency, if the remaining years of the Decade are to leave a strong foundation of achievement for subsequent work which will truly meet the needs of all for human rights education. Sustainability of activities beyond the Decade is a crucial issue since, as the Decade itself clearly demonstrates, human rights education is indeed a lifelong process. A. Overall recommendations 130. Set out below are overall recommendations directed at all principal actors and for implementation at all levels. Human rights education: concepts and methods 131. Value-oriented human rights education alone is insufficient. Human rights education should make reference to human rights instruments and mechanisms of protection, and to procedures for ensuring accountability. 132. Creative participatory teaching methods that are relevant to peoples’ lives should be used, and human rights should be introduced as a holistic framework. 133. Gender sensitivity should be emphasized in all educational activities. 134. An enabling environment for human rights educators (including the provision of information, training, facilities, equipment and protection from harassment) should be ensured. 135. Priority should be given to sustainable approaches (i.e., training of trainers, integration of human rights into all relevant training and educational curricula etc.). Content of human rights education 136. Activities for human rights education should address the following issues: (a) Economic, social and cultural rights; (b) Good governance; (c) Impunity, and international criminal tribunals to deal with crimes against humanity; (d) Human rights defenders (and the related United Nations declaration), racism and discrimination. 137. The link between development and human rights should be stressed. 138. The universality and indivisibility of human rights should be emphasized. Programmes on human rights education 139. Sufficient attention should be paid to ensure that the human rights education needs of children and young people, as well as of adults, are met. 140. Interaction among children and youth belonging to different ethnic communities should be promoted. Human rights education should be fostered within and outside school curricula. 141. Human rights education should be promoted in all educational initiatives aimed at adults. 142. Human rights education efforts aimed at the following targets should be increased: (a) Local government officials, community leaders (both secular and religious); (b) Legal and paralegal service providers; (c) Rural populations and illiterate people; (d) Women and girls; (e) Vulnerable groups, such as people with HIV/AIDS, people with disabilities, minorities and the elderly; (f) Non-state actors, such as multinational corporations, trade and financial organizations (World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund etc.). 143. The utilization of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education for mobilization and the establishment of partnerships should be increased. Evaluation, research and monitoring 144.Evaluation and studies and research of long-term impact should be undertaken in order to better understand which approaches work best and why, and in order to elaborate evaluation criteria. Every project on human rights education should incorporate the development of indicators to evaluate qualitative impact. Mass media and freedom of information 145.Mass media strategies that would effectively promote human rights should be developed. Such strategies might include the following elements: (a) Media focus on human rights monitoring; (b) Increasing the use of the media by non-governmental organizations; (c¢) Training of media professionals on mechanisms for human rights protection; (d) Involvement of the community of artists; (e) Use by the media, when appropriate, of techniques of social marketing. 146. Law reform, policies and practices that improve access to information and strengthen mechanisms that facilitate the flow of information and freedom of the press and other media should be promoted and implemented more vigourously. Human rights education should focus on such law reform policies and practices. 147. The possibilities offered by new information technologies in furthering human rights education should be better exploited, and access to such technologies should be increased. Existing programmes supporting the online development of projects on human rights education should be strengthened and new programmes implemented. Resources 148.Good practices for human rights education should be identified, compiled and disseminated. 149. Organizational capacity-building in human rights education should be fostered. 150. Funding for human rights education should be increased. 151.Research on issues related to human rights education should be enhanced in academic institutions and human rights institutes. 152. When appropriate, alliances with the business sector should be developed in support of human rights education. B. National level 153. Governments should reaffirm the commitments and obligations that they have already made in respect of human rights education and accelerate their pace of implementation so as to realize significant achievements by the end of the Decade. 154. Governments should promote the development of national strategies for human rights education which are comprehensive (in terms of outreach), participatory (in terms of involvement of all relevant actors), effective (in terms of educational methodologies) and sustainable (over the long term). Such strategies could be embodied in a national plan of action for human rights education (the relevant United Nations guidelines provide guidance in this regard). 155. Human rights education should be included as a component of national development plans and of other relevant national plans of action (general plans of action on human rights or those relating to women, children, minorities, indigenous peoples etc.). 156. All governmental and non-governmental actors should recognize, in a spirit of mutual respect, each other’s potential and capacities in furthering human rights education. Partnerships should be established where cooperation (rather than co-option) is furthered. Maximum use should be made of existing programmes, materials and resources. 157.Systems for better coordination of effort and greater cooperation among the various governmental agencies should be developed. 158. Non-governmental organizations should develop and implement strategies to encourage Governments to fulfil their obligations to integrate human rights education into all forms and levels of education for children, youth and adults, and should monitor those strategies. 159. International resources and materials should be adapted to local linguistic and cultural contexts. C. Regional level 160.Key regional human rights education organizations, institutions, agencies and networks should be supported (or, if necessary, established) to develop further the human rights education capacity within regions, including support for regional meetings, training of trainers, online networking, sharing of region-specific materials etc. 161. Region-specific programmes or coordination systems to maximize the participation of national entities (whether governmental or non-governmental) in programmes on human rights education should be developed. Such region-specific programmes can be linked to existing regional programmes supported by the United Nations. 162. Strategies should be developed for the wider distribution of materials on human rights education through regional networks. 163. Links should be established with regional mass media, social development and other groups to encourage the inclusion of human rights in their training programmes. 164. Existing regional intergovernmental organizations should be encouraged to integrate human rights education into their programmes and to allocate additional resources in that regard within the framework of the Decade. 165. Work with regional, education-related intergovernmental organizations should be enhanced in order to promote human rights education. D. International level 166. United Nations institutions should adopt a system-wide approach to the Decade. An effective coordination system should be developed and the role of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in such a system should be strengthened. 167. Effective human rights training should be undertaken for all United Nations staff. 168. Human rights education should be included in the agenda of the special session of the General Assembly on the follow-up to the World Summit for Children, 2001. 169. The Office of the High Commissioner, as requested by the General Assembly, should monitor the developments in human rights education that take place during the Decade. In this regard, Governments should provide adequate means to enable the Office to fulfil that role. 170. UNESCO, through its network of national commissions, should play an active part in encouraging Governments to develop human rights curricula for formal education and to take steps to ensure that school environments are conducive to human rights education. 171. United Nations treaty bodies should emphasize the obligations of States parties with regard to human rights education by actively seeking detailed information during their review of the reports of State parties. Inadequacies in addressing priority target audiences should consistently be identified by treaty bodies as an area of concern. In addition, treaty bodies should perform a clearing-house role by sharing with Governments approaches and strategies that have proven successful elsewhere, and should keep the Office of the High Commissioner informed of major national developments in human rights education. 172. The capacity for human rights education of national presences of intergovernmental organizations (United Nations resident coordinators, field presences of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations information centres, national and local offices of United Nations agencies etc.) should be strengthened so that they can provide technical support to national and local activities for human rights education. 173. Intergovernmental organizations should facilitate collaboration between governmental institutions and non-governmental organizations at the national level. 174. Educational materials developed by international organizations should be made easily accessible, distributed free of charge and translated into local languages. 175. The potential support and contribution to human rights education by non-state actors, including the business community, as well as development, trade and financial organizations, should be explored.",04/20/2001,2001_438837,Tunisia,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council.",yes
