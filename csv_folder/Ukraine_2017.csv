important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Emphasizing also that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment is important to the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to privacy, Noting that violations and

interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular
