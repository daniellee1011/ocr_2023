V.10-53897 Annex Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Preamble 1. The multifaceted nature of violence against women necessitates different strategies to respond to the diverse manifestations of violence and the various settings in which it occurs, both in private and public life, whether committed in the home, the workplace, educational and training institutions, the community or society, in custody, or in situations of armed conflict and natural disaster. In the Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the importance of adopting a systematic, comprehensive, coordinated, multisectoral and sustained approach to fighting violence against women is recognized. The practical measures, strategies and activities described below can be introduced in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice to address violence against women. Except where otherwise specified, the term “women” encompasses “girl children”’. 2. Violence against women exists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace. Violence against women is rooted in historically unequal power relations between men and women. All forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and have serious immediate and long-term implications for health, including sexual and reproductive health, for example through increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and public safety, and have a negative impact on the psychological, social and economic development of individuals, families, communities and States. 3. Violence against women is often embedded in and supported by social values, cultural patterns and practices. The criminal justice system and legislators are not immune to such values and thus have not always regarded violence against women with the same seriousness as other types of violence. Therefore, it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligation with respect to its elimination and that the criminal justice system recognize violence against women as a gender-related problem and as an expression of power and inequality. 4. Violence against women is defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and reiterated in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women? to mean any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or a General Assembly resolution 48/104. ’ Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annex 1. V.10-53897 suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures build on the measures adopted by Governments in the Platform for Action, which was adopted in 1995 and subsequently reaffirmed in 2000 and 2005, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted in 1997, and relevant General Assembly resolutions, including Assembly resolutions 61/143 and 63/155, bearing in mind that some groups of women are especially exposed and vulnerable to violence. 5. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures specifically acknowledge the need for an active policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies, programmes and practices to ensure gender equality and equal and fair access to justice, as well as establishing the goal of gender balance in all areas of decision-making, including those related to the elimination of violence against women. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be applied as guidelines in a manner consistent with relevant international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,° the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4 the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,¢ the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,‘ the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime,i with a view to furthering their fair and effective implementation. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures reaffirm the commitment of States to promote gender equality and empower women with a view to meeting goal 3 of the Millennium Development Goals.i 6. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be endorsed by national legislation and implemented by Member States and other entities in a manner consistent with the right to equality before the law, while also recognizing that gender equality may sometimes require the adoption of different approaches that acknowledge the different ways in which violence affects women as compared to men. Member States should ensure that women have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice in order to facilitate efforts by Governments to prevent and sanction acts of violence against women through comprehensive and coordinated policies and strategies, and to deal with all forms of violence against women within the criminal justice system. 7. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women must be focused on the needs of victims and empower individual women who are victims of ¢ United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, No. 20378. d Tbid., vol. 1577, No. 27531. e Ibid., vol. 2171, No. 27531. f Ibid., vol. 999, No. 14668. & Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. h Tbid., vol. 2187, No. 38544. i Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. ji A/56/326, annex. V.10-53897 violence. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at ensuring that prevention and intervention efforts are made to not only stop and appropriately sanction violence against women, but also restore a sense of dignity and control to the victims of such violence. 8. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at contributing to de jure and de facto equality between women and men. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures do not give preferential treatment to women but aim at ensuring that any inequalities or forms of discrimination that women face in accessing justice, particularly in respect of acts of violence, are redressed. 9. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that sexual violence is an issue of international peace and security, as outlined in Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women and peace and security, particularly the need for parties to armed conflict to adopt prevention and protection measures in order to end sexual violence. 10. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that some special groups of women are particularly vulnerable to violence, either because of their nationality, ethnicity, religion or language, or because they belong to an indigenous group, are migrants, are stateless, are refugees, live in underdeveloped, rural or remote communities, are homeless, are in institutions or in detention, have disabilities, are elderly, are widowed or live in conflict, post-conflict and disaster situations and as such they require special attention, intervention and protection in the development of crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women. 11. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize advances in crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women and the importance of investing in the prevention of violence against women. 12. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that States have the obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, including women, and that they must exercise due diligence and take relevant measures to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women, to eliminate impunity and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of women’s human rights and fundamental freedoms.

[Recalling decision 31/CMP.1; 2. [[The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) acknowledged that the potential impacts of response measures is a challenge faced by all countries.] [Parties noted that striving to minimize the adverse impacts of mitigation polices and measures is a common concern of both developed and developing countries.] [They further noted that any consideration of these impacts should [initially] focus on the poorest countries and those least able to address those impacts. ]] Alt: [Parties noted that striving to minimize the adverse impacts of mitigation policies and measures is an obligation of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) and a concern of developing countries and [emphasizing ][the SBI emphasized ]the commitment of Annex I Parties to minimize adverse social, environmental and economic impacts of response measures on developing country Parties, particularly those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention.] 3. [[Recognizing][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jrecognized] the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation[ and/or are faced with serious difficulties in switching to alternatives], as a consequence of action taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions. ] 4. [[Recognizing][The SBI recognized] that developing country Parties need to be given full consideration as they would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the Convention. ] 5. [[Considering][Recalling][The SBI [and the SBSTA Junderlined] the importance of the principles outlined in Article 3 of the Convention in the implementation of Article 3, paragraph 14, [and Article 2, paragraph 3, Jof the Kyoto Protocol.] 6. [Developed country Parties shall not resort to any form of unilateral measures including countervailing trade measures, against goods and services imported from developing countries on grounds of protection and stabilization of the climate. Such measures would violate the principles and provisions of the Convention, including, in particular, those related to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (Article 3, paragraph 1), to trade and climate change (Article 3, paragraph 5), and to the relationship between mitigation actions of developing countries and the provision of financial resources and technology by developed country Parties (Article 4, paragraphs 3 and 7).] Alt: [The SBI [and the SBSTA Junderlined the importance of Article 3 of the Convention in the implementation of Article 3, paragraph 14, and Article 2, paragraph 3, of the Kyoto Protocol. ] 52 FCCC/SBI/2010/10 Alt: [Parties, in the pursuit of the objective and implementation of the Convention, shall not resort to any measures, in particular unilateral fiscal or non-fiscal measures applied at the border against goods and services imported from Parties, that constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade, taking into account the relevant provisions of the Convention and further recognizing the principle enshrined in Article 3, paragraph 5.] 7. [The SBI [and the SBSTA Jacknowledged the work being carried out by other bodies under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol, with the aim of maintaining an approach that is coherent with other relevant work under the UNFCCC process. ] 8. [[Emphasizing][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jemphasized] that [developed country Parties [included in Annex I to the Convention]shall, in the implementation of policies and measures, strive to minimize the adverse effects, including the adverse effects of climate change, effects on international trade, and social, environmental and economic impacts on other Parties, especially developing country Parties, and in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention, taking into account its Article 3.] 9. [The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the need to deepen Parties’ understanding of adverse impacts and the need to continue to share information on the nature of impacts of response measures. Sharing of information can be achieved through the regular and systematic provision by all Parties of information that is as complete as possible on potential and observed impacts of policies and measures, in particular through [Annex I Jnational communications, and the regular review of this information.] Alt: [[Acknowledging][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted Jthe need to share information on the nature of adverse impacts of response measures experienced by developing country Parties and the steps Annex I Parties are taking, in the implementation of policies and measures under Article 2 of the Kyoto Protocol, to minimize adverse effects, especially on developing country Parties, in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention. ] Alt: [[Noting][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]]noted the importance of the exchange of information and the development of methodologies on the assessment of adverse social, environmental and economic impacts on developing country Parties, particularly those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention.] Option 1: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso noted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the adverse impacts of policies and measures, and that understanding of this could be achieved through: (a) | Assessments of potential impacts and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations; (b) Information from work being carried out by other UNFCCC bodies that may be relevant in considering potential impacts. Option 2: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the need to deepen the understanding of potential consequences of response measures taken by Annex I Parties on developing country Parties and that this can be achieved through various means including assessments of potential and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations. Option 3: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the potential impacts of response measures. The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso noted the need to deepen the understanding on the potential impacts of response measures to respond to climate change. This could be achieved through: 53 FCCC/SBI/2010/10 (a) | Assessments of potential impacts and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations; (b) Information from work being carried out by other UNFCCC bodies that may be relevant in considering potential impacts; (c) The regular and systematic provision by all Parties of information that is as complete as possible on potential and observed impacts of policies and measures, in particular through national communications, and the regular review of this information. 10. Concerned about the gaps in methodology to incorporate information on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures, in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1. 11. The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on international spillover effects as described in its Fourth Assessment Report, and [that the IPCC has decided][its plans] to further assess [this issue][and co-benefits and trade-offs] in its Fifth Assessment Report. 12. [The SBI [and the SBSTA Jinvited Parties and relevant organizations to submit to the secretariat, by xx, further information and views on issues relevant to Article 3, paragraph 14[, and Article 2, paragraph 3,] of the Kyoto Protocol, including views on whether a workshop should be held on this matter, and on the issues to be dealt with at any such workshop and to compile the submissions into a miscellaneous document. ] Alt: [[Invites ][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso invited] Annex I Parties to submit (by xx) information on the different ways used for reporting on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures, in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1 and [requests ][requested ]the secretariat to compile the information submitted above. ] 13. [Decides][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]decided ]Jto work on a road map for a phased approach to the implementation of Article 3, paragraph 14, of the Kyoto Protocol, to further its implementation and in accordance with decision 13/CMP.1, and to establish a common reporting methodology to incorporate information on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures, in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1. The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso decided that the common reporting methodology shall be guided by transparency, consistency, comparability, completeness and accuracy. 14. [Requests][The SBI [and the SBSTA Jrequested] the IPCC to develop guidelines to help determine if Parties included in Annex I to the Convention are striving to minimize adverse effects, including the adverse effects of climate change, effects on international trade, and social, environmental and economic impacts on other Parties, especially developing country Parties, and in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Convention. 15. [Decides][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]Jdecided] to consider what further actions are necessary to help developing country Parties, and in particular those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 and 9, of the Convention. Among the issues to be considered shall be the establishment of funding, insurance and transfer of technology, pursuant to Article 3, paragraph 14. 16.
