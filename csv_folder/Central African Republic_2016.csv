hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension, there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and that these problems could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Recognizing also the complex character of the global food crisis, in which the right to adequate food has been threatened to be violated on a substantial scale, as a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as natural disasters and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Resolved to act to ensure that the human rights perspective is taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to food, Stressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and nutrition availability, Stressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger

vulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up agroecological approaches, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and _ nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern also over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the enjoyment of the right to food, 3/11 Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and nutrition security and the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security '° by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth

cultural values of dietary and eating habits in different cultures, and recognizing that food plays an important role in defining the identity of individuals and communities and is a cultural component that describes and gives value to a territory and its inhabitants, Recognizing the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance

Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 795 million people in the world remain undernourished owing to the lack of sufficient food for the conduct of an active and healthy life, including as one of the effects derived from the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2015, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 5/11 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8.

Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; 10. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support for national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and promoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 11.

Also calls upon all States and, where appropriate, relevant international organizations to implement policies and programmes to reduce and eliminate preventable mortality and morbidity, as a result of malnutrition, of children under 5 years of age, and in this regard urges States to disseminate the technical guidance prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in collaboration with the World Health Organization’’ and to apply it, as appropriate, in the design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of laws, policies, programmes, budgets and mechanisms for remedy and redress aimed at eliminating preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5 years of age; 13. Encourages all States to take steps, with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the 6/11 conditions for everyone to be free from hunger and, as soon as possible, to enjoy fully the right to food, and to create and adopt national plans to combat hunger; 14. Recognizes the advances reached through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 15.

Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small- scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 19.

States to exercise due diligence to prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators of trafficking in persons and to protect and empower victims, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims, Seriously concerned that an increasing number of women and girls are being trafficked, including to developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States, and recognizing that trafficking in persons disproportionately affects women and girls and that men and boys are also victims of trafficking, including for sexual exploitation, Recognizing that certain efforts against trafficking in persons lack the gender and age sensitivity needed to effectively differentiate between and respond to the risks faced by women and girls, who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced marriage, forced labour, services and other forms of exploitation, thus highlighting the need to incorporate a gender- and age-sensitive approach into all anti-trafficking efforts, Recognizing also the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, in particular girls, Recognizing further that pervasive gender inequality, poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination and marginalization and persistent demand for trafficked women and girls are among the underlying causes that make women and girls vulnerable to trafficking, Recognizing the need to adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand, which fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to trafficking, Recognizing also the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations, including in conflict and post-conflict environments, natural disasters and other emergency environments, as well as the devastating consequences for women and girls in such circumstances, and noting in this regard the Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiative and the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change resulting from the Nansen Initiative, while recognizing that not all States are participating in them, Recognizing further the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of being trafficked and to help to identify victims of trafficking in persons, Recognizing that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls and to protecting and assisting the victims of human trafficking remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt and implement adequate legislation and other measures and to continue improving the 4/13 collection of reliable data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant factors and of statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls, Recognizing also that further work is required both to better understand the link between migration and trafficking in persons and to develop more effective responses to eliminate the risk of trafficking in the migration process in order to, inter alia, further efforts to protect women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse, Concerned about the use of new information and communications technologies, including the Internet, for purposes of recruiting for the exploitation of the prostitution of others, including for exploiting women and children and for child pornography, including sexual abuse material, paedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse of children, as well as for forced marriage and forced labour, while acknowledging the role that information and communications technologies play in reducing the risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, including by empowering women and children to report such abuses, Concerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of national laws and international standards, Noting with concern that women and girls are also vulnerable to the risk of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and in this regard taking note of Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 25/1, entitled “Preventing and combating trafficking in human organs and trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal”,’” adopted by the Commission at its twenty-fifth session, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Noting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, exploitative labour and the illegal removal of organs is met by trafficking in persons, and recognizing that human trafficking is fuelled by high profits for traffickers and demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, owing to pervasive and persistent gender inequality, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of the violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness, See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2016, Supplement No. 10

Resolution 70/1. 2/7 Noting with concern that poverty, insecurity and lack of education are among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Noting with concern also that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and also that the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, as well as their meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that raising awareness of the harmful consequences of child, early and forced marriage, including among men and boys, can contribute to promoting social norms that support efforts by girls and their families to end this harmful practice, Recognizing further men and boys as strategic partners and allies and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and recognizing that educational opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced 3/7 displacement, armed conflict and natural disaster and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, 1.

the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund, the International Labour Organization, the International Organization for Migration and other relevant United Nations entities, agencies and programmes, and noting the endorsement by the World Health Assembly of the global plan of action to

the name of passion, practices harmful to women and girls such as child, early and forced marriage, forced sterilization, forced abortion, coercive/forced use of contraception, forced pregnancy,

relations between men and women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major impediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, the economy and political decision-making, Recognizing that women’s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and from the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, impedes the social and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed development goals, Acknowledging the need to address violence against women and girls holistically, including through the recognition of linkages between

girls and women and girls with disabilities, and stressing the urgent need to address violence and discrimination against them, 3/12 Recognizing also that the persistence of armed conflicts in various parts of the world is a major impediment to the elimination of all forms of violence against women, and bearing in mind that armed conflict and other types of armed violence, including terrorism and hostage-taking, still persist in many parts of the world and that aggression, foreign occupation and ethnic and other types of conflicts are an ongoing reality affecting women and men in nearly every region, that States and the international community should place particular focus on the plight, and give priority attention and increased assistance to relieve the suffering of women and girls living in such situations and to ensure that, where violence is committed against them, all perpetrators of such violence are duly investigated and, as appropriate, prosecuted and punished in order to end impunity, while stressing the need to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law, Recognizing further that rape and other forms of sexual violence in armed conflict can constitute war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949'* and Additional Protocol I thereto,’” that perpetrators of such violence must be held accountable and that there must be no impunity in this regard, Acknowledging that trafficking in persons is one of the forms of transnational organized crime which exposes women and girls to violence, including domestic violence, and that concerted

Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,'° as well as the full and effective implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons,'’ will contribute to the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, Gravely concerned about the unprecedented number of refugees

domestic violence, trafficking in persons and contemporary forms of slavery, Gravely concerned also that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, remains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all social strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse or impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, as such, is unacceptable, Recognizing the serious immediate and long-term implications for physical and psychological health, including sexual and reproductive health, and the effects that domestic violence against women and girls can present for individuals and families across generations, 4 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 75, Nos. 970-973. © Tbid., vol. 1125, No.

voting and holding public office, resulting in an impediment to women’s empowerment and economic independence, Underscoring the fact that shame, stigma, fear of reprisals and negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced household income, prevent many women and girls from leaving abusive relationships, reporting or acting as witnesses in cases of domestic violence and seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Deeply concerned about the high level of impunity with regard to gender- related killing of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the world, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to gender-related killing of women and girls, including in ending impunity for such crimes, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage places individuals, in particular girls, at risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, including domestic violence, throughout their lives and constitutes a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, while increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, and that every girl and woman at risk of or affected by child, early and forced marriage must have equal access to affordable quality services such as education, counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services, medical care and legal assistance, Reaffirming that female genital mutilation is a harmful practice and an act of violence against women and girls that impairs their human rights, constituting a serious threat to their health and well-being, including their psychological, sexual and reproductive health, increasing their vulnerability to HIV and possibly having adverse obstetric and prenatal outcomes, as well as fatal consequences for the mother and the newborn, and that the abandonment of this harmful practice can be achieved as a result of a comprehensive movement that involves all public and private stakeholders in society, including girls, boys, women and men, Emphasizing that States should continue to adopt and implement legislation and policies in accordance with their obligations under international law, and in particular in accordance with relevant international human rights obligations and with their commitments, which address the issue of violence against women and girls in a comprehensive manner, not only by criminalizing violence against women and girls, providing for the prosecution of perpetrators and holding them accountable, but also by including protection and preventive measures and access to just and effective remedies for victims and survivors, with provisions for adequate funding for their implementation, Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to 5/12 account the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, Welcoming the major contributions made by civil society, including women’s and community-based organizations, feminist groups, women human rights defenders, girls’ and youth-led organizations, national human rights institutions where they exist, religious leaders, faith-based organizations, organizations active in the family field, the private sector, employer organizations, trade unions, the media, and by men and boys, in the efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and recognizing the

and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such violence the family can play an important role, 1. Calls upon all States to implement the commitment to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; '* 2. Stresses that “violence against women” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, including online, and notes the economic and social harm caused by such violence; 3.

Urges States to condemn violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and reaffirms that they should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination and should pursue, by all appropriate means and without delay, a policy of eliminating violence against women as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women;* 8. Stresses that, despite the important steps taken by many countries around the world, States should continue to focus on the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls, as well as on their protection, their empowerment and the provision of services, and should therefore implement laws, policies and programmes for ending all forms of violence against women and girls and monitor and rigorously evaluate their implementation and improve, where possible, their impact, accessibility and effectiveness; 9. Also stresses the importance of ensuring that, in armed conflict and post- conflict situations and in natural disaster situations, the prevention of and response to all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, are prioritized and effectively addressed, including, as appropriate, through the investigation, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators to end impunity, the removal of barriers to women’s access to justice, the establishment of complaint and reporting mechanisms and the provision of support to victims and survivors; 10. Further stresses the need to leave no one behind in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in this regard recognizes the challenges faced by refugee and migrant women and girls and the need to protect and empower them, including in countries in conflict and post-conflict situations, and the need to strengthen the resilience of communities hosting refugees, and underscores the importance of development support for those communities, particularly in developing countries; 11.
