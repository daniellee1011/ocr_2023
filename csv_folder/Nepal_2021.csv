likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impact of global

obligations with regard to human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, the empowerment of women and intergenerational equity, Noting the Secretary-General’s Call to Action for Human Rights, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Taking note of the outcomes of the twenty-fifth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and encouraging States to consider, among other aspects, respect for and the promotion of human rights at the twenty-sixth session, to be held in Glasgow, United Kingdom

patterns of discrimination, and that environmental harm can have disastrous and at times geographically dispersed consequences for the quality of life of indigenous peoples, local communities, peasants and others who rely directly on the products of forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans for their food, fuel and medicine, resulting in further inequality and marginalization, Recognizing also that sustainable development and the protection of the environment, including ecosystems, contribute to human well-being and to the enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, to an adequate standard of living, to adequate food, to safe drinking water and sanitation and to housing, and cultural rights, Recognizing further that, conversely, the impact of climate change, the unsustainable management and use of natural resources, the pollution of air, land and water, the unsound management of chemicals and waste, the resulting loss of biodiversity and the decline in services provided by ecosystems may interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing that, while the human rights implications of environmental damage are felt by individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, as well as women and girls, Recalling the importance of women’s and indigenous peoples’ rights to have access to and to use land to increase opportunities for climate change adaption and mitigation, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Special Report on Climate Change and Land, Recognizing the benefits of seeking to mitigate and minimize the negative effects of pollution and other forms of environmental degradation in situations of armed conflict and A/HRC/46/L.6/Rev.1 post-conflict contexts, and expressing its deep concern at the threats posed to the effective enjoyment of human rights by persons in vulnerable situations, including children, women and girls, youth, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous peoples, local communities, refugees, internally displaced persons and migrants, Recognizing also that the exercise of human rights, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, to participate effectively in the conduct of government and public affairs and the right to an effective remedy, is vital to the protection of a clean, healthy, safe and sustainable environment, Reaffirming Human Rights Council resolution 40/11 of 21 March 2019, in which the Council recognized the contribution of human rights defenders working in environmental matters, referred to as environmental human rights defenders, to the enjoyment of human rights, environmental protection and sustainable development, urges all States to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of the rights and safety of all persons, including environmental human rights defenders, and underscores the responsibility of all business enterprises, both transnational and others, in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, to respect human rights, including the rights to life, liberty and security of human rights defenders, including environmental human rights defenders, Noting the World Health Organization “Manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19”, which aims at creating a healthier, fairer and more sustainable world while investing to maintain and resuscitate economies hit by the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and welcoming the work of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment in engaging and consulting with children, Recognizing also the importance of gender equality, gender-responsive action to address climate change and environmental degradation, the empowerment, leadership, decision-making and meaningful participation of women and girls, and the role women play as managers, leaders and defenders of natural resources and agents of change in safeguarding the environment, Recognizing further the particular vulnerability of children to the effects of environmental harm, including to air pollution, water pollution, climate change, exposure to chemicals, toxic substances and waste, and loss of biodiversity, and that environmental harm may interfere with the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, Mindful that the growing risk of emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin may be caused by human actions that damage ecosystems and biodiversity, stressing that biodiversity is important for the enjoyment of a wide range of human rights, and expressing concern that the loss of biodiversity caused by human activities can be threatening to the enjoyment of those rights and have a major impact on health and livelihoods, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and promote human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental challenges, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, as recognized in different international instruments and reflected in the framework principles on human rights and the environment,? and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to environmental harm should be taken, Noting that more than 155 States have recognized some form of a right to a healthy environment in, inter alia, international agreements or their national constitutions, legislation or policies, 1.

contained therein, particularly, Goal 4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, its specific and interlinked targets, and other education-related Goals and targets, and recalling the importance of education for reaching all Sustainable Development Goals, Reaffirming further Human Rights Council resolution 8/4 of 18 June 2008, and recalling all other resolutions of the Council on the right to education, the most recent of which is resolution 44/3 of 16 July 2020, and also the resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on the subject, Bearing in mind the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training and the World Programme for Human Rights Education, which both underline the importance of human rights education as an integral part of the right to education, GE.21-09154(E) A/HRC/47/L.4 Expressing concern that, in spite of the progress achieved in the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 4, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, there are still 773 million adults who are not literate, two thirds of whom are women, and 258 million children, adolescents and youth who do not attend school, and that, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund, 50 per cent of pre- primary-age children around the world — at least 175 million — are not enrolled in pre-primary education, Recalling the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030 — towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, adopted at the World Education Forum 2015, held in Incheon, Republic of Korea, which aims to mobilize all countries and partners and provide guidance on achieving the effective implementation of Sustainable

especially economic and technical, to the maximum of available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights by all appropriate means, in particular the adoption of legislative measures, Expressing deep concern about the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the right to education for all, taking into account that more than 1.5 billion learners have been affected by the closure of educational institutions worldwide, Expressing concern also that, despite the tremendous efforts made by States and other stakeholders, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected those in the most vulnerable and marginalized situations, including in particular girls and women, persons with disabilities, persons living in poverty, migrants, asylum seekers, refugees, stateless and internally displaced persons and students in developing countries, and has exposed and exacerbated the entrenched structural inequalities in the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education, Reiterating the importance of early childhood development as a valuable foundation of lifelong learning and the entire education system, and the need to invest in early childhood education and care, Strongly condemning the recurring attacks on students, teachers, schools and universities, and the military use of educational facilities, which impair the realization of the right to education and cause severe and long-lasting harm to individuals and societies, Recognizing the negative impact of climate change, natural disasters, conflict and crisis on the full realization of the right to education, the fact that a large proportion of the world’s out-of-school population lives in conflict-affected areas, and that crises, violence and attacks on and the military use of educational institutions, natural disasters and pandemics continue to disrupt education and development globally, Recognizing also that girls are disproportionately represented among out-of-school children and that women are disproportionately represented among illiterate adults owing to, inter alia, gender-based discrimination and violence, including sexual violence and harassment; lack of a safe learning environment; child, early or forced marriage or unplanned pregnancy; the lack of appropriate water and sanitation facilities and menstrual health and hygiene supplies; discriminatory laws; gender stereotypes; patriarchal social norms; lack of empowerment, including on economic grounds, especially when education is not free; and discrimination based on any other grounds, such as race, colour, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, migration or other status, A/HRC/47/L.4 Recognizing further the role that access to information and communications technology, including the Internet, plays in facilitating the realization of the right to education and in promoting inclusive quality education, in particular in situations of emergencies, and recalling its important role during the COVID-19 pandemic, when on-site education has had to be suspended, Expressing concern at the inequalities in access to information and communications technology, which have increased the digital divides and expanded technological gaps, including but not limited to those based on gender, age, disability and migration or refugee status, and with their negative impact on the realization of the right to education, Stressing in this respect that the incorporation of digital technologies in education, notwithstanding its potential to expand and complement access to education, is not a long- term replacement for on-site schooling, and the need for a thorough debate on the role of digital technologies in education, keeping in mind not only equality of opportunities, including for conflict-affected areas, but also its potential unintended negative effects, including on children’s and young persons’ health, education and interpersonal development, the changes it may create in the organization of education systems and the potential to serve as an equalizer for marginalized children and young persons, Reaffirming that the human rights principles of non-discrimination and equality are central to the full realization of the right to education as enshrined in the Convention against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and emphasizing that everyone is entitled to the right to education without discrimination of any kind, Noting that education systems should nurture cultural diversity with a view to protecting cultural rights and fostering mutual understanding, respect for diversity and tolerance, Welcoming the steps taken to fully realize the right to education, such as the enactment of appropriate legislation, adjudication by national courts, the development of national indicators, and ensuring justiciability of this right, and aware of the role that communications procedures at the regional and international levels can play in promoting the justiciability of the right to education, Noting the development by experts of guiding principles and tools for States, such as the Abidjan
