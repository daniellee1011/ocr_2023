2005,Economic And Social Council,Commission On Human Rights,Sixty-first session,18,EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS,"Bangladesh*, Belarus*, Bhutan, Burundi*, Cameroon*, China, Congo, Céte d’Ivoire*, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador*, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of)*, Kenya, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya*, Malaysia, Mauritania, Myanmar*, Nepal, Nigeria, Oman*, Pakistan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal*, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic*, Togo, Tunisia*, United Republic of Tanzania*, Uruguay*, Venezuela*, Viet Nam*, Yemen*, Zambia* and Zimbabwe",2005,Composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,"The Commission on Human Rights, Recalling that, in its report to the Special Commission of the Economic and Social Council (E/CN.4/1988/85 and Corr.1), the Commission reaffirmed that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level was the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity and was convinced that this objective was compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution and took into account Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, Recalling also Part 11, paragraphs 11 and 17, of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.157/23), in which the World Conference on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General and the General Assembly to provide sufficient human, financial and other resources to the Centre for Human Rights to enable it effectively, efficiently and expeditiously to carry out its activities, while recognizing the necessity for restructuring United Nations human rights machinery, in accordance with its real needs, Reaffirming the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as of different political, economic and legal systems, Recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally and that genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and international understanding, Taking into account the need to pay particular attention to the recruitment of personnel for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States, particularly from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, thus improving the present staff composition, based on a more equitable geographical distribution, Reiterating its deep concern that the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/109) concerning the geographical composition and the functions of the Office staff clearly reflects that one region is unequivocally overrepresented in the staff composition and that the imbalance still remains (see the annexes to the present resolution), Expressing again its concern over the non-representation and underrepresentation of several Member States, especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition, on the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, many of them also non-represented or underrepresented at the level of the whole Secretariat, particularly bearing in mind the criteria of equitable geographical distribution, Expressing its concern also that the prevalence of project personnel has skewed the geographical distribution of the staff of the Office towards Western Europe and North America, compared to the Secretariat-wide pattern, as has the geographical distribution of consultants, Noting with grave concern that the dependency of the Office on extrabudgetary resources is at the heart of the imbalance in the composition of its staff, 1. Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures proposed or implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation for the last few years; 2. Welcomes the fact that the High Commissioner recently submitted a comprehensive proposal to the Office of Human Resources Management that will effectively discontinue the practice of hiring temporary staff for regular functions of the Office of the High Commissioner through the regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field to align the recruitment policy of the Office with that of the United Nations Secretariat; 3. Regrets that most of the measures described therein are not new and, as the statistics show, they are either inadequate or inadequately or insufficiently applied and they have failed to produce any concrete improvement in the geographical distribution of the staff of the Office to date, and that the report does not provide for specific targets and deadlines to be achieved in order to reduce the current imbalance in the staff, as requested in paragraph 23 (a) of Commission resolution 2004/73; 4. Expresses its concern that, while nationals of 30 out of 43 developed countries are represented in the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the overwhelming majority of developing countries, 102 out of 148, have not a single national on the staff of the Office, despite the fact that 13 out of 15 unrepresented countries and 6 out of the 5. Also expresses its concern that the number of nationals of most of the developed countries overrepresented, underrepresented or within range at the level of the whole Secretariat outnumber by many times the average number of nationals of individual developing countries represented on the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 6. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 7. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU/REP/2003/6) that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner; 8. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than in those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 9. Takes note with appreciation that the recommendations for the selection of staff for technical cooperation activities and advisory services will be subject to the review of the Office’s internal Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues and that the composition of the Panel has been reviewed to balance its geographical distribution, as requested by Commission resolution 2004/73, and requests the High Commissioner to ensure that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general and to report to the Commission on the current composition of the Panel; 10. Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from unrepresented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive 10. examinations; 11. Welcomes the statement in the report that the Office of the High Commissioner has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts, involving the screening of candidates at the initial recruitment stage, including of short-term staff, to ensure that, between equally qualified candidates, priority is given to candidates from such countries, but regrets that in the last year there has been a further increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from one regional group, enlarging the existing chronic geographical imbalance, and requests the High Commissioner to use the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 11. 12. Also welcomes the assurance of the High Commissioner that she attaches the utmost importance to equitable geographical representation, as well as to the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity on the part of the staff of her Office and the fact that the High Commissioner has paid particular attention to geographical diversity in the recruitment of the senior managers, since four out of seven posts subject to geographical distribution at the D-1 level and above are encumbered by staff from developing countries; 12. 13. Expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 13. discontinued; 14. Stresses that the proposal made in the last year by the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and is, therefore, unacceptable; 14. 15. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, 15. furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office at Geneva; 16. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 17. Also reiterates that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 17. 18. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 18. 19. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 19. 20. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 20. 21. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 21. 22. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 22. 23. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 23. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 24. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of her mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 24. 25. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 25. Requests the High Commissioner: 26. (a) To ensure that the one-time post regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field results in a new and balanced geographical distribution of the staff of the Office, advertising the posts to be regularized and filling them in a transparent and competitive manner, following United Nations practices and provisions; (b) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (c) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; (d) To use also the programmes and funds for technical cooperation and human rights education for the training of national technical personnel in developing countries and countries with economies in transition through the use of Junior Professional Officers from these countries, with a view to guaranteeing that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers and that every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; (e) To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-second session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 27. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 28. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights”, in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 28. 29.

Considers it intolerable that every five seconds a child under the age of 5 dies from hunger or hunger-related diseases somewhere in the world, that there are about 854 million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years when, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 5. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 6.

Stresses also the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands; and in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 10. Acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 11. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 12.

Recognizes the need for a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round negotiations of the World Trade Organization, as a contribution for creating international conditions that permit the realization of the right to food; 14.

Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites once again all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security’ and the United Nations Millennium Declaration;’ 16. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 17. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, A/C.3/61/L.27 while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 19. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently occurring across Africa; 20.

Recalls General Comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant),!! in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture in realization of the right to adequate food; 26.
