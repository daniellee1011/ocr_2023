Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Morocco, Namibia, Netherlands, Portugal, Russian Federation, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe",N/A,The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts,"The General Assembly, Recognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds is a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in, and proliferation of, armaments, especially small arms and light weapons, Also recognizing the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts, Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security, Recognizing therefore that urgent action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, Also recognizing the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for urgent international action to prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a critical contribution to the economies of many of the producing, exporting and importing States, especially developing States, Noting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from legitimate sources, Recalling all the resolutions related to conflict diamonds of the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter, and determined to contribute to and support the implementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions, Also recalling its resolution 55/56 of 1 December 2000, in which it called upon the international community to develop detailed proposals for a simple and workable international certification scheme for rough diamonds based primarily on national certification schemes and on internationally agreed minimum standards, Believing that the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict can be substantially reduced by introducing an international certification scheme for rough diamonds and that such a scheme would help protect legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on trade in conflict diamonds, Emphasizing that the envisaged international certification scheme for rough diamonds should be simple, effective and pragmatic, should not impede the present legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and should not hinder the development of the diamond industry, Acknowledging the important initiatives already taken to address the problem of conflict diamonds, in particular by the Governments of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea and Sierra Leone and by other key producing, exporting and importing countries, and encouraging those Governments to continue the initiatives, Also acknowledging the continued efforts of regional organizations and other groups of countries to curb conflict diamonds, Welcoming the important contribution made by the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council, as well as civil society, to assist international efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds, Also welcoming voluntary self-regulation initiatives for the diamond industry announced by the World Diamond Council, and recognizing that a system of such voluntary self-regulation will contribute to ensuring the effectiveness of national systems of internal controls for rough diamonds, Recognizing that an international certification scheme for rough diamonds will only be credible if all participants have established internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices as well as differences in institutional controls thereof may require different approaches to meet minimum standards, Welcoming the important contribution made by the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African producing countries towards developing proposals for the envisaged international certification scheme, A/56/L.72 Noting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis, involving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing States, the diamond industry and civil society, Recognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and the principles of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to, 1. Notes with appreciation the report on the Kimberley Processtubmitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55/56, and congratulates the participants in the Kimberley Process on their achievements thus far; 2. Recognizes that the proposed international certification scheme for rough diamonds would also help to ensure the effective implementation of relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on the trade in conflict diamonds, and calls for the full implementation of existing Security Council measures targeting the illicit trade in rough diamonds that play a role in fuelling conflict; 3. Welcomes the detailed proposals for an international certification scheme for rough diamonds developed in the Kimberley Process and presented in the form of Kimberley Process working document 9/2001 (as amended), entitled “Essential elements of an international scheme of certification for rough diamonds, with a view to breaking the link hetween armed conflict and the trade in rough diamonds”, dated 29 November 2001,% which provide a good basis for the proposed certification scheme; 4. Encourages the Kimberley Process to resolve outstanding issues; 5. Emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the measures taken to implement the international certification scheme for rough diamonds are consistent with international law governing international trade; 6. Urges the finalization of the international certification scheme, and its subsequent implementation, as soon as possible, recognizing the urgency of the situation from a humanitarian and security standpoint; 7. Underlines the need, as an essential tool for the successful implementation of the proposed international certification scheme, for the collation and dissemination of relevant statistical data on the production of, and international trade in, rough diamonds; 8. Supports the extension of the work of the Kimberley Process until such time as an international certification scheme is adopted and its simultancous implementation by participants begins; 9. Urges Member States to participate actively in the proposed international certification scheme, and stresses that the widest possible participation in the proposed international certification scheme is essential and should be encouraged and facilitated; 10. Welcomes the offer by the Government of Canada to host the next meeting of the Kimberley Process in Ottawa, in order to achieve further progress; 1 See A/56/502, A/56/675 and A/56/775. 2 See A/56/775, annex VIII.
