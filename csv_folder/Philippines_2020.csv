addressing food security challenges must be nationally articulated, designed, owned and led, and built on consultation with all key stakeholders, and recognizing the commitment to strengthening the multilateral system in the channelling of resources and in the promotion of policies dedicated to fighting hunger and malnutrition, Recognizing the complex character of food insecurity and its likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impact of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, excessive volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, including land-locked developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of human-made and natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have, in combination with other factors, resulted in substantial loss of life

As an outcome, the actions taken by the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization contribute to the achievement of broader global targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals; the global forest goals; nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; the Aichi Biodiversity Targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity; the land degradation neutrality targets of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; and the Bonn Challenge. Response to the efforts of global community in the forest sector 11. As noted in the background study prepared for the fourteenth session of the United Nations Forum on Forests, forests are the second largest storehouses of carbon, absorbing and storing about 30 per cent of current levels of carbon emissions in their biomass, soil and wood, and have the potential to store much more. However, forests also account for greenhouse gas emissions as a result of deforestation caused 4/21 A/75/192 by forest fires, diseases and pests. By mainly focusing on the forest sector, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization has unique strengths and potential as an intergovernmental organization, since its member counties are in the Asian region, which includes diverse landscapes, ranging from glaciated high mountains and drylands to one of the world’s largest tropical forests. 12. As identified in its strategic plan, the priority intervention areas of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization are in keeping with efforts by the global community to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It implements activities directly linked to the global forest goals set out in the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030 and translates them into actions on the ground in the Asian region. Reflecting the needs of its member countries, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization implements projects that protect and restore degraded forests and increases the involvement of local communities in forest-related activities in order to improve their livelihoods and help them to practice sustainable forest management. 13. The Asian Forest Cooperation Organization also implements biodiversity conservation projects, including activities for ecosystem services and for the conservation of genetic resources. It further aims to contribute to global biodiversity goals by taking account of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. VI. Programmes and projects 14. Since 2011, under the partnership between ASEAN and the Republic of Korea in the forest sector, the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization has embarked on many capacity-building programmes, subregional projects and individual country-driven projects. Nearly $32 million has been contributed to areas ranging from policy support interventions to engaging villagers in forest restoration and rehabilitation activities. The objectives of (a) capacity-building programmes; (b) seven subregional projects; and (c) three projects in individual countries, all of which primarily contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 15, are highlighted below: (a) Capacity-building programmes 15.

collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation-related services in line with Sustainable Development Goal 6 and taking note of its outcome document of 14 March 2018, Noting also the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2019 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report of the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2019, 1.6 billion people gained access to safe drinking water between 2000 and 2017 and that an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 785 million people lack a basic water service, 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.2 billion people lack access to a safely managed sanitation service and 673 million people still practise open defecation, Deeply alarmed about the fact that, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, scarcity of water could displace an estimated 700 million people by 2030, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and A/HRC/45/L.28 Hygiene has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms by which to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Recognizing that sustained access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities is essential to preventing infectious diseases and that people without or with inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are at a much higher risk of contracting and passing on diseases, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities and that those most at risk are persons in vulnerable and marginalized situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, and gravely concerned that 3 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home, which is the most effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable and marginalized situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island developing States and the least developed countries, rural and local communities and people facing desertification, land degradation, drought and water scarcity, as well as rising water levels due to storm surges, sea level rise and flooding, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water, when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or when, in the absence of adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, which limits their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, A/HRC/45/L.28 Deeply concerned also that persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities, as such facilities are often inaccessible and inappropriate for meeting their needs, which affects their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is further exacerbated in particular in the situation of homelessness, in informal settlements and in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed that water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or during natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability, and reaffirming also the importance of taking steps with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, tenure status, income levels or other related considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of achieving universal access to safe, affordable and adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030 and of adequate and new sources of funding, including innovative financing, Stressing also the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have sustained access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and takes note with appreciation of his reports; 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and_ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the A/HRC/45/L.28 relevant Sustainable Development Goals; urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach that includes menstrual health management when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;_and invites regional and international organizations to complement the efforts made by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in accordance with their respective mandates; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons in vulnerable situations have equal access to effective remedies; 6. Notes with concern that, in spite of all efforts, gender inequalities still exist in the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in particular as a result of women’s and girls’ specific needs concerning menstrual hygiene and menstrual health; 7. Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law; (b) To consider making the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, a priority at the highest level in order to ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability; (c) To increase public funding and support private capital in order to make adequate funding available to the sector and to close the financing gap that hampers the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 and the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; (d) To monitor continuously and analyse regularly the status of the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, to enhance efforts to improve the availability, accessibility, quality and use of water-related data at local, national and regional levels and to develop disaggregated and gender-responsive indicators and monitoring mechanisms; (e) | To promote both women’s leadership and the full, effective, meaningful and equal participation of women in planning, decision-making and implementation on water and sanitation management; to ensure that a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes and that measures are taken to reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education; to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside of their home or practising open defecation; to protect women’s and girls’ equal access to water and sanitation; and to take positive measures to guarantee the availability and accessibility of these rights; (f) To promote safe public spaces and improve the security and safety of all women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and infrastructure when accessing sanitation facilities and water waste collection and treatment facilities outside their homes or when collecting household water; A/HRC/45/L.28 (g) | To enhance international solidarity, cooperation and support for countries hosting large numbers of displaced persons and refugees to address their water- and sanitation-related challenges; (h) To address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by ensuring access to factual information thereon, addressing the negative social norms around the issue in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender- sensitive facilities, including options for the disposal and waste management of menstrual hygiene products, while recognizing that women’s and girls’ attendance at school, university or, for women, work, can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, public places and, for women, the workplace; (i) To take steps to promote action to raise international awareness on the issue of waterborne diseases and to mitigate the disproportionate impact of water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases on children and reduce child mortality, morbidity and stunting by ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and by engaging in partnerships with stakeholders to implement projects aimed at scaling up access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in developing countries; Gj) To take measures to accelerate the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in line with the Sustainable Development Goal 6 global acceleration framework, in particular in the context of responding to and preventing the spread of COVID-19, including by working collaboratively with all stakeholders in a coordinated manner to improve water and sanitation services and by ensuring that water and sanitation systems are resilient and sustainable in order to protect people’s health and support national health systems; (k) | To step up disease prevention efforts by ensuring access to safe, adequate and affordable water and sanitation services for all in public and private spaces; (1) To apply broad and inclusive participatory approaches, consulting and coordinating with local communities and other stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable and non-discriminatory access to adequate water and sanitation services; (m) To provide for effective mechanisms, such as regulation and accountability mechanisms, to ensure that all stakeholders respect and promote human rights and avoid causing or contributing to human rights violations or abuses;

sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights, and resolution 74/141 of 18 December 2019, Reaffirming all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, Council resolution 39/8 of 27 September 2018, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Recalling also that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to the right to life and human dignity, Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that human GE.20-12836(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 rights must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with

September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which States pledged to leave no one behind, Recalling that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development covers the issue of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also that 10 years after the recognition of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, integrated approaches that support the practical realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, particularly by tackling inequalities and ensuring special attention to the needs and rights of all women and girls, are more pertinent than ever before, also in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the need to pursue these integrated approaches to the implementation of Goal 6 and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals that reflect the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and

Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, A/HRC/45/L.48 Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, or primary caregivers and legal guardians, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, A/HRC/45/L.48 Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1.

particular the work of the Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Reaffirming that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, that the best interests of the child shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his or her nurture and protection, and that families’ and caregivers’ capacities to provide the child with care and a safe environment should be promoted, including in the context of natural disasters, the adverse impacts of climate change or other forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1.

international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and

including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive

where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, 4/10 AIC.3/75/L.9 Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,!* and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high-quality, accessible, timely and reliable data to measure progress in the implementation of the Goals for persons with disabilities, 1.

'2 Resolution 68/3. 2/10 the persistent gaps in this regard, and identifies good practices and recommended actions in accessibility for the effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the disability-inclusive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Welcoming progress towards mainstreaming disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in the work of the United Nations, and noting with appreciation the launch of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and the leadership of the Secretary-General to bring about transformative and systematic change on disability inclusion across the United Nations system, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters, Recognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, and that persons with disabilities and their families should receive social protection and assistance to enable the family and its members to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with disabilities, Recognizing further the collective responsibility

application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Concerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to obtain health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, a lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, 3/10 Recognizing that persons with disabilities are directly and _ indirectly disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated existing inequalities, discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion and increased the risk of unemployment and poverty, as well as of violence and abuse, in particular against women and girls with disabilities, recognizing also that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as face barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may have higher rates of underlying risk factors, and have a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 disease, developing severe health conditions or being fatally affected by it, Reaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Taking note of the initiatives that the Secretary-General, United Nations agencies and United Nations entities have undertaken in order to promote disability inclusion in COVID-19 response and recovery efforts as a vital step towards achieving the pledge to leave no one behind, and noting in this regard the importance of promoting equal access of persons with disabilities to social services, quality education and health care, full and productive employment and decent work, encouraging their effective and meaningful participation, protecting their human rights, eliminating discrimination against them, and systematically collecting and using data disaggregated by sex, age and disability, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, Recognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities into development policies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, meaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development 4/10 programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,!* and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high- 3 Such as the Guidelines and Principles for the Development of Disability Statistics (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.01.XVII.15) and the Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.07.XVIL.8). 5/10 quality, accessible, timely and reliable data to measure progress in the implementation of the Goals for persons with disabilities, 1.

Requests the Secretary-General to establish and administer a trust fund for the Judicial Fellowship Programme of the International Court of Justice, in accordance with the terms of reference as set out in the annex to the present resolution, through which States, international financial institutions, donor agencies, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and natural and juridical persons can make voluntary financial contributions in support of the Programme; 2.

Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session on the implementation of the present resolution. 2/7 Annex Terms of reference of the trust fund for the Judicial Fellowship Programme of the International Court of Justice I. Establishment 1. The trust fund for the Judicial Fellowship Programme of the International Court of Justice is established by the Secretary-General at the request of the General Assembly. II. Background 2. The International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It functions in accordance with its Statute which is annexed to the Charter of the United Nations. The seat of the Court is at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands. 3. The Court’s role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by United Nations organs in accordance with the Charter and by specialized agencies authorized to do so. The Court is composed of 15 judges, who are elected for terms of office of nine years by the General Assembly and the Security Council. It is assisted by the Registry, its administrative organ. Its official languages are English and French. 4. The Court has always had a special interest in engaging young people in its judicial activities. The Court has continuously emphasized in its annual reports to the General Assembly, especially since 2012, the importance of enabling students from a wide range of geographic and linguistic backgrounds to familiarize themselves with the work of the Court and develop their skills in the field of the peaceful settlement of international disputes through the law. This long-standing interest of the Court is in line with several Assembly resolutions in which States, international organizations and institutions are encouraged to increase their activities to promote the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, in particular those activities which are of special benefit to persons from developing countries. ! 5. Unfortunately, there is no line in the budget of the Court which allows it to fund temporary stays of recent law graduates at the Court to gain working experience. The Court was therefore greatly pleased when in 1999 the New York University School of Law offered to provide fellowship awards to five of its students per year to serve as university trainees at the Court and to enable these law graduates to gain experience working under the supervision of a member of the Court. The Court accepted this offer and established a University Traineeship Programme for this purpose. Under the terms of the agreement between the Court and New York University, the University was responsible for providing a monthly fellowship award to the selected candidates for the 10-month duration of their training at the Court. 6. In the following years, the Court sought to expand the University Traineeship Programme to other universities. Therefore, the Court invited other universities to nominate candidates to the Programme. Thanks to these efforts, between 2002 and 2015, a number of universities joined and started to nominate candidates for the ' See, for example, the twelfth preambular paragraph of resolution 74/185 on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law. 3/7 Programme. To enlarge even further the number of participating universities, participation in the Programme was opened in 2015 to all universities with law faculties, which have been invited every year since 2016 to nominate candidates through a call for applications posted on the website of the Court. 7. In 2017, the Court changed the name of the University Traineeship Programme to that of “Judicial Fellowship Programme” to reflect more accurately the nature of the activities in which the fellows are required to participate at the Court. Nonetheless, the Judicial Fellowship Programme retained the key features of the University Traineeship Programme. 8. The Judicial Fellowship Programme is an apprenticeship programme which enables recent law graduates to develop their skills in the field of the peaceful settlement of international disputes through the law. It aims to improve participants’ understanding of international law and the Court’s procedures by actively involving them in the work of the Court. Each fellow is assigned to one judge for a period of around 10 months, from early September to June or July of the following year. During this period, participants attend public hearings of the Court, research and write memorandums on legal questions or factual aspects of pending cases and are involved in other aspects of the Court’s work. Each participant works alongside an associate legal officer, who is the primary legal assistant of a judge and is employed by the United Nations. 9. The Court accepts up to 15 fellows a year, with no more than one from each nominating university. The Court looks for candidates who have achieved excellent results in their law studies and who have demonstrated an interest in international law through their studies or publications. Candidates are usually in the early stages of their legal careers. In making its selection, the Court seeks to choose candidates of various nationalities. 10. To date, all candidates have been nominated and sponsored by their respective universities, which undertake to fund the stipend, health insurance and travel costs of the candidate, if selected. 11. Over the years, it has become clear to the Court that the fact that participating universities are expected to provide a stipend to the students they nominate has tended to exclude less-endowed universities, particularly those based in developing countries, from nominating candidates, thus limiting the possibility for the Court to select fellows from a number of geographical regions. As a result, otherwise eligible students, who do not attend well-endowed universities based in developed countries, do not have the opportunity to participate in the Programme. 12. From 2000 to 2019, a total of 193 fellows participated in the Programme; 95 per cent were sponsored by universities based in countries of the Group of Western European and other States. During the same period, no fellows were sponsored by universities in Africa and Eastern Europe. Only one fellow (0.5 per cent) was sponsored by a university in Latin America and the Caribbean, and eight fellows (4 per cent) were sponsored by universities in the Asia Pacific region. Of the 193 fellows, the overwhelming majority (68 per cent) were nationals of countries of the Group of Western European and other States. Only 11 fellows (5 per cent) were nationals of Eastern European countries, 13 (6 per cent) of African countries, 17 (8 per cent) of Latin American and Caribbean countries and 30 (13 per cent) of Asia- Pacific countries. 13. As the above statistics demonstrate, there is a need to establish a mechanism which would offer universities based in developing countries an opportunity to participate in the Programme on a sustainable basis and to nominate students who may be selected as judicial fellows by the Court. This would correct the current 4/7 imbalance in the Programme which might otherwise be perceived as catering only to law graduates from a limited number of countries and the universities based therein. However, similar to any other activity involving the Court, such a mechanism should be compliant with the requirements of the Statute and Rules of the Court. Accordingly, the contemplated mechanism should not entail that the Court engages with individual Member States to mobilize contributions for its Judicial Fellowship Programme. In addition, the mechanism should not allow States who wish to support the Programme to offer or to make direct payments to the Court. 14. It is proposed that such a mechanism take the form of the trust fund established by the Secretary-General at the request of the General Assembly. The regulations of the trust fund will have to comply with the requirements of independence and impartiality of the Court in accordance with its Statute, while making it capable of providing an opportunity to young law graduates, from universities based in developing countries, to participate in the Programme. Ill. Purpose 15. The purpose of the trust fund is to grant fellowship awards to selected candidates who are nationals of developing countries from universities based in developing countries, thereby guaranteeing the geographic and linguistic diversity of the participants in the Programme. 16. The award will consist of a monthly stipend and will cover travel and health insurance costs. It should be sufficient to provide for a minimum standard of accommodation and subsistence in The Hague, in order to ensure that recipients can fully benefit from their participation in the Programme without the burden of financial hardship. IV. Authority 17. The trust fund will be administered in conformity with the applicable United Nations financial regulations, rules, policies and procedures. V. Contributions to the trust fund 18. Contributions to the trust fund can be made by States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, national institutions, bar associations, private institutions and individuals, and other appropriate entities. 19. Cash contributions to the trust fund may be accepted in fully convertible currencies. Such contributions will be deposited into the designated bank account. 20. The making of a pledge and its acceptance are to be recorded in an exchange of letters, and in a more formal agreement if requested by the donor. 21. Any interest income derived from contributions to the trust fund will be credited to the trust fund. VI. Administration 22. The trust fund will be administered by the Secretary-General. The Court may be associated with the performance of certain administrative functions of a general nature entailed by the management of the trust fund. However, the modalities for the 5/7 administration of the trust fund should not require the Court to directly engage with individual Member States to mobilize contributions to the trust fund or to be directly involved in the administration of the financial resources collected. VII. Application for the fellowship award 23. Universities based in developing countries that cannot afford to sponsor fellows that are nationals of developing countries may apply for a fellowship award for their candidates when nominating them for the Programme in accordance with the procedures established by the Court. VIII. Selection of the recipients and granting of the fellowship award 24. The Court will draw up and publicize the eligibility criteria for the fellowship award. 25. The Court will select the recipients of the award from the list of candidates who meet the standard eligibility criteria for the Programme. 26. The Court will make its final selection taking into account the available resources in the trust fund and the number of qualified candidates in respect of whom applications for the award have been made. IX. Reporting 27. The Secretary-General will provide an annual financial statement for the trust fund showing income and expenditures as at 31 December of each year and detailing the funds pledged and received. 28. Allaccounts and financial statements will be expressed in United States dollars. 29. The Secretary-General will prepare a substantive progress report on implementation as required by the General Assembly. X. Programme support costs 30. In accordance with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, programme support costs will be charged to the trust fund. In addition, the trust fund Operating reserve will be applied within the cash resources of the trust fund to cover any delays in payments of contributions and to meet final expenditures of the activities covered from the trust fund. The trust fund operating reserve is calculated as a percentage of the estimated annual expenditures. XI. Audit 31. The trust fund is exclusively subject to the internal and external auditing procedures provided for in the United Nations financial regulations, rules and policies. 6/7 XII. Closure of the trust fund 32. Should it be decided to close the trust fund for any reason, any balances for each donor remaining at the time the trust fund is terminated will be disposed of in consultation with the donor, and in a manner consistent with the purpose of the trust fund and with the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations. 20-16708 7/7",12/10/2020,2020_3894518,Philippines,N/A,yes
