Birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition everywhere as a person before the law,"The Human Rights Council, Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming the human right of everyone to be recognized everywhere as a person before the law, which is enshrined in, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and recalling the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and other relevant international instruments, Recalling the obligation of States to register all children, without discrimination of any kind, immediately after birth, which is an important element of the protection and realization

Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and other relevant international instruments to which they are party, Recognizing that birth registration and the right to recognition

approach to birth registration, based on international human rights obligations and commitments operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights, Welcoming States’ commitment to leave no one behind, and recalling that the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration, is included as the standalone target 16.9 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development under Sustainable Development Goal 16, Recognizing that the full implementation of this target will have both a direct and an indirect impact on the achievement of other targets and goals, inter alia social protection, protection in emergencies, access to financial and economic resources, the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and children everywhere, and access to quality education, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other treaty-based bodies towards universal birth registration, such as through recommendations widely addressed to States in this regard, Recalling the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council in which they call upon States to ensure the registration of all children immediately after birth, and without discrimination of any kind, the most recent being Assembly resolution 71/177 of 19 December 2016 and Council resolution 28/13 of 23 March 2015, Recognizing the importance of birth registration, including late birth registration and provision of documents of proof of birth, as a means of providing an official record of the existence of a person and the recognition of that individual as a person before the law, and as a critical means of preventing statelessness, Welcoming the 10-year campaign to end statelessness (the “I Belong” campaign of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), which aims to end the legal limbo of statelessness that affects millions of people around the world, Expressing concern that unregistered individuals may have limited or no access to services and the enjoyment of all the rights to which they are entitled, including the rights to a name and to acquire a nationality, and rights related to health, education, social welfare, work and political participation, and taking into consideration that registering a person’s birth is a vital step towards the promotion and

exploitation and abuse, including when they take the form of child labour, human trafficking, child, early and forced marriage, and unlawful child recruitment, Recognizing that free birth registration and free or low-fee late birth registration are part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and _ policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that non-governmental organizations, professional associations, media, the private sector and other members of civil society, including those involved in public-private partnerships, can also contribute to the improvement and promotion of community
