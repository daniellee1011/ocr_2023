Welcomes the following set of international rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States: 1. States should comply with the Charter of the United Nations and universally recognized norms governing international relations that enshrine, inter alia, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the diversity of history, culture and social systems of all countries. 2. Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of information and communications technologies and to prevent practices relating to such technologies that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security. 3. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security. 4. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability, and reaffirm the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations. 5. States should recognize the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States. 6. States should endeavour to ensure at all levels of the supply chain the security of information and communications technology goods and services, in order to prevent other States from exploiting their dominant position in information and communications technologies, including dominance in resources, critical infrastructures, core technologies, information and communications technology goods and services and information and 3/7 communications networks, to undermine the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services, or to threaten their political, economic and social security. 7. States should reaffirm the rights and responsibilities of all States, in accordance with the relevant norms and rules, regarding legal protection of their information space and critical information infrastructure against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage. 8. States should recognize that the rights of an individual in the offline environment must also be protected in the online environment; and fully respect rights and freedoms in the information space, including the right and freedom to seek, receive and impart information, taking into account the fact that article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* attaches to that right special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals; 9. All States must play the same role in, and carry equal responsibility for, international governance of the Internet, its security, continuity and stability of operation, and its development in a way which promotes the establishment of multilateral, transparent and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms which ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure the stable and secure functioning of the Internet. 10. States must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. However, the indication that an information and communications technology activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the information and communications technology infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. States should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated. In case of information and communications technology incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the information and communications technology environment and the nature and extent of the consequences. 11. States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies. States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies and should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts. 12. States should consider how best to cooperate to exchange information, assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of information and communications technologies and curb the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, separatism or extremism or that inflames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious grounds, and implement other cooperative measures to address such threats. States may need to consider whether new measures need to be developed in this respect. 4/7 13. States, in ensuring the secure use of information and communications technologies, should respect Human Rights Council resolutions 20/8 of 5 July 2012° and 26/13 of 26 June 2014° on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, as well as General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and 69/166 of 18 December 2014 on the right to privacy in the digital age, to guarantee full respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. 14. A State should not conduct or knowingly support information and communications technology activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public. 15. States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from information and communications technology threats, taking into account General Assembly resolution 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, and other relevant resolutions. 16. States should respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another State whose critical infrastructure is subject to malicious acts using information and communications technologies. States should also respond to appropriate requests to mitigate malicious information and communications technology activity aimed at the critical infrastructure of another State emanating from their territory, taking into account due regard for sovereignty. 17. States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of information and communications technology products, and the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services should not be undermined or their political, economic and social security threatened. 18. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious information and communications technology tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions. 19. States should encourage responsible reporting of information and communications technology vulnerabilities and share associated information on available remedies for such vulnerabilities to limit and possibly eliminate potential threats to information and communications technologies and infrastructure dependent on such technologies. 20. States should not conduct or knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams (sometimes known as computer emergency response teams or cybersecurity incident response teams) of another State. A State should not use authorized emergency response teams to engage in malicious international activity. 21. States should encourage the private sector and civil society to play an appropriate role to improve security of and in the use of information and communications technologies, including supply chain security for information and communications technology products and services. States should cooperate with the private sector and the organizations of civil society in the sphere of > See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 53 and corrigendum (A/67/53 and A/67/53/Corr.1), chap.

A. 5/7 implementation of rules of responsible behaviour in information space with regard to their potential role. 22. States should develop confidence-building measures aimed at increasing predictability and reducing the likelihood of misunderstanding and the risk of conflict. Such measures will include, inter alia, voluntary exchange of information regarding national strategies and organizational structures for ensuring a State’s information security, the publication of white papers and exchanges of best practice, wherever practical and advisable. 23. States should assist developing countries in their efforts to enhance capacity-building on information security and to close the digital divide. 24. States should bolster bilateral, regional and international cooperation, promote a prominent role for the United Nations in areas such as encouraging the development of international legal norms for information security, peaceful settlement of international disputes, qualitative improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security; and to enhance coordination among relevant international organizations. 25. States should settle any dispute resulting from the application of the present set of international rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States through peaceful means and refrain from the threat or use of force; 2.

the recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,’ as well as the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, adopted in Rome on 21 November 2014,° Acknowledging that the right to food has been recognized as the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate, nutritious food, in conformity with, inter alia, the culture, beliefs, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of individuals, that is produced and consumed sustainably, thereby preserving access to food for future generations, Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted in Rome on 16

footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food and nutrition security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the Declaration of the World Food Summit and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations ° See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document WSFS 2009/2. 2/11 contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, as well as in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and that these problems are increasing dramatically in some regions in the absence of urgent, determined and concerted action, Recognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, the least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility of commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe food insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, prevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, Stressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon Member States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to take further steps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of affected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national strategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition, Reaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited under international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to food, Stressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and nutrition availability, 3/11 Stressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Concerned that the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are harming agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus contributing to food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to increase with future climate change, Expressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the enjoyment of the right to food, Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and nutrition security and the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security!° by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in

International Conference on Nutrition, hosted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, and of its outcome documents, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, Stressing also the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture and nutrition, Recognizing that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, Recognizing also the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and nutrition and the right to food for all, Noting the cultural values of dietary and eating habits in different cultures, and recognizing that food plays an important role in defining the identity of individuals and communities and is a cultural component that describes and gives value to a territory and its inhabitants, 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document CL 144/9 (C 2013/20), appendix D. ""| Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document C 2015/20, appendix D. 4/11 Recognizing the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, Recognizing also the role of the Committee on World Food Security as an inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for a broad range of committed stakeholders to work together in a coordinated manner and in support of country-led processes towards the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security and nutrition for all human beings, Acknowledging the contribution of parliamentarians nationally and regionally to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition and ultimately to the realization of the right to food, and in this regard recognizing the convening of the first Global Parliamentary Summit against Hunger and Malnutrition, held in Madrid on 29 and 30 October 2018, Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, and recalling the commitment therein to work together to promote sustained and inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental protection and thereby to benefit all, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 of 27 July 2012, Recalling also the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030” and its guiding principles, which, inter alia, recognize the importance of promoting regular disaster preparedness and response and recovery exercises, with a view to ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, including access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as appropriate to local needs, as well as of fostering collaboration across global and regional mechanisms and institutions for the implementation and coherence of instruments and tools relevant to disaster risk reduction, such as for climate change, biodiversity, sustainable development, poverty eradication, environment, agriculture, health, food and nutrition and others, as appropriate, Recalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016—2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, and stressing the opportunity the Decade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition, Acknowledging the work done by the High-level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the Secretary-General in his continuing efforts in this regard, including continued engagement with Member States and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food, 1.

Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, up to 45 per cent of the children who die every year before the age Resolution 69/283, annex II. 5/11 of 5 die from undernutrition and hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people in the world affected by undernourishment, or chronic food deprivation, increased from around 804 million in 2016 to nearly 821 million in 2017; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people in the world is unacceptably high, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries and the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2016, reaching an estimated 821 million in 2017; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8.

Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; 10. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and promoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 6/11 11.

Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, including private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle water scarcity; 16. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation 3 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 and A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.

Also recalls the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held on 22 and 23 September 2014,!* and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; 23. Notes the need to further examine various concepts, such as “food sovereignty”, and their relation to food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 24. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all; 25.

with Disabilities, Taking note of the preparation of the United Nations 2018 flagship report on disability and development: realization of Sustainable Development Goals by, for and with persons with disabilities, and of the note by the Secretariat which provides an overview of the flagship report, !® Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Acknowledging the Secretary-General’s decision to conduct an institutional review of the current United Nations approach to mainstreaming disability across its operations, which would inform the preparation of an internal policy and action plan to strengthen the ability of the United Nations system to mainstream disabilities, in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters, Recognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, and that persons with disabilities and their families should receive social protection and assistance to enable the family and its members to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with disabilities, Recognizing further the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality, non-discrimination and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full 3/10 application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Concerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to get health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, a lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, Recognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities in development policies and programmes, and, in particular, in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, meaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive society and development, 4/10 Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,'’ and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high - quality, accessible, timely and reliable data to measure progress in the implementation of the Goals for persons with disabilities, 1.
