2012,General Assembly,N/A,Sixty-seventh session,N/A,United Nations Avw7/233,"You may recall that H.E. Mr. Kadir Topbas, Mayor of Istanbul and member of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, is leading this global organization of local authorities. Members of United Cities and Local Governments are committed to taking responsibility and action in shaping the future we want. The activities of United Cities and Local Governments can complement and support the work of the United Nations, in particular the follow-up process of the Rio+20 Conference and the development and implementation of the post-2015 development agenda. Turkey strongly believes that cooperation between the United Nations and United Cities and Local Governments needs to be promoted. Granting non-governmental observer status for United Cities and Local Governments in the General Assembly would be an important step to this effect. In this context, Turkey would like to request the inclusion in the agenda of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly of an additional item entitled “Observer status for United Cities and Local Governments in the General [li] 121012 ee) HO Please recycle 12-54416 ui 121012 CAT A A A/67/233 Assembly”. In accordance with rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly,",N/A,Turkey stands ready to work with the relevant departments of the Secretariat in this process. I am confident that you will spare no effort to support this initiative which will provide many benefits for global development endeavours.,"I should appreciate it if the present letter and its annexes could be circulated as a document of the General Assembly. (Signed) Ertugrul Apakan Ambassador Permanent Representative A/67/233 Annex I Explanatory memorandum United Cities and Local Governments currently gathers together 153 national and regional associations of local authorities from over 140 United Nations Member States, which represent three quarters of the world population. This makes United Cities and Local Governments a leading organization representing local and regional (subnational) governments internationally. United Cities and Local Governments is also in first-hand contact with leaders and national Governments regarding urban and subnational issues. United Cities and Local Governments is a membership-based international association that has its seat in Barcelona, Spain. It operates as a non-profit organization of local authorities for the public benefit. United Cities and Local Governments is the inheritor of a century-old international movement of local and regional governments and their national associations dating back to 1913 which organized the first World Assembly of Local Authorities and Cities in 1996 on the occasion of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) in Istanbul. The organization shares the principles and objectives of the United Nations. The activities of United Cities and Local Governments complement and support the work of the United Nations towards achieving sustainable development, through working relations with the relevant agencies of the United Nations. Local governments are recognized as key stakeholders in the policy-making of the United Nations by rule 64 of the rules of procedure of the UN-Habitat Governing Council, which is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly. United Cities and Local Governments has observer status in the Council. Furthermore, paragraph 44 of the outcome document of the Riot+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (General Assembly resolution 66/288, annex) and paragraph 174 of the Outcome of the Millennium+5 Summit (General Assembly resolution 60/1, annex) provide the foundation for furthering cooperation between the two international organizations. Local governments have a long history of cooperation with the United Nations through United Cities and Local Governments. Founding local government organizations of United Cities and Local Governments have held non-governmental organization consultative status with the Economic and Social Council since 1947. United Cities and Local Governments is the formal representative of those constituencies before numerous bodies: (a) Local authorities are identified as one of nine “major groups” in Agenda 21; (b) Local governments have further achieved recognition at major United Nations and international meetings, such as Beijing +10, the Millennium +5 Summit of Heads of State and Government and the World Water Forums; (c) Local government representatives have a special relationship with UN-Habitat and through rule 64 of its rules of procedure have distinct rights to participate as observers in the Governing Council of UN-Habitat; A/67/233 (d) In 2000, the United Nations Advisory Committee of Local Authorities was established as a body of elected local representatives that advises the Executive Director of UN-Habitat. The President of United Cities and Local Governments is the Permanent Chair of this Committee; (e) United Cities and Local Governments has been asked to advise the High- level Group for the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations to ensure that the views of the world’s mayors and councillors are taken into account in its report to the General Assembly; (f) The Department of Economic and Social Affairs has invited United Cities and Local Governments to the Advisory Board of the Development Cooperation Forum; (g) United Cities and Local Governments represented local and regional authorities in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Working Party on Aid Effectiveness; (h) In 2010, the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its 16th session, acknowledged local authorities as governmental stakeholders in issues related to the climate change agreements; (i) The President of United Cities and Local Governments and Mayor of Istanbul was appointed in July 2012 to the United Nations Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Process. United Cities and Local Governments has cooperation agreements and working relations with most of the United Nations agencies, for example UN-Habitat, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Institute for Training and Research and the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, and with the World Bank. There are further agreements under way with UN-Women and the International Labour Organization. The aspiration of United Cities and Local Governments is to build on the example of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which has enjoyed observer status since 2002, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 57/32, based on the unique and intergovernmental character of its constituency. As is the case with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the membership of United Cities and Local Governments represents a level of government in the respective countries. The membership of United Cities and Local Governments is institutional, as it is cities, regions, towns and associations that join the world organization. The members of United Cities and Local Governments are therefore directly accountable to the citizens, just as national Governments are. United Cities and Local Governments could become a catalyst for the collaboration and representation of local and regional authorities. It would enable multiple existing voices to contribute to shaping political and technical positions. In view of the post-2015 development process and the convening of a third United Nations conference on housing and sustainable urban development (Habitat III) in 2016, observer status for United Cities and Local Governments would significantly contribute to finding solutions for the global challenges that are being faced. A/67/233 Annex IT Draft resolution Observer status for United Cities and Local Governments in the General Assembly The General Assembly, Recalling its decision 49/426 of 9 December 1994, Considering the unique status of United Cities and Local Governments as a world organization of local and regional governments, Wishing to promote cooperation between the United Nations and United Cities and Local Governments, 1. Decides to invite United Cities and Local Governments to participate in its sessions and in its work in the capacity of observer; 2.

I, resolution 1, annexes I and II. A/C.3/67/L.20/Rev.1 Taking note of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and of the fact that part of her task is to integrate a gender- and age-specific perspective throughout the work of her mandate, inter alia, through the identification of gender- and age-specific vulnerabilities in relation to the issue of trafficking in persons, Acknowledging the inclusion of gender-related crimes in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, !° which entered into force on 1 July 2002, Bearing in mind that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish perpetrators of trafficking in persons, and to rescue victims as well as provide for their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims, Seriously concerned that an increasing number of women and girls are being trafficked, including to developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States, and that men and boys are also victims of trafficking, including for sexual exploitation, Recognizing that certain efforts against trafficking in persons lack the gender and age sensitivity needed to address effectively the situation of women and girls, who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour, services and other forms of exploitation, thus highlighting the need to incorporate a gender- and age-sensitive approach in all anti-trafficking efforts, Recognizing also the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, in particular girls, Recognizing further that poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination and marginalization are some of the contributing factors that make persons vulnerable to trafficking, Recognizing the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of being trafficked and to help to identify victims of trafficking in persons, Recognizing also that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls remain and that further efforts should be

and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Noting that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by trafficking in persons in some parts of the world, Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, on account of their gender, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness, Encouraging the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-seventh session to consider the issue of trafficking in women and girls within the framework of the priority theme for 2013, “Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls”, Reaffirming the importance of bilateral, subregional, regional and international cooperation mechanisms

demand the strong political commitment, coordinated and coherent efforts and the active cooperation of all Governments of countries of origin, transit and destination, Recognizing that policies and programmes for prevention, protection, rehabilitation, repatriation and reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, transit and destination, Convinced of

persons with disabilities, including all individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), developmental disorders (DD) and associated disabilities, and their integration in societies, as well as addressing the socioeconomic needs of their families and communities, Reaffirming the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, Affirming that ensuring and promoting the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, without distinction, is critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, Recalling its resolution 66/124 of 19 December 2011, by which it decided to convene a one-day high-level meeting of the General Assembly, on 23 September 2013, with the overarching theme “The way forward: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond”, which shall be funded within existing resources, in order to strengthen efforts to ensure accessibility for and the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development efforts, Aware that autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects the functioning of the brain, characterized by impairments in social interaction, problems with verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests and activities, Aware also that the vast variety of needs of individuals with ASD, DD and associated disabilities poses a substantial challenge to addressing the disability and providing the appropriate services for treatment and care by Government and non-governmental organizations, Deeply concerned that children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities in all regions of the world experience challenges in accessing long-term health care, education, training and intervention programmes undertaken by Governments, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, Concerned also that those persons with ASD, DD and associated disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society, and reaffirming that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person, Recalling that early diagnosis, appropriate research and effective interventions are vital to the growth and development of the individual, and emphasizing that early intervention is crucial for addressing the needs of the individual with ASD, DD and associated disabilities, thus improving the opportunities to live a quality life A/67/L.33 with the ability to participate in the greater community and increasing the

World Health Assembly, requesting the Director General of the World Health Organization to develop a comprehensive mental health action plan, for consideration by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly, ® Recognizing that a major barrier to improving the health and well-being of children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities and their families is the paucity of knowledge and expertise to recognize symptoms and identify ASD, and also recognizing that the absence of effective routine screening that allows for early detection, in turn, limits access to care and early interventions and that, without research to develop and implement effective programmes, the emergence of appropriate solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families does not occur, Acknowledging efforts to increase awareness of the rights of those affected by ASD, DD and associated disabilities, including the commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day, which led to
