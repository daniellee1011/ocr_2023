Notes that the growing demand for natural resources, including water, the consequences of erosion, deforestation and other forms of watershed degradation, and the occurrence of natural disasters, as well as increasing out-migration, the pressures of industry, transport, tourism, mining and agriculture and the consequences of global climate change are some of the key challenges in fragile mountain ecosystems to implementing sustainable development and eradicating poverty in mountains, consistent with the Millennium Development Goals; 11. Notes with concern the accelerating melting of mountain glaciers, and stresses the need to undertake immediate actions to preserve the glaciers as major reservoirs of water in the world; 12. Underlines the importance of enhancing the capacity of mountains to serve as natural carbon sinks through effective and sustainable forest management and the avoidance of deforestation, as well as the restoration of lost and degraded forest ecosystems of mountains; 13. Notes that sustainable agriculture in mountain regions is important for the protection of the mountain environment and the promotion of the rural economy; 14. Expresses its deep concern at the number and scale of disasters and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in mountain regions, especially those in developing countries; 15. Encourages Governments and other relevant stakeholders to improve awareness, preparedness and infrastructure to cope with regularly occurring disasters in mountain regions, such as flash floods, including glacial lake outburst floods, as well as land slides, debris flow and earthquakes; 16. Encourages the scientific community, national Governments and intergovernmental organizations to collaborate with mountain communities to jointly study and address the negative effects of global climate change on mountain environments and biological diversity, as well as the specific concerns of mountain communities, with a view to elaborating sustainable adaptation strategies to cope with the negative impacts of climate change; 17. Underlines that action at the national level is a key factor in achieving progress in sustainable mountain development, welcomes its steady increase in recent years with a multitude of events, activities and initiatives, and invites the international community to support the efforts of developing countries to develop and implement strategies and programmes, including, where required, enabling policies and laws, for the sustainable development of mountains, within the framework of national development plans; 18.

Underlines the importance for sustainable development in mountains of exploring a wide range of funding sources, such as public-private partnerships, increased opportunities for microfinance, including microcredit and microinsurance, small housing loans, savings, education and health accounts, support for entrepreneurs seeking to develop small and medium-sized businesses and, where appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, debt for sustainable development swaps; 27. Notes that the awareness of the society as a whole needs to be raised in respect of the role of mountains as an important source of positive externalities® like biodiversity, flood and soil protection, water supply and quality, carbon sequestration, avalanche protection, fire protection, cultural landscapes, outdoor recreation as well as cultural heritage; 5 Externalities are defined as unaccounted side effects of an economic activity. They may be positive (e.g. preventing floods) or negative (e.g. causing floods). In mountain areas, the beneficiaries of such externalities are downstream water users, food consumers and tourists, while its providers are farmers and other mountain dwellers. In the first place, there is no market for externalities, so they cannot be bought or sold. However, a market can be created in which externalities are valorized. A/C.2/62/L.18 28. Underlines the importance of considering pro-poor national and international policies and national financing instruments, where appropriate, to compensate mountain populations and communities for the provision of such positive externalities; 29. Notes with satisfaction the adoption by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity® of a programme of work on mountain biological diversity, the overall purpose of which is the significant reduction of the loss of mountain biological diversity by 2010 at the global, regional and national levels, and its implementation, which aims at making a significant contribution to poverty eradication in mountain regions; 30.

Also notes with appreciation the Framework Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Carpathians,® adopted and signed by the seven countries of the region to provide a framework for cooperation and multisectoral policy coordination, a platform for joint strategies for sustainable development and a forum for dialogue between all involved stakeholders; 33. Further notes with appreciation the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, which promotes transboundary cooperation among eight regional member countries of the Himalaya Hindu Kush region to foster action and change for overcoming mountain peoples’ economic, social and_ physical vulnerability; 34.
