The Bureau recommends that the Commission's confidential RECOMMENDATION 1 1. 1503 procedure be amended in the following ways: Deliberations to select situations which should be brought to the (a) attention of the Commission should be conducted by a single body, a Committee on Situations, comprised of five independent experts appointed each year by the Chair of the Commission (no individual to serve more than three years), and meeting twice per year: First, at the beginning of September to examine monthly (1) summaries of communications prepared by the secretariat, E/CN.4/1999/L.101 page 10 originals of communications and any government replies At that time the Committee would decide received to date. which communications it should refer to States for clarification, requesting that any replies be submitted on time for the next meeting; and Second, 1in January, to examine dossiers on the situations (ii) concerned, including original communications, replies received from Governments and any additional relevant information from other United Nations sources, including treaty monitoring bodies and special procedures. The Committee would then determine whether or not to refer the situations before it to the Commission for its consideration, and prepare a summary report identifying the main issues of concern and suggested ways of addressing those concerns, but would not make recommendations in the form of resolutions or decisions; Deliberations at the Commission level would also involve two (b) phases: A closed meeting at the earliest possible stage in the (1) session, to which the Governments concerned would be invited, to undertake a meaningful dialogue with the Commission; and A second closed meeting, towards the conclusion of the (ii) session, and in the presence of the Governments concerned, to decide on appropriate action, including a decision whether to continue or discontinue consideration of the matter within the confidential procedure, or whether to take up the matter in the Commission's public proceedings - which should be the principal option in cases in which government cooperation has been inadequate; At the conclusion of a session, the Chair of the Commission should (c) announce publicly the names of the countries considered, the main issues of concern and the course of action which the Commission has decided to take; OHCHR would continue to play a crucial role in providing the (d) necessary support for the procedure to ensure effective performance of all the necessary tasks, inter alia: E/CN.4/1999/L.101 page 11 Ensuring appropriate acknowledgement, and referral to concerned Governments, of communications received; Sifting out communications that appear to be manifestly unfounded; Ensuring that Governments concerned are kept appropriately and punctually advised of any decision taken in the Committee that requires their attention; Preparing material/dossiers for deliberations by the Committee and the Commission.

To preserve the image of the Sub-Commission as an independent expert body, no member should be concurrently employed in the executive branch of their country's Government; The length of annual sessions of the Sub-Commission should (ii) be reduced to two weeks; The Sub-Commission's work and priorities should be based on tasks (c) entrusted to it by the Commission on Human Rights, with the principal focus on the elaboration of studies, research and expert advice at the request of The Commission should regard the Sub-Commission's experts the Commission. as its foremost resource for the performance of such assignments, rather than appointing others to undertake expert research and analysis; and in considering the assignment of projects to the Sub-Commission, the Commission might consider relevant proposals from the High Commissioner for Human Rights, from other United Nations human rights institutions and from the Sub-Commission itself; The Sub-Commission's working methods in respect of its research (d) and study projects should, consistent with the independent expert character of E/CN.4/1999/L.101 page 12 the body, entail a well-prepared, thorough peer-review process culminating in an analytical report to the Commission comprising the final text of the study in question, any agreed recommendations on further steps and a summary of This approach would major observations of members of the Sub-Commission. preclude the need for negotiating traditional resolutions for submission to While the Sub-Commission's deliberations should provide the Commission. opportunities for interested Governments, international organizations and NGOs to provide input into this process, the experts should also be prepared to dedicate adequate time to private deliberations on their projects, inter alia in the framework of sessional working groups such as the existing working group on the administration of justice; Recognizing the important opportunities the Sub-Commission and (e) some of its subsidiary bodies play in affording a public forum for concerned parties to raise their human rights concerns: The Sub-Commission should continue to conduct an annual (1) debate on human rights violations in all parts of the world. However, rather than leading to the negotiation of resolutions, this debate should be reflected in a summary to the Commission as part of the Sub-Commission's annual report; The Sub-Commission's inter-sessional Working Groups on (ii) Minorities and on Indigenous Populations should continue to perform the valuable work they are engaged in, the latter until such time as the question of its future status is resolved in the context of the Commission's deliberations on a permanent forum for indigenous people in the The question of the Working Group United Nations system. on Contemporary Forms of Slavery is addressed in recommendation 1 above; As regards transitional arrangements associated with these (f) proposed changes, the Bureau recommends that the Commission devise a transitional process aimed at bringing the recommended reforms fully into effect for the fifty-second session of the Sub-Commission in the year 2000.

If, by the end of its mandate, the working group has not been able to achieve a result, the Commission should set a period of reflection (such as one or two years) before any extension is provided; Regarding the question of concluding a standard-setting exercise (c) with or without a vote, it should be borne in mind that there is no rule of procedure requiring the Commission on Human Rights, ECOSOC or the General Assembly to adopt standard-setting instruments by consensus, and there are indeed examples where consensus has not been achieved. Of course, all efforts should be made at reaching consensus; Finally, all working group chairs (whose terms should be linked (d) with that of the working group) should have standing authority to undertake, between working group meetings, informal contacts and consultations with a view to advancing progress in respect of the working group's mandate. Results of such consultations should be communicated to concerned delegations on a timely basis and at the start of each session.",04/23/1999,1999_1489910,Finland,N/A,yes
