The current stage in the development of international relations is characterized by the increasing political importance of regional and subregional relations and associations of States. Their activities are multifaceted in nature. In many important and relevant areas such as international cooperation in the fields of trade, customs matters, and migration and in the social and humanitarian spheres, there has been a close interweaving of the efforts undertaken by inter-State associations and the United Nations. The Eurasian Economic Community (hereafter referred to as EURASEC or the Community), which is the successor to the Treaty on the Customs Union and the Single Economic Zone, has confirmed its place among international organizations. 2. The Community’s tasks are to: (a) setup acustom’s union; (b) establish a single economic zone. 3. EURASEC is composed of the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tajikistan as member States and Ukraine, the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Moldova as observers. 4. In view of the initial results of the activities of EURASEC, it is possible to speak of real potential for cooperation by the Community and the universal international organization on the basis of the principles of partnership, shared participation and complementarity of efforts. 5. In our view, in order to achieve the most effective and optimum level of cooperation and interaction between EURASEC and the United Nations, their mutual relations should be consolidated in future on a regular and well-established basis. The granting of observer status in the General Assembly for the Community would serve this end. Such a step would make it possible to strengthen in practice cooperation between EURASEC and the United Nations and expand their mutual capabilities for assisting efforts to ensure peace, security and cooperation on both a regional and a global scale.
