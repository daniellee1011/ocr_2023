Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 9 See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report on the State of Food Insecurity in the World 2006 (Rome, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2006). 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Pérto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (c 2006/REP), appendix G.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; A/C.3/62/L.53/Rev.1 21. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 22. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 23.
