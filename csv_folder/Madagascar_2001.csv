Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session (E/CN.4/2001/56), commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further; 2. Stresses that structural adjustment policies have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 3. Notes with concern the persistence of the external debt problem, that the vicious cycle of debt and underdevelopment has become further entrenched, that debt service has grown at a much greater rate than the debt itself and that the burden of payments has become heavier in many developing countries, including those with low and middle incomes, despite repeated rescheduling, and that the current debt and poverty reduction and growth initiatives lack sufficient funding and have several conditions attached; 4. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session (resolution S-24/2, of 1 July 2000, annex, chap. ]) to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 5. Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based, inter alia, in open, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, predictable, transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems, which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 6. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and a consistent way, with the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the specific characteristics, conditions and needs of the debtor countries; 7. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment polices, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 8. Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt, in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms, to be extended, expedited, implemented completely and made more flexible, and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives, which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis; 9. Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 10. Requests the independent expert to present an analytical report to the Commission, on an annual basis, on the implementation of the present resolution, paying particular attention to: (a) The effects of the foreign debt and the policies adopted to face them on the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular, economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries; (b) Measures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries; (c) New developments, actions and initiatives being taken by international financial institutions, other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with respect to structural adjustment policies and human rights; 11.

Also calls upon Governments, international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries, giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters; 16. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the 12. 16. population in the affected countries; 17. Recognizes that there is a need for more transparency, participation by all States and consideration of the relevant resolutions of the Commission in the deliberations and 17. activities of international and regional financial institutions; 18. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem, there is a need for a political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests 18. and responsibilities; 19. Requests the Economic and Social Council to authorize the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic, social and cultural rights to meet for two weeks well in advance of, and at least four weeks prior to, the fifty-eighth session of the Commission with the mandate to: (a) continue working on the elaboration of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic, social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and international financial institutions, and () report to the Commission at its fifty-eighth session; 20.
