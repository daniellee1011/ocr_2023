“Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted the outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, recognizing that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, and envisaging a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want, a world of universal respect for human rights and human dignity that includes equitable and universal access to health-care services and social protection, and where physical, mental and social well-being are assured, Recognizing that the 2030 Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law, and is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome, and is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development, Reaffirming that the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda are integrated and

founded on the dignity of the human person, and reflecting the principles of equality and non- discrimination, Reaffirming the right of refugees and migrants to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Concerned about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of

and environmental determinants of health, as well as to address holistically a range of barriers arising from inequality and discrimination that impede access to health-care services, Noting with concern that, for millions of people throughout the world, especially for women and girls, the full enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health remains a distant goal, Recognizing that women, youth, children, indigenous persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, persons living with HIV and people of African descent face particular challenges and multifaceted and intersecting forms of discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Deeply concerned that persons with mental health conditions or psychosocial disabilities, in particular persons using mental health services, may be subject to, inter alia, widespread discrimination, stigma, prejudice, violence, social exclusion and segregation, unlawful or arbitrary institutionalization, overmedicalization and treatment practices that fail to respect their autonomy, will and preferences, Deeply concerned also that, despite the impressive reductions in maternal mortality rates achieved since 1990, according to the World Health Organization, in 2015, there were an estimated 303,000 maternal deaths of women and girls, which were largely preventable, and that many more women and girls suffer serious and sometimes lifelong injuries, which have severe consequences for their enjoyment of their human rights and their overall well- being, Deeply concerned further that more than 5,900,000 children under 5 years of age die each year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to inadequate access or lack of access to integrated and quality maternal, newborn and child health-care services, to early childbearing, and to health determinants, such as safe drinking water and sanitation, safe and adequate food and nutrition, and that mortality remains highest among children belonging to the poorest and most marginalized communities, Regretting the high number of people still without access to

disproportionately high in developing countries, Noting with concern that approximately 54 per cent of persons living with HIV are in need of treatment, many of whom do not know their HIV status, Concerned at the instances of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuses that affect the enjoyment of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen law, policies and practices to eradicate any form of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuse in health-care services, Recognizing that universal health coverage implies that all people have access without discrimination to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and essential, safe, affordable, efficacious and quality A/HRC/35/L.18/Rev.1

marginalized segments of the population, Underscoring that the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, contributes to the efforts to implement the health-related Sustainable Development Goals, while recognizing that, inter alia, discrimination, stigma, corruption, violence and abuse are major obstacles in this regard, Underscoring also that the implementation of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals contributes to the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Stressing the importance of strengthening the meaningful participation of women in decision-making processes and developing gender-sensitive multisectoral health policies and programmes in order to address their needs, Recognizing the need for States, in cooperation with international organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to create favorable conditions at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of the right of everyone to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Recognizing also the positive contribution of the work of the Human Rights Council, including through its universal periodic review mechanism, to national, regional and global efforts for the implementation of the

development, and envisaging a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want, a world of universal respect for human rights and human dignity that includes equitable and universal access to health-care services and social protection, and where physical, mental and social well-being are assured, Recognizing that the 2030 Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of

Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome, and is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development, Reaffirming that the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda are

well- being, Deeply concerned further that more than 5,900,000 children under 5 years of age die each year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to inadequate access or lack of access

developing countries, Noting with concern that approximately 54 per cent of persons living with HIV are in need of treatment, many of whom do not know their HIV status, Concerned at the instances of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuses that affect the enjoyment of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen law, policies and practices to eradicate any form of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuse in health-care services,

rehabilitative essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and essential, safe, affordable, efficacious and quality A/HRC/35/L.18 medicines, vaccines,
