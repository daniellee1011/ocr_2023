Also stresses the importance of continuing to implement immediate, effective and durable actions for alleviating the burdens of debt and debt-service of the developing countries with debt problems, in the framework of the realization of economic, social and cultural rights; 3.

Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from the foreign debt to take account of the specific characterstics, conditions and needs of the debtor countries and the need to incorporate the social dimension of development; 5. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms arising from the debt; 6. Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on the foreign debt, in particular in the debt initiative for the heavily indebted poor countries and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms, to be implemented completely and flexibly, and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives, which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis; 7. Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty, and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 8. Requests the Special Rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights to present an analytical report to the Commission, on an annual basis, on the implementation of the present resolution, paying particular attention to: (a) The negativ ffects of the foreign debt and the policies adopted to face it on the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries; (b) easures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries; 9.

Recognizes that there is a need for more transparency in the activities of international financial institutions; 14.

Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 5. Welcomes the convening of a follow-up consultation on the right to adequate food by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on 18 and 19 November 1998 as requested by the Commission in resolution 1998/23, as a concrete and practical response to objective 7.4 of the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action, in order better to define the rights relating to food in article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and to propose ways to implement and realize those rights as a means of achieving the commitments of the World Food Summit; 6.

Organizations of the United Nations system,? other international organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations are invited to provide support to Member States in implementing the Action Plan, according to their available resources, specific mandates and the different roles that they are to play in achieving the goals set out in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction. 3. The Action Plan reflects the emphasis in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction on the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach involving demand reduction and supply reduction, each reinforcing the other, together with the appropriate application of the principle of shared responsibility. It stresses the need for services responsible for prevention, including law enforcement agencies, to transmit the same message and use similar language. 4. The Action Plan is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.?! It allows for flexible approaches to reflect social, cultural, religious and political differences, and it acknowledges that efforts to reduce illicit drug demand are at different levels of implementation in different countries. 5.

Such programmes should be integrated to promote cooperation between all concerned, should include a wide variety of appropriate interventions, should promote health and social well-being among individuals, families and communities, and should reduce the adverse consequences of drug abuse for the individual and for society as a whole. 6.
