Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the declarations and programmes of actions of and follow-up processes to the United Nations world conferences summits held in Vienna,3 Cairo,4 Copenhagen,5 Istanbul,6 Durban’ and J ohannesburg,8 Reaffirming the Declaration adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth session as a follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and to the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, which emphasizes that the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action is essential to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and stresses the need to ensure the integration of a gender perspective in the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the review of the Millennium Declaration, Recalling its resolution 2004/21 of 16 April 2004 on adequate housing as a component on the right to an adequate standard of living, and resolution 2003/22 of 22 April 2003 on women’s equal ownership, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that women’s equal ownership, access to and control over land and the equal right to own property and to adequate housing contribute to the full realization of human rights, Recognizing that women, particularly women living in extreme poverty and victims of domestic violence, continue to suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, inter alia on the grounds of property, as well as from discriminatory treatment in all areas decisive to the attainment of adequate housing, Reaffirming the human right to be free from all forms of discrimination and the equal right of women and men to the enjoyment of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, Mindful of the fact that elimination of discrimination against women and the achievement of substantive equality of women and girls require consideration of women’s specific socio-economic context, Welcoming the findings of the former Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences (see E/CN.4/2000/68/Add.5), in particular, the recognition that women’s poverty, together with a lack of alternative housing options, make it difficult for women to leave violent family situations, and reaffirming that forced relocation and forced eviction from home and land have a disproportionately severe impact on women, including when these are committed by spouses or in-laws, and encouraging the new Special Rapporteur to continue to take these findings into consideration in her future work, Recognizing that poverty is a major obstacle to women’s full realization of housing, land and property rights, Convinced that the lack of adequate housing can make women more vulnerable to various forms of violence, including domestic violence, and in particular that the lack of housing alternatives may limit many women’s ability to leave violent situations, Stressing that the impact of gender-based discrimination and violence against women on women’s equal ownership of, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing is acute, particularly during complex emergency situations, reconstruction and rehabilitation, Recognizing that the Secretary-General has linked the growing prevalence of HIV/AIDS in women with laws that inhibit the full enjoyment of women’s rights to land ownership and inheritance, and that he has called for positive change and attention to women’s empowerment and protection of women’s housing and

which calls for all Governments to strengthen or enforce legislation, regulations and other measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by people living with HIV/AIDS and members of vulnerable groups, in particular, to ensure their access to inheritance and legal protections, Recognizing that laws, policies, customs, traditions and practices that act to restrict women’s equal access to credit and loans also prevent women from owning and inheriting land, property and housing and exclude women from participating fully in development processes, are discriminatory and contribute to increasing the poverty of women and girls, Convinced that international, regional and local trade, finance and investment policies should be designed in such a way that they promote gender equality in terms of ownership of, access to and control over land and the rights to own property and to adequate housing and other productive resources and do not undermine women’s capacity to acquire and retain these resources, Also convinced of the need to address specifically the impact of natural disasters on women’s and children’s adequate housing needs and to ensure that a human rights approach, including a gender perspective, is taken when addressing this impact, 1.

Reaffirms Commission on the Status of Women resolution 42/1, which, inter alia, urges States to design and revise laws to ensure that women are accorded full and equal rights to own land and other property, and the right to adequate housing, including through the right to inheritance, and to undertake administrative reforms and other necessary measures to give women the same right as men to credit, capital, appropriate technologies, access to markets and information,; 5.

Invites the Secretary-General to encourage all organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, individually and collectively, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), to undertake further initiatives that promote women’s equal ownership of, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing, and allocate further resources for studying, documenting and addressing the impact of complex emergency situations and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, particularly with respect to women’s equal rights to own land, property and adequate housing; 12. 13.

BASIC PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES ON THE RIGHT TO A REMEDY AND REPARATION FOR VICTIMS OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW Preamble Recalling the provisions providing a right to a remedy for victims of violations of international human rights law found in numerous international instruments, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at article 8, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights at article 2, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination at article 6, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment at article 14, the Convention on the Rights of the Child at article 39, and of international humanitarian law as found in article 3 of the Hague Convention of 18 October 1907 concerning the Laws and Customs of War and Land (Convention No. IV of 1907), article 91 of Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), and articles 68 and 75 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Recalling the provisions providing a right to a remedy for victims of violations of international human rights found in regional conventions, in particular the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights at article 7, the American Convention on Human Rights at article 25, and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms at article 13, Recalling the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power emanating from the deliberations of the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, and resolution 40/34 of 29 November 1985 by which the General Assembly adopted the text recommended by the Congress, Reaffirming the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, including that victims should be treated with compassion and respect for their dignity, have their right to access to justice and redress mechanisms fully respected, and that the establishment, strengthening and expansion of national funds for compensation to victims should be encouraged, together with the expeditious development of appropriate rights and remedies for victims, Noting that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court requires the establishment of “principles relating to reparation to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation” and requires the Assembly of States Parties to establish a trust fund for the benefit of victims of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims, and mandates the Court “to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of victims” and to permit the participation of victims at all “stages of the proceedings determined to be appropriate by the Court”, Affirming that the Principles and Guidelines contained herein are directed at gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law which, by their very grave nature, constitute an affront to human dignity, Emphasizing that the Principles and Guidelines do not entail new international or domestic legal obligations but identify mechanisms, modalities, procedures and methods for the implementation of existing legal obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law which are complementary though different as to their norms, Recalling that international law contains the obligation to prosecute perpetrators of certain international crimes in accordance with international obligations of States and the requirements of national law or as provided for in the applicable statutes of international judicial organs, and that the duty to prosecute reinforces the international legal obligations to be carried out in accordance with national legal requirements and procedures and supports the concept of complementarity, Noting further that contemporary forms of victimization, while essentially directed against persons, may nevertheless also be directed against groups of persons who are targeted collectively, Recognizing that, in honouring the victims’ right to benefit from remedies and reparation, the international community keeps faith with the plight of victims, survivors and future human generations, and reaffirms the international legal principles of accountability, justice and the rule of law, Convinced that, in adopting a victim-oriented perspective, the international community affirms its human solidarity with victims of violations of international law, including violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as well as with humanity at large, in accordance with the following Basic Principles and Guidelines. I. OBLIGATION TO RESPECT, ENSURE RESPECT FOR AND IMPLEMENT INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW AND INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW 1.

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures proposed or implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation for the last few years; 2. Welcomes the fact that the High Commissioner recently submitted a comprehensive proposal to the Office of Human Resources Management that will effectively discontinue the practice of hiring temporary staff for regular functions of the Office of the High Commissioner through the regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field to align the recruitment policy of the Office with that of the United Nations Secretariat; 3. Regrets that most of the measures described therein are not new and, as the statistics show, they are either inadequate or inadequately or insufficiently applied and they have failed to produce any concrete improvement in the geographical distribution of the staff of the Office to date, and that the report does not provide for specific targets and deadlines to be achieved in order to reduce the current imbalance in the staff, as requested in paragraph 23 (a) of Commission resolution 2004/73; 4. Expresses its concern that, while nationals of 30 out of 43 developed countries are represented in the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the overwhelming majority of developing countries, 102 out of 148, have not a single national on the staff of the Office, despite the fact that 13 out of 15 unrepresented countries and 6 out of the 5. Also expresses its concern that the number of nationals of most of the developed countries overrepresented, underrepresented or within range at the level of the whole Secretariat outnumber by many times the average number of nationals of individual developing countries represented on the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 6. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 7. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU/REP/2003/6) that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner; 8. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than in those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 9. Takes note with appreciation that the recommendations for the selection of staff for technical cooperation activities and advisory services will be subject to the review of the Office’s internal Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues and that the composition of the Panel has been reviewed to balance its geographical distribution, as requested by Commission resolution 2004/73, and requests the High Commissioner to ensure that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general and to report to the Commission on the current composition of the Panel; 10. Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from unrepresented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive 10. examinations; 11. Welcomes the statement in the report that the Office of the High Commissioner has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts, involving the screening of candidates at the initial recruitment stage, including of short-term staff, to ensure that, between equally qualified candidates, priority is given to candidates from such countries, but regrets that in the last year there has been a further increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from one regional group, enlarging the existing chronic geographical imbalance, and requests the High Commissioner to use the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 11. 12. Also welcomes the assurance of the High Commissioner that she attaches the utmost importance to equitable geographical representation, as well as to the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity on the part of the staff of her Office and the fact that the High Commissioner has paid particular attention to geographical diversity in the recruitment of the senior managers, since four out of seven posts subject to geographical distribution at the D-1 level and above are encumbered by staff from developing countries; 12. 13. Expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 13. discontinued; 14. Stresses that the proposal made in the last year by the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and is, therefore, unacceptable; 14. 15. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, 15. furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office at Geneva; 16. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 17. Also reiterates that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 17. 18. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 18. 19. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 19. 20. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 20. 21. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 21. 22. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 22. 23. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 23. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 24. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of her mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 24. 25. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 25. Requests the High Commissioner: 26. (a) To ensure that the one-time post regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field results in a new and balanced geographical distribution of the staff of the Office, advertising the posts to be regularized and filling them in a transparent and competitive manner, following United Nations practices and provisions; (b) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (c) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; (d) To use also the programmes and funds for technical cooperation and human rights education for the training of national technical personnel in developing countries and countries with economies in transition through the use of Junior Professional Officers from these countries, with a view to guaranteeing that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers and that every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; (e) To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-second session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 27. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 28. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights”, in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 28. 29. Recalls its request to the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other United Nations intergovernmental bodies regarding the management, programmes and administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; 29.

Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 5.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 17. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, A/C.3/61/L.27 while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 19.
