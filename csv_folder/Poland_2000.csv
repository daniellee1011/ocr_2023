Each of the answer sheets represents one country's opinion. The responses reflect the state of the ENIMPAS database in October to early November 1999. 7. All the respondents are from the government sector and, except one, all are aware of the Oslo decision about the ENIMPAS database. Regarding the technical background of the users, they have an average work experience with the Internet of two and a half years. 55% of users regularly use information technology, while 44% do so occasionally. All the users work in EIA, and on average have an EIA experience of 5.5 years and experience with the Espoo Convention for almost three years. The number of Espoo cases occurred so far in their countries varied significantly from 0 to 5, with an average of almost 2. B. Need for the database 8. Almost 90% of the users said that the ENIMPAS database can help their Espoo-related work, and only 10% reported that the database is not useful from this perspective. The ENIMPAS database is mainly used for obtaining information, whereas both obtaining and providing information comes in second place. The use of the database only for providing information by authorized contact points is not typical. 9. Only 50% of users think that the database could improve the implementation of the Espoo Convention, and 50% state that the database can only partly improve such work. 10. the Some of the users specify the reasons of improving the implementation of database and mentioned: the usefulness for countries and NGOs, when providing impetuses and suggestions for third parties, ope on EIA, better practice and practical information. EIA information is n, opportunity to gain EIA information, information about projects, ideas 11. The most useful features for users are its information on other EIA cases and on relevant institutions and people. Finding pieces of legislation in other countries comes second. 12. There is a clear need for the database to contain broad information assisting the Espoo-related work. On the other hand, the database is not seen as a powerful means for assisting the implementation of the Espoo Convention. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex T Page 5 C. Use of the database 13. 63% of the users use the database a few times a year, 16% on a weekly basis and 16% never. The number of hits on the Internet homepage was not taken into account, because it does not reflect the real use of the database and may therefore bias the evaluation. 14. Many users access the ENIMPAS database a few times a year, which may indicate that its information is not attractive enough and doees not entice them to visit it more frequently. D. Database structure 15. 2 users rate the structure of the database ""excellent"", 13 users ""good"" and 1 user ""poor"". The database structure is thought appropriate for serving the implementation of the Espoo Convention. E. OQuantity and quality of information - content of the database 16. 82% of the users do not find inaccuracies in the database, however 18% do (e.g. list of Signatories and dates), and use other UN/ECE homepages to find the correct information. 75% of the users report that they do not use the database as a resource, and the few who do find that the database does not provide relevant project information with one exception. The simple reason, according to the answers received, is that the database does not contain enough relevant information. Almost 70% of the users do not find the information they are looking for when searching for specific projects, institutions, legislation or research/training. 17. very useful about transboundary projects, fairl training in other countries, fairl Regarding information about EIA legislation, 4 out of 18 users say it is 8 fairly useful and 8 not use and 8 not useful at all. Regarding information 5 out of 18 users think it is very useful, 6 Regarding information on research and and 9 not use of 18 believe it to be very useful, 6 Regarding information about EIA institutions in other countries, fairl and 6 not use 7 out of 18 users find it very useful, 6 Almost 61% of the respondents find the amount of information in the Half the users state that information in the 38% say it is fairly useful and 18. database unsatisfactory. database is not useful in their work at all, only 11% assess it to be very useful. 19. Users suggest additional categories of information that can be useful, such as: MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex I Page 6 Activities under the Convention work-plan (incl. small working groups) ; Different progress reports; List of country data managers; New documents under “What’s New” regarding bilateral and multilateral agreements; Available EIA guidance. However, one user believes that additional categories should be included only at a later stage. 20. By the end of the evaluation period the quality of information was acceptable. However, countries are in a position to judge the accuracy of their own information only. The usefulness of the information of the database is poor in the main branches of the services it provides so that half the users do not see the database as being useful in their work. F. User-friendliness 21. 62% of users find the database very easy to use, while 31% have needed some time to get acquainted with it. 10 users out of 19 find the access via Internet fast, 5 think it is usually slow and 3 report it to be slow and sometimes not available. 22. ENIMPAS users also report some, mainly technical, hitches with the search facilities in the database, case-sensitivity, etc. Also, the preferred Internet browser (Netscape) is criticized, because it is not seen as mainstream software for the future. The right to enter information about a certain project into the database is sometimes considered to be a problem. 23. User responses show that the database generally has the technical and structural design to serve users effectively. However, authorized users indicate several problems when providing information and placing it in the database. G. Database Management 24. Almost three manager; the ones difficulties are p a lack of training quarters of users do not contact the Polish database who do tend to get a good or rceived in som xcellent response. Some cases when opening the software and due to in using the database. H. Cost-Benefit aspects 25. User opinions are not unanimous on whether the time and costs involved in using the This seems to of informatio ENIMPAS database are worth it: 64% say yes, while 36% say no. be in contradiction with the opinions regarding the poor amount n available in the database. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex T Page 7 26. Evaluating the direct operating costs of the database management was not part of the study. 27. There is very limited information available regarding the cost-benefit aspects of the database. On the users' side, there is very little cost involved in obtaining information from the database once the hardware and software are in place. Major costs are foreseen for collecting and arranging information on the country level. Further steps could be taken to assess the database management costs, for which the start-up figures may serve as a starting point. The overall benefit of the database seems to be acceptable. I. Capacity and willingness of countries to provide information for the database 28. Regarding the special experience of authorized ENIMPAS users, more than half state that all the necessary information is available in their organizations, less than half say it is only partly available. Th quipment and Internet connection arre easily available to more than 70% of the users. Technical assistance is generally available in all organizations, though sometimes not easily. 29. The mechanisms for providing information for the database are reported to be fairly country-specific and in many cases still lack established procedures. Obstacles to providing information to the database, beyond the technical and procedural aspects, are the lack of direct Internet connection, frequent staff changes and the lack of capacity. 30. Users foresee about three meeting of the Parties. database, ""Projects"", ""I Espoo cases on average before the second Out of the four service areas of the ENIMPAS ""Research and training"" is not a priority. information on the same WWw.unece.org/env/eia or EIA issues elsewhere EU DGXI homepage) . nstitutions"" and ""Legislation"" are used the most, 6 users out of 15 find better (www.europa.int, 31. Three quarters of authorized users do not specify further obstacles to providing information to the database beyond Internet access and in-country there are no major obstacles to providing information management. Generally, Incentives and overall database relevant information for the database. management are needed for future improvement of the database. J. Other potential users 32. Users provided very limited contact information on potential interested actors on Espoo-related issues. Altogether 8 academic university contacts were mentioned and 3 NGO contacts. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex I Page 8 II. RESULTS OF THE TECHNICAL EVALUATION OF THE ENIMPAS DATABASE WEB SITE 33. The evaluation of the ENIMPAS dtabase includes an assessment of its Internet technology (see annex IV). The Hungarian expert team has conducted a survey of the ENIMPAS Web site from a technical perspective. (The content of the database, the structure, detail, accuracy or credibility of the information stored in the database are not part of this assessment.) A. Methodology 34. The Web site and the technology of the database were assessed according to the following criteria: The database's context on the Internet, and its trends; Accessibility; How fast does the database download, what specific requirements does it have on the user's side and how easy is it to find it through search engines; Database structure; Data structure and performance of the database; Web site design and construction; The Internet technology and design used; Navigation; How easy is it to find a piece of information in the database; Providing input; How can those who have permission enter information into the database. The detailed assessment can be found in annex IV. 35. B. Recommendations 36. The recommendations from the users targeted thr areas: (a) database content, (b) database layout and (c) database management. Database content: 37. Provide more information for the database; Enter in Make ful formation into the database; 1 text search available; Show links to other relevant sites; Put bila Facilita do not develop ENIMPAS into a primary source about and beyo nd. te the practical implementation of the Espoo Conve EIA in Obtain full text legislation with comments for the database; teral and multilateral agreements into the database: ntion, Europe MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex T Page 9 Database layout: 38. “What’s New” should take the user directly to the new item; Show link to Espoo Convention homepage; Show links to national relevant web sites. Database management: 39. Develop and deliver training course on using ENIMPAS; Database manager should assist in entering data into the database; Organize country data managers’ training course. 40. In technical terms, the ENIMPAS database is a well-designed, well- implemented, standard, interactive, on-line database. Its technological solutions are appropriate for its purpose and are functioning well. No real mistakes or errors were found. A few peripheral elements are not yet completed. There are some aspects that can be improved to ensurr accessibility or navigability. better The main recommendations for improvement are: 41. Create a text-only or a combined version of the front page; Improve headings and register in search engines; Improve the information content of front page; Complete missing elements; Improve navigation assistance (add navigation bar). III. OPTIONS FOR THE FUTURE 42. This section was compiled by the lead country of the Evaluation Group based on comments received from the countries involved in the Evaluation Group. 43. The usefulness of the ENIMPAS database is based on two key factors. First, ENIMPAS as an Internet-based database was found to be a proper technical means of contribution to the implementation of the Espoo Convention. Second, the actual content, quantity and quality of the information in the ENIMPAS database were considered to be its main weaknesses. The management system with country data managers and one database manager does not seem to be effective in gathering all the relevant information into the database. So the prestige and the usefulness of the database were considered to be low. 44. The following scenario concentrates on the management and capacity on country-level issues, since the technical aspects of the ENIMPAS database are well established and relatively well managed. 45, The information gathering and provision are centralized and assigned to the database manager. He regularly requests information request from MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex I Page 10 countries, collects this information for the database, and assists to integrate information into the database in terms of both content and (Internet-based) technology. The database concentrates on providing links to other EIA-relevant sites and serves as a meta-database. The database focuses on Espoo projects; training and legislation are of secondary importance. 46. This scenario require countries to be willing to cooperate with the database manager in a timely manner. The database manager must be prepared for the extensive communication and support functions, |11 database manager international funds have to be available to cover al operating expenses. This option is considered viabl Le. and additional MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex IT page 11 Annex II QUESTIONNAIRE - ENIMPAS DATABASE EVALUATION Personal identification 0L X T i o 3 o U (@0iate 1= o B /2= il ¥ o L [0 5 0 Sector government - academic, university - business, consulting - NGO ENIMPAS-related identification Are you aware of the Oslo decision about the database?

The ENIMPAS database is an interactive, on-line Internet database. This means that it is permanently accessible on the Internet, and can be searched for pieces of information in an interactive way, according to several search criteria (countries, keywords, institutions, events, etc.). There are so- called ""privileged users"", who have special permission (password) to feed new pieces of information, or modify earlier ones, in the database. 3. Such databases are relatively common on the Internet. They are widely used in the business, government or NGO sectors, on all sorts of topics. There are standard and customized elements of technology, and many Internet users are familiar with these. 4. From this point of view, an application which is user-friendly, i.e. does not require any special training or skills from its users and is easy to use, should meet the following criteria: S Be accessible with many different Web browsers and computer platforms; S Be accessible by users with poor Internet access, i.e. who use lower capacity computers or have a slow connection to the Internet (low bandwidth, noisy lines, etc.); S Be attractive also to experienced Internet users with fast computers and high bandwidth, who can use and are accustomed to state- of-the-art applications with lots of graphics, moving pictures, sound effects and other special features; S Be easy to navigate, search and feed information into. The primary target group of the ENIMPAS database includes: S Focal points, responsible for the implementation of the Espoo Convention in each UN/ECE country; S Institutions and companies dealing with Espoo cases. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex IV page 20 6. Others who might be interested in the information of the database can therefore be regarded as secondary target groups: w Affected populations and their organizations; EIA experts and students, Other interested parties. even outside the UN/ ECE n region; These target groups represent a very broad range in their technical equipment, quality of Internet access, computer skills and experience. 7. In comparison with other on-line databases, the ENIMPAS database is a well functioning, standard application, and is easily accessible without any special skills or training. IT. ACCI ESSIBILITY 8. In this chapter, the experts looked in more detail at how easily the ENIMPAS database is accessed from different parts of the world and with different technologies. Specifically, they looked at: Downloading speed; Browser compatibility; Accessibil Accessibil lity with poor Internet access; lity through search engines. and A. Downloading speed 9. One key to the success of any Internet service is that it should not require much time to appear on the user's screen. Large files, especially images, and complex pages significantly increase downloading time. they are downloading files from a The information usually The capacity of the line 10. When users access an Internet service, remote computer, which may be on another continent. goes through dozens of computers, so-called gateways. between each gateway, the so-called bandwidth, may vary widely. 11. In this respect, the downloading speed of a specific Internet servic very much depends on where the user is geographically: how many gateways are needed to reach the service's server computer and what is the smallest bandwidth en route. Therefore, the organization providing the service should: Put its service ono a high-capacity server with a high bandwidth; Keep files small. 12. The files on the ENIMPAS database are reasonably small; the use of graphics on the pages is not excessive. A few trace route tests were performed from Hungary and a few other places. These tests, which list the gateways and access speeds step by step en route, gave good results. From this point of MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex IV page 21 view, the accessibility of the ENIMPAS database seems to be fairly good. B. Browser compatibility 13. The target group of the ENIMPAS database includes users with many different computer platforms and software versions. the database should not contain any technical solution which is not supported Thus it is essential that by all browser software. The ENIMPAS database can be used with all graphic browser software. It does not contain frames, features which are not supported by ol java scripts or other special occurs on the front page with text-onl ly platforms, lder software versions. The only problem or with users who have problems downloading images, because the main page contains information and links only on the images. 14. Some of the pages (the thematic search pages) are wide. This causes difficulty for users who do not have high-resolution screens. They are not prevented from using these pages, but it is very inconvenient for them. 15. The browser compatibility of the ENIMPAS database is close to excellent. It could be improved by a text-only version of the front page and by reducing the width of the thematic search pages. C. Accessibility with poor Internet access 16. The UN/ECE region includes countries where Intern even for government officials. and/or low-capacity computers, t access is still poor This means slow and unreliable conn ctions which can run only older versions of software. These people may have serious problems with downloading large files or graphics. Usually these users switch off automatic downl loading of images. 17. The front page of the ENIMPAS database does not have a text-only version, any information or link appears only when the user has downloaded the images. This may be a problem for some users. All of the other pages on the site are well usable without downloading graphics. A text-only main navigation page (front page) would be a good improvement. D. Accessibility through search engines Internet where a user can special services on th 18. Search engines ar enter names or keywords and the engines perform an automated search in millions of Web pages. This is the most effective way of finding information or important sites on certain topics. 19. Admittedly, the primary target groups of the ENIMPAS database, 1i.e. government officials and relevant institutions, are expected to learn about the database in official ways, not by searching the Internet. However, the affected population, its organizations, interested students and experts could make use of information in the ENIMPAS database, if they could find it through search engines. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex IV page 22 20. engi the A few test searches were carried out on three of the largest search nes on the Internet (Altavista, Yahoo and Excite), in order to see whether ENIMPAS database could be found through them. Several combinations of keywords were searched for, thus making general and more specific searches as well The results of the searching tests are shown in the following table: Keywords searched Environmental impact assessment Environmental impact assessment database Environmental impact assessment database transboundary ENIMPAS Result in Altavista Over 1.2 million matches, IMPAS not among he top 200 00 matches, PAS not among top 10 255000 matches, ENIMPAS not among top 100 The only page that appeared was the ENIMPAS Manual page, which is empty (under construction) Result in Yahoo ENIMPAS did not show up among the results ENIMPAS did not show up among the results ENIMPAS not among the top 100 ENIMPAS front page appeared on the top of the list Result in Excite ENIMPAS not among the top 100 matches ENIMPAS not among the top 100 matches ENIMPAS not among the top 80 matches The only page that appeared was the UN/ECE secretariat (Bulletin board, which is empty 21. The occurrence of the ENIMPAS database in search engines is very poor. It could easily be improved by including relevant keywords in the title headings of the pages and by manual registration in the major search engines. This is not a requirement to achieve the main goal of ENIMPAS, but could greatly increase its contribution to professional information on the Internet. ITI. DATABASE STRUCTURI 22. A database contains comparable pieces of information that are stored in a specific format and structure. This makes searching, updating, combining and processing information much more effective. With an electronic database data are stored in a computer, and if it is accessible on the Internet, it is an on-line database. 23. Designing and building the structure is the most important part of the ENIMPAS database, and the one which requires the most programming expertise. The main categories of the ENIMPAS database are: countries; projects; institutions; ©pieces of legislation; research and training events. 24. The structure and the construction of the database, inasmuch as can be seen from a user's perspective, seem perfect. Different searches hav compatible outputs. Cross linking between projects, institutions, countries, MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex IV page 23 legislation, research and training events, and between the English and Russian versions works well. 25. On the page for searching by country, the only mistake found was in the country data: the dates of ratification and coming into effect on the main Convention page (http://www.mos.gov.pl/ENIMPAS-db/legislation?leg text id=23) seem to be updated (although the ""last modification date"" on the bottom of the page is not), but those data do not appear on the search pages by legislation. 26. The data structure of the ENIMPAS database is appropriate for its purpose and is performing well. III. WEB SITE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 27. The design and construction of a Web site covers aspects like how the information is broken into separate pages, how graphics are used, the quality and functionality of graphic elements, the use of colours and their function, the coherence of the layout of separate pages, how attractive the pages are, the layout of pages, how navigation is facilitated among the pages, how general information is provided. 28. Web design is very much a matter of taste. There are no standards which can be used as universal references. However, from a practical point of view, some benchmarks can be useful. 29. As the main purpose of the ENIMPAS databse is to provide professional information (and not entertainment, for instance), the Web site should primarily be functional and easy to use. Its attractiveness is secondary. The ENIMPAS Web site has a good solid design. However, it uses many different background images and title graphics, and this may not be advantageous: 1its decreases identification with the whole site and generates unnecessary extra traffic. 30. The front page aims to be attractive with its picture composition. However, all the information and further links are on the images. For the user, who does not automatically downl] connection, screen. for instance), load images (because of a slow not a singl le piece of information appears on the 31. The information content of the first page is weak. It says ""Database on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context"", and has the UN/ECE-EIA logo. This may not tell all visitors enough. On the other pages, visited links, not-yet-visited links and underlined text appear in exactly the same way. This might be confusing for users. 32. Several items on the ""General information"" page are empty, such as ""The UN/ECE secretariat bulletin board"" and the ""ENIMPAS manual and related documents"", which are linked. Probably, the first one is due to the lack of input from the secretariat, but this is not obvious. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex IV page 24 33. The ""What's New"" page gives a good searching possibility for projects and research/training sessions entered into the database within the past year. A ""© by Authors"" note is placed at the bottom of each page, just below the main content of the page. This may be misleading, as it is not clear what the copyright refers to. 34. The design of the ENIMPAS Web site is simple and functional. A more homogeneous design could better connect the separate pages, but this is partly a question of taste. 35. The front page could be significantly improved in the following two ways: A text-only version, or a combined solution, would make it possible to access the database by those who do not download images. This is especially recommended, since none of the further pages requires the use of graphics; Some explanation of the role of UN/ECE and the Espoo Convention could prevent misunderstandings; so could a brief description of what kind of information from what sources can be found in the database. 36. On the ""What's New"" page an explanation or even a link to projects that are older than one year (but maybe still open) could help visitors to find what they did not find there. 37. If the ""© by Authors"" note was in the first column on the left, below the small ENIMPAS logo, some misunderstandings could be prevented. V. NAVIGATION ON THE EB SITE 38. The navigability of a Web site refers to how easy it is to get to the relevant page, how clear it is on each page where the users are within the site, and how clear it is what they will find on the site and what they will not. It is very important that users always know what they can find on the Web site and where. To assist in this, Web sites usually include a navigation bar on each page, or at least a ""back"" button, or a site map. 39. The ENIMPAS Web site is relatively small and not very complicated. Navigation starts from the front page. On each of the other pages, a small ENIMPAS logo links back to the front page. No other navigation tools are used. 40. Because all links from the front page are on the images, navigation is possible only after downloading the large graphic images. Most links point to an interim page (an html file), which then immediately takes the user to another (shtml) one. As a result, clicking on the ""back"" button in the browser does not take the user back to the previous page, but after a few seconds the user ends up on the same page again. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex IV page 25 41. There is no ""New search"" button on the search pages, although this would be very helpful in many cases. 42. In general, navigation on the ENIMPAS site is fairly straightforward. It could nevertheless be improved by: Adding an alternative text-only or a combined version of the front page; Adding a navigation bar on each page; (c) Excluding the interim html pages between the front page links and the real shtml pages; Adding a ""New search"" button on the search pages. VI. PROVIDING INPUT 43. National focal points for the Espoo Convention, and maybe some other ""privileged"" users, have special permission to enter or change information in the database. These people have individual passwords, with which they can access the input forms. The input forms run on a secure server; this ensures that the passwords cannot be stolen. The input forms can be accessed only with the Netscape browser; Microsoft Internet Explorer cannot be used. 44 . A four-page, illustrated manual was prepared by the ENIMPAS operators. It describes in detail how one can enter or change data in the database. With this manual, providing information is simple, no special technical skills or training is required. The input forms are simple and easy to use. Text can be typed in or copied and pasted from another file. Additional HTML formatting (character and paragraph formats) is possible for those who are familiar with the html code setting. 45. After the completed forms are submitted, the information is not automatically published, but goes to the operators, who check it before forwarding it to the database. This ensures that no fake or accidentally entered information is published. Only those who entered a piece of information can change it later. 46. One issue was raised about providing input. It is a policy question rather than a technical one. Until |l a project is entered into the database by its country of origin, the affected countries are not able to enter their data on that project. This kind of access issue may need to be revised at the policy level. A proposed technical | improvement is to marked the fields of ""obligatory text"" in the input forms more strikingly. MP.EIA:/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex V page 26 Annex V Database on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context EVALUATION REPORT ON USE, COST—EFFECTIVENESS AND POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS 1.Poland was responsible, during the trial period of two years — until the Second Meeting of Parties in 2000 in Sofia - for the maintaining and functioning of the Database for the EIA in a Transboundary Context. The financial support necessary to accomplish this task was provided wvia the Secretariat of the Convention in Geneva or directly by the supporting countries. Poland agreed to act as a lead country for the following main tasks related to the database: a) The database must be made accessible on the Internet on the server of the Polish Ministry of Environment. b) Poland will ensure the proper administering of the database and provide the technical staff support necessary for operating the database. 2. The database ENIMPAS, set up in Poland in accordance to the decision I/5 taken at the First Meeting of the Parties in Oslo was made available via Internet in June 1998, although its demo version was available a few months earlier. Befor the Meeting the information about the logging on as an Authorised User and the short self-tutor guide has been distributed among the interested parties. 3. The database is available at the following two Internet addresses: The first one (http://www.mos.gov.pl/enimpas/) allows for a public access and does not require any logging: it allows for surfing throughout the database and eventually to write an e-mail to the database administrator. The other one (http://www.mos.gov.pl/auth/enimpas-db/) is for the restricted access and available for authorised users only, 1i.e.: database administrator, database content administrator, country data managers, and other authorised users. 4. It was also decided that during the trial period, the operation of the database will be monitored and evaluated by an Evaluation Group (led by Hungary) and the results will be presented at the Second Meeting of the Parties in Sofia. Information required from the Parties to the Convention 5. Parties to the Convention were asked to provide the Database with the following information related to its activities regarding the implementation of the Espoo Convention: a) Information relating to the project likely to cause a transboundary effect - In the case of party of origin the following information is required: project title, type of activity, key words, brief description of the project, MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex V page 27 proponent institution name, competent authority, affected countries list and time frames of the procedure. In the case of affected party: date of notification, date of confirmation, decision of the affected party whether it intends to participate in the procedure, description of the environment of the affected party, forecasted characteristics of impacts, date of completing public consultations and affected country comments. b) Information relating to the institutions, such as Focal Point for the implementation of the Convention, Contact Point for Notification, project proponent institutions, etc. - name of the institution, type of the institution, responsible administrator name, postal address, address of WWW home page, phone and fax numbers and e-mail address of the responsible person. c) Information relating to a legal acts such as national EIA act, bilateral or multilateral agreement, etc - name of the legal act, type of the legal act, key words, list of the countries, which have signed, ratified and/or implemented an agreement or the legal act, description (or full text) of the legal act or its text divided into sections. d) Information relating to research & training in the field of EIA - date when information was entered, date after which the information is not wvalid, title of a publication, name of a subject, training course or conference, key words, type of information (1. Assistance Projects on EIA, 2. Training Courses in UN/ECE Countries on EIA, 3 Research Initiatives, 4. Main Publications on EIA, 5. Conferences and seminars), country submitting information, proponent institution, description. 6. The Database, provided that it will be constantly fed with actual information and properly administered, should constitute: an archive of projects processed under Espoo Convention, a uniform archive of legal acts pertinent to EIA (national and international), an address directory of environmental authorities as well as persons and institutions involved in the transboundary EIA, platform of communication between Focal Points from the different countries, source of “good examples” (for environmental administration), source of methodological information (for experts engaged in EIA), O 0 o W source of an authorised information (for media & general public), Database management 7. The Database 1is made available on the server of the Polish Ministry of Environment 1in the professionally maintained computer centre that 1is well protected against intruders. Constantly upgraded capacity of Internet lines allows for comfortable and efficient access to the database from any other site located in any country. 8. The responsible persons for the operation of the Database are: (i) The database administrator: his task 1is the everydays care for a correct functioning of the database, specifically: checking up for correct format and entering new or modified data to the MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex V page 28 database from user buffer or from disks sent by users of stand alone version (consulting with the database content administrator in any case of doubt), providing for translation of all the documents arriving in only one language and entering them to the database, taking care of the formal content and integrity of the database, generating new versions of the database onto disks for MS-Access and sending them to the users, who have no access to the Internet, servicing users requests sent via e-mail, answering them, resolving their problems in entering data, providing them with short instructions on the best use of EnImpAs capabilities, training and instructing of Country Data Managers on the best use of EnImpAs capabilities. acting as moderator in the discussion lists provided by means of publicly available EIA forum (with a help of the database content administrator, if needed) , administering networking available in the authorised version of the database, management of privileged users’ access rights, collecting arriving information on the necessary changes to the structure and content of the database, reporting to the Bureau of the Convention. (ii) The database content administrator duties may include consultation of submitted data. (iii) Technical consultant is responsible for the following tasks: administering of server (and all installed software) in the Internet computer network, care on the periodical backups of the database resources, accepting by e-mail upgrades of EnImpAs pages & files, aiding in the database recovery after crash, monitor security measures in the site. (iv) Country data manager: one person in each country nominated by the Focal Point for the Implementation of the UN/ pertinent to her/his country. ECE n Convention administering the data MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex V page 29 Funds allotted 9. To perform the tasks Poland received the following funding: In 1998 9800 USD granted by the Government of Italy In 1999 18000 USD granted by the Government of Germany 10. Additionally, in 2000 the Government of Denmark granted 9000 USD. Accordingly to the work plan above funds were thought to cover expenses up to June 2000, the Government of Poland has covered remaining expenses from July 2000 up to February 2001 and partially covered costs of the Course for Country Data Managers held in Warsaw in February 2000. The first instalment Poland received in May 1999 wvia Secretariat in Geneva, the second one in January 2000 directly from the donor Country. Incentives by the database management 11. In the following of the First Meeting of the Parties to the Convention the database administrator entered the data relating to the Focal Points from all countries-signatories and other institutions as obtained from the Secretariat of the Convention. 12. Polish programmers added also ""UN/ECE Documents Discussion List"" designated for authorised users. An authorised user, e.g. Focal Point can enter her/his intervention that will be attached at the end of the discussion on the selected document. The discussion list in the actual form will eventually be expanded into “networking” capability allowing for groups of authorised users to communicate on subjects of interest. 13.",N/A,14. The database administrator personally contacted by phone and e-mail Focal Points and CDMs in the different countries offering his aid in entering the data to the database. In September 1999 a short self-tutor guide have been prepared and distributed among parties to the Convention. In the same time the database authors completed a comprehensive manual of the database and sent it for translation.,"15. The Focal Points identified the following three main reasons why they are not entering the data to the database: The Department 1is currently busy with other tasks and the Espoo related activity 1is treated at low priority. This situation will change soon and DA should expect a bigger interest paid to the database from our side. The Department actually has problems with availability of the personnel sufficiently skilled in computer and Internet applications. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex V Materials that are to b ntered to the database are currently available in the local language and we need time to have them translated. 16. Starting from the summer 1999 the database administrator started to introduce to the database information of research initiatives and training courses, on conferences and seminars and on the literature, as found in the internet and from other sources. 17. In February 2000 a three-day training course for Country Data Managers has been organised in Warsaw by the Ministry of Environment. The programme of this course covered the following subjects: W W W W S In Introduction: (Espoo convention, role of EnImpAs in the transboundary EIA), Information relevant to the transboundary EIA (legislation, project, procedure, methodology, expertise, training), Data structures of EnImpAs, Basics on Internet & World Wide Web, A solid ¥ day course of practical use of html language, Tutorial: (entering legal act, entering project data, entering research & training data, modification of above, introducing of a privileged user, cancellation of a record of data, participation in the discussion list) Network security the course participated 20 persons from 15 countries. During the course the manual in English and Russian languages have been distributed. The Database manager has added the following data and information: S Environmental Impact Checklists for all the activities listed in the Appendix of the Convention (in Research and Training: Assistance Projects on EIA) inks to the UN/ECE pages and documents as well as to other sites containing nformation useful for the transboundary EIA I On-line helps on database pages (in English and Russian) L i 5 'he loadable file containing the Notification Form (in the database for authorised users) 5 [he table from the report prepared by Finland and Sweden describing practical implementation of the Convention Some smaller modifications to the descriptions and labels on database pages, accordingly to the suggestions made by users. Usage of the database 19. During the first period the Parties to the Convention have entered no real data to the database. The questionnaire prepared by the Hungarian evaluation group showed that the parties to the Convention are parties of origin of a few dozen of projects. Similar conclusions emerge from the Draft Report: Practical application of the UN/ECE Convention on EIA in a Transboundary Context prepared by Finland and Sweden (November 1999) showing that not less than 35 projects have been initialised accordingly to the Espoo procedure. However, only few of these projects have been entered by the correspondent Parties to the database. MP.EIA/WG.1/2000/12/Rev.1 Annex V 20. Up to 10 of June 2000 Country Data Managers have entered 7 projects, being processed under the provisions of Espoo Convention. Moreover 16 records of the category Research and Training have been added as well as 25 legal acts and 122 records on institutions. The quantity and quality of information started to grow as a result of the training course for the Country Data Managers. 21. At present the database EnImpAs does not include many information and therefore its usefulness is limited. The Evaluation Report prepared by the group of experts led by Hungary points out this fact. This excellently prepared professional report is in the opinion of Polish Database management an objective and useful tool for the future database improvement and Poland in general shares its findings and conclusions.",07/27/2000,2000_420156,Poland,N/A,yes

[The formulation of the definition is irrevocable.] Option 1b: Forest definitions for each forest type or biome occurring within the Party’s boundaries. 2. Parties may choose to use several definitions of forest to account for different forest types in their country in accordance with their national circumstances. The definition(s) must be used consistently in the first [and subsequent] commitment period[s]. [The formulation of the definition(s) is irrevocable.] Option Ic: Use of the FAO definition as in the IPCC Special Report, with Party-specific thresholds for forest cover, tree height and minimum area. 3. For the purpose of applying Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol, the definition of a forest is: land with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than [Party to select a threshold of between 10 and 25] per cent and area of more than /Party to select a threshold of between 0.5 and 1] hectares (ha). The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of [ Party to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5] metres (m) at maturity in situ. [A forest] may consist either of closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground; or open forest formations with a continuous vegetation cover in which tree crown cover exceeds [Party to select a threshold between 10 and 25] per cent [, extending over an area of more than [Party to select a threshold between 0.5 and 1 ha]]. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes which have yet to reach a crown density of [Party to select a threshold between 10 and 25] per cent or tree height of [Party to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5 metres] m are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest. Option 2: Definitions and thresholds determined by COP Option 2a: FAO definition with universal thresholds for forest cover, tree height, and minimum area. 4. For the purpose of applying Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol, the definition of a forest is: land with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than [COP to select a threshold of between 10 and 25 to be applied by all Parties] per cent and area of more than [COP to select a threshold of between 0.5 and 1 to be applied by all Parties| hectares (ha). The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of [COP to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5 to be applied by all Parties] metres (m) at maturity in situ. [A forest] may consist either of closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground; or open forest formations with a continuous vegetation cover in which tree crown cover exceeds [COP to select a threshold between 10 and 25 to be applied by all Parties] per cent [, extending over an area of more than [COP to select a threshold between 0.5 and 1 ha to be applied by all Parties]]. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes which have yet to reach a crown density of [COP to select a threshold between 10 and 25 per cent to be applied by all Parties] per cent or tree height of [COP to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5 metres to be applied by all Parties] m are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest. Option 2b: Forest definition for each biome (international level) The COP/MOP requests the IPCC to develop definitions of a forest appropriate to each forest biome. Annex I Parties shall designate biomes to the lands within its boundaries and apply the associated forest definition as developed by the IPCC to each biome in order to determine eligible activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. Such designation shall be applied consistently during the first and subsequent commitment periods. The designation of biomes to the land is irrevocable, unless a change in vegetation or biome warrants a new designation. In cases where a Party alters the designation of biomes to the land, such changes shall be reported in accordance with Article 7 and reviewed in accordance with Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. Afforestation 5. “Afforestation” is the conversion of non-forest to forest on land that has not historically' been forested. Reforestation 6. “Reforestation” is the conversion of non-forest to forest on land that historically was forested, but that has been converted to non-forest. Re-establishment of the forest through planting, seeding and natural regeneration following harvesting will [not] be considered reforestation. Meaning of “historic” - Distinction between afforestation and reforestation 7. For purposes of defining afforestation and reforestation for the first commitment period, “historic” is considered to mean since 1 January 1990 [the last ... years]. Deforestation 8. “Deforestation” is the conversion of forest to non-forest, which is not immediately followed by the establishment of the same forest type on the same site. ' For the definition of “historic”, see paragraph 7. Is forest harvesting considered deforestation? 9. Reductions in forest cover as a result of harvesting or other practices which occur as part of ongoing forestry practice are not considered deforestation under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol. 10. In cases where re-establishment of forest following harvesting takes place in the next commitment period, Parties shall provide information in accordance with Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol, to distinguish acts of harvesting from acts of deforestation. Such information will be reviewed in accordance with Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. Size of the assessment unit 11. For the purposes of determining the area of deforestation to come into the accounting system under Article 3.3, Parties shall determine canopy cover for each forested area within their borders for areas no greater than 10 ha [1 km?] [10 km?]. Revegetation 12. Revegetation is defined as human-induced activities that establish woody vegetation that covers a minimum area of 0.5 ha and does not meet the definitions of afforestation and reforestation in Article 3.3 and/or human-induced activities to increase carbon stocks on sites with minimum vegetation cover and low organic matter content. 13. Acts of revegetation include: Establishment of windbreaks and shelter belts; (a) Establishment of native vegetation; (b) Agroforestry planting of trees and the development of new tree crop products; (©) Changes in stock management and other practices to encourage regeneration; (d) Seeding or planting of legumes and grasses. (e) Forest management 14. Forest management is considered to include a combination of individual management activities related to multiple uses and services. Managed forests do not include parks, wilderness areas, wildlife preserves or other forests that are inaccessible. Carbon sequestration is one of the multiple functions of sustainable managed forests. Forest management activities are defined with the objectives to meet goals set by the forest owner. Cropland management 15. Cropland management includes practices on land on which agricultural field crops are grown and on land that is considered cropland but is not being used for crop production. Grazing land management 16. Grazing land management comprises practices aimed at manipulating the amount and type of forage and livestock produced. Grazing land includes lands on which the primary productive use is for livestock or other herbivore grazing. It can include lands such as natural pastures (native pastures), native hay, rangelands and drained peatlands. Grazing land management includes activities related to manipulating the amount and type of forage and livestock produced, such as forage species selection, fertilization, irrigation and drainage. B. Eligibility | Eligibility 17. For Atrticle 3.3, eligible activities are those that meet the requirements set forth in this decision and that have taken place on or since 1 January 1990 or in a year subsequent to 1990, but before the end of December of the last year of the commitment period. 18. Implementation of land-use, land-use change and forestry activities included under the provisions of Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol shall be consistent with the objectives and principles of the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Ramsar Convention, the Rio Forest Principles, and Agenda 21. Inclusion of eligible activities under Article 3.4 in the second and subsequent commitment periods Option 1: Inclusion of all activities for second and subsequent commitment periods 19. All [human-induced] activities, and their associated changes in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, other than afforestation, reforestation and deforestation shall be counted under Article 3.4 in the second and subsequent commitment periods. Option 2: Approve a limited list of additional activities for second and subsequent commitment periods 20. The following human-induced activities, and their associated changes in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, other than afforestation, reforestation and deforestation shall be counted under Article 3.4 in the second and subsequent commitment periods: [revegetation], [forest management], [cropland management], [grazing land management], [forest aggradation and degradation], [agroforestry], [establishment of urban greening], [control of forest fires and pest outbreaks]. Option 3: Establish a process to determine the inclusion of activities 21. A proposal was made to establish, prior to the fixing of quantified objectives for the second commitment period, a list of agreed additional activities for use in the second and subsequent commitment periods, together with the rules, modalities and guidelines for their accounting. Inclusion of eligible activities under Article 3.4 in the first commitment period Option 1: No additional activities unless scale, uncertainty, and risk issues resolved 22. No additional activities shall be pursued under the provisions of Article 3.4 during the first commitment period, unless the COP decides that the issues of scale, uncertainty and risk related to the sinks are resolved (see also paragraphs 34 to 35). Option 2a: Apply all approved activities 23. During the first commitment period, Parties may choose to account for net changes in GHG emissions from all additional Article 3.4 activities listed in paragraph __ above, for the second and subsequent commitment periods. Option 2b: Selected list to be applied by all Annex I Parties 24. During the first commitment period, the following activities shall be included by all Annex I Parties as additional human-induced activities under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol: (specify the activities. This should be a subset of the list of additional activities that may be applied in the second and subsequent commitment periods). Option 2¢c: Party chooses which activities it applies 25. Parties shall report in accordance with Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol, before the start of the first commitment period, which changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from additional activities it elects to add to, or subtract from, its assigned amount during the first commitment period. Such activities shall be limited to those, or a subset of those, listed in paragraphs 19 and 20 above. Such a decision is irrevocable. C. Accounting Accounting 26. Subject to paragraphs __ (insert those paragraph numbers determining the eligibility of activities), for the first commitment period, the adjustment to a Party’s assigned amount shall be equal to the net changes in CO, greenhouse gas emissions, measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and net changes in non-CO; emissions during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 resulting from land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3 since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink, this value shall be added to the Party’s assigned amount. Where the result of this calculation is a net emission, this value shall be subtracted from the Party’s assigned amount. 27. If an area of land is subject to Article 3.3 activities as well as Article 3.4 activities, it shall be accounted for under Article 3.4. Initiation of accounting during the commitment period 28. Accounting of net changes in carbon stocks and non-CO, greenhouse gas emissions resulting from land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3 shall begin with [the onset of the activity or] the beginning of the commitment period [, whichever comes later]. Duration of accounting 29. Once land is accounted for under Article 3, all changes in GHG emissions and removals occurring from this land must be accounted for over subsequent and contiguous commitment periods. Carbon pools 30. Parties shall account for changes in carbon pools associated with land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, which shall include: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon, and harvested wood products from deforestation activities, in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as required by Article 5.2, any future updates of (parts of) these Guidelines and, possible future good practice guidance to be developed by the IPCC on land-use, land-use change and forestry. 31. Parties shall account for all carbon pools that are a source of GHG emissions as a result of land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, but may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period if transparent and verifiable information in provided that demonstrates that the pool in question is not a source. Non-CO; gases 32. Non-CO, emissions and/or removals, and verifiable changes in carbon stocks resulting from land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3 shall be estimated, reported, and accounted for in accordance with methodologies agreed to by the COP, and any additional methodologies that may be agreed to by the COP and the COP/MOP at future sessions as a result of methodological work on inventory guidelines, good practice guidance and uncertainty management. Separating out the natural uptake from human-induced effects on lands that are subject to land-use and forestry activities but that have not undergone a land-use change since 1990 Option 1: No separation 33. Changes in GHG emissions or removals as a result of direct human-induced activities, non-direct human-induced activities, and natural processes (extreme weather events, fire, pest invasion, El Nifio cycles, CO, and nitrogen fertilization) shall be accounted for together on each area of land where an eligible activity has taken place. Option 2: Separation 34. Only greenhouse gas removals from additional agreed land-use and forestry activities which can be shown to have a detectable direct human-induced effect on carbon stocks, shall be accounted for under the provisions of Article 3.4. This requirement shall be tested using verifiable statistical data to show that the hypothesis that the activity has no detectable human-induced effect, can be rejected with 10 per cent significance; 35. Accepted statistical tests and modeling techniques [to exclude carbon stock changes in all ecosystems caused by climate change, elevated carbon dioxide concentration and the effects of fertilization due to nitrogen fallout,] [to separate the direct human-induced effects from other effects,] shall be used singly or in combination to test the criterion referred to in paragraph 34. Such tests and techniques shall be based on data and information from: (a) Control plots used for comparison between land subject to the activity and land not subject to it; (b) Data from research plots; Data from research plots; Existing forest survey and planting data collected in the last 10 years. (©) 36. Deterministic model projections shall be used to factor out the dynamic effects of age structure in forest ecosystems. 37. Where such models, tests and techniques are not used, changes in carbon stocks associated with agreed activities shall only be applied if the rate of uptake exceeds 0.5 tonnes C/ha-yr for forest land and 0.1 tonnes C/ha-yr for grassland.’ 38. Crediting of carbon stock increases due to human activities shall not exceed the net increase in carbon on lands affected by the actions. Limiting debits and credits from Article 3.3 for all commitment periods 39. For the first commitment period, additions to a Party’s assigned amounts as a result of reforestation activities, will be limited to reforestation occurring on those lands that did not contain forest in 1990. 40. Debits resulting from harvesting in the first commitment period [and other natural and human-induced effects] following afforestation and reforestation since 1990, shall not be greater than credits earned from sequestration on that unit of land. Conditional “netting-out” of afforestation, reforestation and deforestation area g 41. A proposal was made that the area counted as deforestation during the first commitment period might be reduced by areas of afforestation and reforestation with the same or greater potential carbon content. > The natural uptake of cropland can be considered negligible. Limiting credits from Article 3.4 for the first commitment period Option 1: Limitation on credits using a ceiling 42. During the first commitment period, verifiable increases in carbon stocks associated with any agreed activities shall only be accountable under the provisions of Article 3.4 up to [X] per cent of the assigned amount. Option 2: Limitation on credits using a discount rate 43. During the first commitment period, only 5 [X] per cent of the verifiable increases in carbon stocks associated with agreed activities [all activities/specified activities/activity Y] shall be accountable under the provisions of Article 3.4. Option 3: Limitation on credits using a threshold 44. During the first commitment period, only verifiable increases in carbon stocks in excess of [a threshold level of X tonnes C/ha-yr] [0.5 tonnes C/ha-yr] associated with agreed activities [all activities/specified activities/activity Y] shall be accountable under the provisions of Article 3.4. Option 4: Limitation on credits using a country-specific threshold 45. During the first commitment period, a Party may add to its assigned amount only the positive net removals in excess of the threshold [specified for that Party] [formula based on country-specific data and information]. Option 5: Limiting credits to address uncertainty 46. Changes in carbon stocks under Article 3.4 shall be adjusted for uncertainty in a conservative way by debiting or crediting carbon stock changes at the lower bound of the absolute value of the 95 per cent confidence interval. Article 3.7 47. A single pre-commitment period review process should apply to all elements of a Party’s inventory, including all emissions and removals associated with land-use change and forestry. The eligibility of a Party to apply the final sentence of Article 3.7 shall be based on a complete, reviewed inventory. For calculating the initial assigned amount, all greenhouse gas emissions associated with land-use, land-use change and forestry, in CO; equivalents, shall be taken into account. 48. The meaning of the final sentence of Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol is that Parties for whom land-use change and forestry constituted a net source of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 shall include their aggregate anthropogenic emissions minus removals from land-use change in their greenhouse gas inventory for the base year and subsequent years. 49. Emissions from land-use change, for the purpose of the implementation of Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol, are those net emissions reported under the forest and grassland conversion and abandonment of managed lands subcategories of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines. 50. Since Parties to which the final sentence of Article 3.7 applies will already have counted the effects of activities related to land-use change agreed under the provisions of Article 3.3 and Article 3.4 as part of their base year and subsequent inventories, further accounting of these activities under the provisions of Article 3.3 and 3.4 would not apply to these Parties. D. Measuring and reporting 51. Areas of land under Article 3.3 and 3.4 shall be identifiable via guidelines on the national inventory system under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol. 52. Net changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions and removals shall be [in line with the requirements of Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol] [measured, estimated, monitored and reported, with associated uncertainties, in a manner consistent with the inventory guidelines adopted by the COP, or those to be adopted by the COP following methodological work by the IPCC and/or the COP, and any good practice guidance and uncertainty management adopted by the COP], [and the requirements for supplementary information agreed to by the COP/MOP under the provisions of Article 7.1 of the Kyoto Protocol.] 53. Depending on the choices made in paragraphs 1-4, one of the following options needs to be included. Parties shall provide information on [the source and suitability of their definitions] [the designation of biomes to the lands and the applied forest definitions] [the elected thresholds for forest cover, tree height, and minimum area] in accordance with Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol [prior to the first commitment period]. [The definitions] [This information] [The choice of thresholds] shall be reviewed in accordance with Article 8 of the Protocol.",09/26/2000,2000_425809,Poland,N/A,yes

We recommend that item be considered directly in the plenary meeting. Pursuant to rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly we attach an explanatory memorandum (annex I)",N/A,Signed) Vladimir C. Sotirov,"Minister Plenipotentiary Chargé d’affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Bulgaria to the United Nations (Signed) Walter Balzan Ambassador Permanent Representative of Malta to the United Nations (Signed) Janusz Stanczyk Ambassador Permanent Representative of Poland to the United Nations (Signed) Peter Tomka Ambassador Permanent Representative of Slovakia to the United Nations (Signed) Ernest Petri¢ Ambassador Permanent Representative of Slovenia to the United Nations A/55/238 Annex | Explanatory memorandum Solidarity was recognized in the United Nations Millennium Declaration (General Assembly resolution 55/2) as one of the fundamental values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century. The Declaration also states that global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice and that those who suffer most or who benefit least will receive help from those who benefit most. Founded 20 years ago, the “Solidarity” social movement, whose significance for the world has been acknowledged, notably in the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to its legendary leader, Lech Walesa, and which was indeed based on solidarity ideals, became a great driving force for change, not only in Poland but also in the broader context, which ultimately toppled the Berlin Wall and led to the revival of democracy behind the Iron Curtain. This movement also contributed to directing the attention of people on all continents to the increasing importance of solidarity as an essential value in relations between individuals, peoples and nations. Solidarity is not only a requirement of a moral nature, but also a precondition of the efficiency of the policies of individual countries and peoples. It is one of the guarantees of peace in the world. We are living in a period of widening gaps between the rich and the poor. Authentic progress will not be possible without cooperation between all nations and peoples in overcoming poverty and without solidarity with the have-nots. We must take a positive responsibility for those who cannot assure themselves of sufficient resources for development, whose human rights are not observed and whose dignity is not respected. They are our common concern. Let the twenty-first century, therefore, be an age of nations, peoples and individuals committed to solidarity. The lonely road leads inescapably to isolation. Supranational structures, founded precisely on the principle of solidarity but respecting local distinctiveness and cultural diversity, hold out the prospect of full and stable development. The proclamation of 31 August as the International Day of Solidarity, coinciding as it does with the anniversary of the birth of the “Solidarity” movement, which inspired and paved the way to the aforementioned changes, would help to promote and strengthen the ideals of solidarity as values essential to relations within and among nations, peoples and individuals. The proclamation of this day would contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. Solidarity has various dimensions and finds shape in various planes, which is why the proposed resolution of the General Assembly indicates the possibility of commemorating the day in a variety of ways and by a variety of means according to local, regional and international needs. A/55/238 Annex I1 Draft resolution Proclamation of 31 August as the International Day of Solidarity The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 55/2 of 8 September 2000, entitled “United Nations Millennium Declaration”, in which it recognized solidarity as one of the fundamental values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century, Reaffirming its conviction, as it has been expressed by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, that global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice, Mindful of the need for the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, Emphasizing the importance of solidarity as a moral means of establishing a just and lasting peace in accordance with the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,! Recognizing the role of solidarity in the strengthening of international cooperation and mutual understanding, Recalling that on 31 August, twenty years ago, the independent “Solidarity” movement was born in Poland and, being based on solidarity ideals, proved to be an important driving force for change that ultimately in an international plane toppled the Berlin Wall and led to the revival of democracy behind the Iron Curtain, Being aware that only when nations, peoples and individuals base their relations on solidarity ideals, humanity might be saved from wars, bridging the gap between the rich and the poor will be facilitated and respect for human rights and dignity enhanced, 1. Proclaims 31 August as the International Day of Solidarity in order to promote and strengthen the ideals of solidarity within and among nations, peoples and individuals; 2.
