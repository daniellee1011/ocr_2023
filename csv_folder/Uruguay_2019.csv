consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, and that the specific nature of indigenous peoples and rural and local communities can aggravate their vulnerability, as they can be located in isolated areas without communication access or network support, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples are among the first A/HRC/40/L.22/Rev.1 to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Taking note of the report of the

humanitarian settings,’ and the report of the Secretary-General on child, early and forced marriage,” Welcoming also the United Nations Population Fund-United Nations Children’s Fund Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage, and other ongoing United Nations activities and programmes on child, early and forced marriage, noting regional, national and subnational instruments, mechanisms and initiatives to end child, early and forced marriage, including the African Union Campaign to End Child Marriage, the Model Law on Eradicating Child Marriage and Protecting Children Already in Marriage developed by the Southern African Development Community, the Regional Action Plan to End Child Marriage in South Asia (2015-2018), the Kathmandu Call for Action to End Child Marriage in South Asia, the Kigali Declaration adopted by national human rights institutions from Commonwealth countries, the Joint Inter-Agency Programme to End Child Marriage and Early Unions in Latin America and the Caribbean, and further encouraging coordinated approaches to action at all levels, Welcoming further the recent progress made globally towards ending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease in the proportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the past decade from one in four to approximately one in five, while expressing concern that, despite this global trend, progress has been uneven across regions and that the current pace of change is not sufficient to fulfil the commitment under target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, Expressing concern that in some countries and contexts, rates of child, early and forced marriage are rising, and that every year at least 12 million girls are still married before they reach the age of 18, Recognizing that, while child, early and forced marriage primarily has an impact on women and girls, boys and men can also be subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and expressing concern that an estimated 1 in 30 boys marry before they reach the age of 18, Recognizing also that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Recognizing further that addressing child, early and forced marriage requires a holistic human rights-based approach, with interventions focused on preventing and ending harmful practices, and on changing social norms and attitudes that underlie the practices, and with special attention paid to and the meaningful involvement of those who have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage, Noting with concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage is highly exacerbated in humanitarian settings by various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, the use of forced marriage as a tactic in conflict, lack of access to education, the stigma of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruptions in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates, abuses and impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls and harmful practices, including female genital mutilation, and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, 1 A/ARC/41/19. 2 A/73/257. A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal values, discriminatory gender norms, stereotypes, perceptions and customs that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, and deeply concerned also that poverty, insecurity, lack of access to education and health services, and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of this harmful practice, and that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, play an essential role in changing negative social norms and confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations and feminist groups, Recognizing also the need to support girls and women who are subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and recognizing further the importance of ensuring the autonomy of these women and girls and their access to social services, counselling, shelter, education, lifelong learning and vocational training, to formal employment and economic independence for women and economic empowerment for girls , to adequate health services, information and education, including for sexual and reproductive health, mental health, psychosocial support and rehabilitation services, to nutrition, housing, clean water, sanitation and hygiene, and to justice, legal services and services that protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, and recognizing that such provisions are all necessary for the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and intimate partner violence, Deeply concerned that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma related to menstruation, and social norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities is one of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities, and the active participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives, and remains an impediment not only to the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development of society as a whole, and that investing in the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, as well as strengthening their voice, agency, leadership and full, effective and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty, and are critical for, inter alia, sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women, to enter and advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 and the investment in women’s and girls’ development is a priority in and of itself, has a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing further that women and girls generally share the experience of being worse off economically than men and boys, and that often women and girls experience significantly higher declines in income and increased dependence on social welfare and other informal assistance, after dissolution of marriage, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and _ possible retribution, Recognizing that the criminalization of child, early and forced marriage alone is insufficient when introduced without complementary measures and support programmes, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of and the loss of livelihoods for the families affected, and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of informal unions or unregistered marriages, Recognizing also that everyone, including men and boys, benefits from the achievement of gender equality and that the impacts of gender inequality, discrimination and violence against women and girls, including child, early and forced marriage, are borne by society as a whole, and emphasizing, therefore, that men and boys, by taking responsibility themselves and working jointly in partnership with women and girls at all levels, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and ending this practice, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-responsive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable, disaggregated data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Recognizing that the registration of births, marriages, divorces and deaths is part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve sustainable development, and that the absence of compulsory registration of customary and religious marriages is a major impediment to the implementation of existing legislation and other initiatives to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, 1. Recognizes that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, and that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, and that every girl and woman at risk of or affected by these practices must have equal access to quality education, counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services and medical care; 2. Urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution and to address their specific needs, such as through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender- A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 based violence, including domestic and intimate-partner violence, increase their decision- making power and financial literacy, make it easier for women to seek formal employment and increase their economic independence, improve women’s and girls’ access to education, skills development programmes, vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities, ensure their equal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 3. Also urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, protecting those at risk, including in humanitarian settings, and supporting women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses and that women have equality with men in all matters pertaining to marriage, divorce, child custody and the economic consequences of marriage and its dissolution; 4. Further urges States to remove any provisions that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims, in particular by repealing or amending such laws; 5. Calls upon States to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages; 6. Also calls upon States to develop and implement measures at all levels to end child, early and forced marriage, including national and subnational action plans where appropriate, and to make adequate resources available across relevant sectors, including health, nutrition, protection, governance and education; 7. Further calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school because of, inter alia, marriage, pregnancy and/or childbirth, on re-entry policies and on vocational training and skills development, which empower young women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate, age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, with information on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 8. Calls upon States to ensure that married and/or pregnant adolescents and young mothers, as well as single mothers, can continue and complete their education, and in this regard, design, implement and, where applicable, revise educational policies to allow them to remain in and return to school, providing them with access to health-care and social services and support, including childcare and breastfeeding facilities and créches, and to education programmes with accessible locations, flexible schedules and distance education, including e-learning, and bearing in mind the important role and responsibilities of fathers, including young fathers, in this regard; 9. Urges Governments to respect, protect and fulfil the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 and reproductive health, through the development and enforcement of policies and legal frameworks and the strengthening of health systems, including health information systems, that make universally accessible, acceptable and available quality, gender-responsive, adolescent-friendly health services, sexual and reproductive health-care services, information, education and commodities, HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, treatment and care, mental health services and psychosocial support, and nutrition interventions and prevention, treatment of and care for obstetric fistula and other obstetric complications by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care; 10. Calls upon Governments to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all women and girls, including those who have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and to adopt and accelerate the implementation of laws, policies and programmes that protect and enable the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including reproductive rights, in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences; 11.

obligations, Expressing profound concern at the backlash against progress made by States, international and regional organizations and civil society, including women’s and community-based organizations, feminist groups, women human rights defenders, trade unions and girls’ and youth-led organizations, to respect, protect and fulfil all human rights, and recognizing that these retrogressions can be linked to economic crisis and inequality, retrogressive lobbies, political views or misuse of religion to oppose the struggle for women’s and girls’ equal rights, Recognizing

Development Goals are acknowledged in the 2030 Agenda, and recalling further the importance of achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, including by reducing pollution and ensuring special attention to the needs and rights of all women and girls, children and people with disabilities, Recalling also that Sustainable Development Goal 5 calls for the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls and, specifically, for ending all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere and eliminating all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation, Recalling further the designation, pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 47/193 of 22 December 1992 and 67/291 of 24 July 2013, of 22 March as World Water Day and 19 November as World Toilet Day, which are important opportunities to promote, among other issues, awareness of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and of the remaining challenges in this regard, Recalling the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of June 1992 and its resolution 66/288 of 27 July 2012, entitled “The future we want”, and emphasizing the critical importance of water and sanitation within the three dimensions of sustainable development, Taking note of the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Affirming the importance of continually improving the availability of high- quality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggregated data on progress related to safe drinking water and sanitation services as an indispensable means for States to plan for, implement and monitor the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all without discrimination, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2019 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, '? and noting the fact that it has an extensive global database and has developed global norms to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures very often do not fully capture all the dimensions of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Taking note of the fact that, globally, between 2000 and 2017, according to the Joint Monitoring Programme, the percentage of the population using safely managed drinking water increased from 61 per cent to 71 per cent and the percentage of the population using basic drinking water services decreased from 20 per cent to 19 per cent, and welcoming the fact that the percentage of the population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 per cent to 45 per cent and the percentage of the population using basic sanitation services increased from 28 per cent to 29 per cent, Deeply concerned that, almost 10 years after the adoption of resolution 64/292, 785 million people still lack basic drinking water services and 144 million people still collect water directly from surface water sources, representing a combined 11 per cent 3 World Health Organization/United Nations Children’s Fund, Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: Special Focus on Inequalities. 2019 updates and SDG baselines (Geneva, 2019). 3/8 of the world population, while 2 billion people still lack basic sanitation services and 673 million people still practise open defecation, representing a combined 26 per cent of the world population, Deeply concerned also about the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services and its dramatic consequences for the overall health situation in humanitarian crises and emergencies, including in times of conflict and natural disaster, acknowledging that people living in countries affected by conflict, violence, natural disasters and the adverse effects of climate change, as well as people living in refugee camps in refugee host countries, are more likely to lack access to basic drinking water and to basic sanitation than people living in unaffected countries, Deeply concerned further that women and girls often face, especially in humanitarian crises and emergencies, including in times of conflict or natural disaster, particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation, as well as menstrual hygiene management, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water and of care responsibilities, including those arising from waterborne diseases, in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, such as education and leisure, or, for women, for earning a livelihood, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children the hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old and that, in humanitarian crises and emergencies, including in times of conflict or natural disaster, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are accessible and appropriate to their needs, which restricts their ability to safely utilize public spaces, engage in social activities and participate in education or, for adults, employment, which is particularly concerning for persons with disabilities in situations of displacement, homelessness or humanitarian crisis, Deeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilian objects, injuring personnel and cutting off the power that keeps water, sanitation and hygiene systems running, and by the fact that children under 5 living in conflict zones are 20 times more likely to die from diarrhoeal disease related to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene than from violence in conflict, Deeply concerned that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and education thereon, are excluded and stigmatized, that their health can be negatively impacted, and that they are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned also that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education and the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recognizing that women have specific hygiene needs during menstruation, pregnancy, childbearing and rearing and throughout the life course, Deeply concerned further that women and girls are particularly at risk and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open 4/8 defecation and urination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, Deeply concerned that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively affect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and _ that, according to the annual United Nations World Water Development Report, over 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater, and over 95 per cent in some developing countries, is released into the environment without treatment, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, recalling that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, and recalling also the need to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, Recognizing that, while the implications for the enjoyment of human rights related to environmental damage and climate change-related impacts are felt by individuals and communities around the world, the consequences, especially those related to the lack of basic drinking water, are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, such as people living in informal settlements, and that the specific situation of indigenous peoples, people living in small island States and rural and local communities can aggravate their vulnerability and recognizing also that indigenous peoples may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, 1. Reaffirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, are essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights; 2. Recognizes that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 3. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note of his reports; 4. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and to endeavour to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical cooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures; 5. Calls upon States: 5/8 (a) To ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and to marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds; (b) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, ‘4 including the Goal on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, consistent with their obligations under international law and taking into consideration the guiding principles of the New Urban Agenda, which envisages cities and human settlements that fulfil their social function, the full realization of the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, without discrimination, and universal access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation; (c) To ensure access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all women and girls, as well as for menstrual hygiene management, including for hygiene facilities and services in public and private spaces; (d) To take measures to empower women, including women with disabilities, for preparedness in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of conflict or natural disaster, by implementing gender-responsive policies, plans and programmes that address menstrual hygiene and secure the necessary resources for its effective management, including access to water and sanitation services, and adequate disposal options for menstrual products, without compromising women’s safety and dignity; (e) To address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by promoting educational and health practices in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and by ensuring access to factual information thereon, including for men and boys, addressing the negative social norms around the issue, as well as ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender-sensitive facilities, including disposal and waste management options for menstrual products, while recognizing that women’s and girls’ attendance at school, university or, for women, work, can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, public places and, for women, the workplace; (f) To promote both women’s, including young women’s, leadership and their full, effective and equal participation in decision-making at all levels on water and sanitation management at the household, community, utility and government levels, and to ensure that a gender-responsive approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes; (g) To reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education, including through improved public services and infrastructure; (h) To promote safe public spaces and improve the security and safety of women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and infrastructure when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or practising open defecation and urination; 4 Resolution 70/1.

Calls upon States and international organizations to provide financial resources, help capacity-building and technology transfer to help countries, in particular developing countries, to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all; 7. Calls upon non-State actors, including business enterprises, both transnational and others, to comply with their responsibility to respect human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, including by cooperating with State investigations into allegations of abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and by progressively engaging with States to detect and remedy abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 8. Calls upon State and non-State actors to recognize water as a vital resource, and emphasizes that the access to water resources and installations must be protected in humanitarian crises, including during conflicts, in accordance with applicable international legal frameworks; 9. Stresses the important role of the international cooperation and technical assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, urges 7/8 development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and invites regional and international organizations to complement efforts by States, upon their request, to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation in accordance with their respective mandates; 10.

3/8 are more likely to lack access to basic drinking water and to basic sanitation than people living in unaffected countries, Deeply concerned further that women and girls often face, especially in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation, as well as menstrual hygiene management, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water and of care responsibilities, including those arising from waterborne diseases, in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, such as education and leisure, or, for women, for earning a livelihood, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children the hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years old, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation and that, in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, Deeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are accessible and appropriate to their needs, which impacts on their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is particularly concerning in the situation of homelessness, as well as in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilian objects in armed conflict, which may injure personnel and cut off the power that keeps water, sanitation and hygiene systems running, Deeply concerned that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and education thereon, are excluded and stigmatized, that their health can be negatively impacted, and that they are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned also that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education and the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recognizing that women have specific hygiene needs during menstruation, pregnancy, childbearing and rearing and throughout the life course, Deeply concerned further that women and girls are particularly at risk and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, Deeply concerned that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively affect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and _ that, according to the annual United Nations World Water Development Report, over 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater, and over 95 per cent in some developing countries, is released into the environment without treatment, Affirming the importance of regional and international cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to 4/8 safe drinking water and sanitation, with the understanding that it has no bearing on the issues of international water law, including international watercourse law, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling the need to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island States and rural and local communities, and

legislation and international agreements, and therefore recognizing the important contribution of the promotion and protection of the safety of journalists in this regard, Mindful that the right to freedom of opinion and expression is a human right guaranteed to all, in accordance with article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that it constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and development, Acknowledging that journalism is
