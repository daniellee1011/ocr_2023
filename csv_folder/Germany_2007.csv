Such an agreement would be deposited with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and endorsed in a Security Council resolution. To create the right conditions for negotiations, We will: «Commit to support actively the building of new light water reactors in Iran through international joint projects, in accordance with the IAEA statute and NPT. «Agree to suspend discussion of Iran’s nuclear programme in the Security Council upon the resumption of negotiations. Iran will: «Commit to addressing all of the outstanding concerns of IAEA through full cooperation with IAEA. ¢ Suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities to be verified by IAEA, as requested by the IAEA Board of Governors and the Security Council, and commit to continue this during these negotiations. «Resume the implementation of the Additional Protocol. Areas of future cooperation to be covered in negotiations on a long-term agreement 1.

psychotropic substances,"The Commission on Narcotic Drugs, Recalling the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988,! in particular article 12, which lays down the principles and mechanisms for the international cooperation and control of substances frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, hereinafter referred to as “drug precursors”, Noting with satisfaction the increasing number of parties to the 1988 Convention, and mindful of the immense effectiveness of drug precursor control in disrupting the illicit manufacture of and illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, Alarmed by the number of stopped shipments and_ seizures of amphetamine-type-stimulant precursors, as reported by the International Narcotics Control Board, Concerned by the constantly changing modus operandi of diversion and illicit trafficking in drug precursors involving changing methods of drug manufacture with recourse to new or different chemical substances and new trafficking routes, Concerned in particular by the continued threat of diversion of ephedra (as plant material or in processed form) which is being targeted by traffickers with the aim of using it in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine, Concerned also by the increased threat of diversion of phenylacetic acid, the precursor of 1-phenyl-2-propanone, which is the essential chemical substance frequently used in the illicit manufacture of amphetamine and methamphetamine, Recalling its resolution 49/3 on strengthening systems for the control of precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of synthetic drugs, in which it emphasized the physical and psychological damage caused by synthetic drugs, especially methylenedioxymethamphetamine (commonly known as “ecstasy”), methamphetamine and amphetamine, Alarmed that large numbers of diversion attempts involving considerable amounts of ephedra (as plant material or in processed form) in all regions of the world, as well as alarming increases of diversion attempts involving 1-phenyl-2-propanone and phenylacetic acid, have been reported by the International Narcotics Control Board, Recalling General Assembly resolution 59/162 of 20 December 2004 on follow-up on strengthening the systems of control over chemical precursors and preventing their diversion and trafficking, in which the Assembly recommended that Member States develop or further adapt regulatory and operational control procedures to counter the diversion of chemical substances into illicit drug manufacture and reaffirmed the importance of using all available legal means or measures to prevent the diversion of chemicals from legitimate trade to illicit drug manufacture as an essential component of comprehensive strategies against drug abuse and trafficking and of preventing access to chemical precursors by those engaged in or attempting to engage in the processing of illicit drugs, Recognizing that regulatory and law enforcement authorities should exercise heightened vigilance in the monitoring of international trade in ephedra (as plant material or in processed form) and phenylacetic acid, Stressing that drug precursors and other substances used for illicit drug manufacture, especially ephedra (as plant material or in processed form), are being trafficked on a global scale, involving most regions of the world and requiring border control authorities to exercise specific heightened vigilance, Concerned that trafficking organizations may be turning to the use of non-controlled substances, involving also the use of derivatives and/or substitute chemicals, to replace controlled substances in illicit drug manufacture in order to circumvent controls, Noting the increased complexity of globalized trade and the rapidity of trade flows with different sectors of industry involved, as well as operators along the supply chain, including intermediaries involved in those transactions where the substances do not physically enter the territory where the intermediaries are located (drop shipments), Recalling article 12, paragraph 9 (a), of the 1988 Convention, which underlines the importance of cooperation between competent authorities and different industries in the identification of suspicious transactions, E/CN.7/2007/L.7/Rev.1

whether voluntary, administrative or legislative, in cooperation with the chemical industry to prevent diversion from licit channels, Recognizing that competent authorities, as well as relevant sectors of industry and relevant operators along the supply chain, need to be made aware of the use of those non-controlled substances in the illicit manufacture of drugs and the relevant diversion patterns and cooperate in order to be able to quickly respond to changing patterns and to identify suspicious transactions, Stressing that such comprehensive strategies also require different degrees of measures, namely fully enacted legislative measures that should principally focus on drug precursors essential to the drug manufacturing process, as well as flexible, voluntary monitoring systems to complement the legal requirements, focusing on non-controlled substances, in particular those substances with common licit uses that are traded in very high quantities and that are easily replaceable, in order to allow regulatory and law enforcement authorities, as well as industries, to quickly respond to changes in diversion patterns, Recalling Economic and Social Council resolution 1993/40 of 27 July 1993, Recalling also Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/29 of 24 July 1996, in section I of which the Council called upon, inter alia, the International Narcotics Control Board, to establish a limited international special surveillance list of non-scheduled substances, and section II of that resolution, entitled “Recommendations for action”, and the requests made in that section to the International Narcotics Control Board, which were subsequently fulfilled, in close cooperation with Member States, Concerned that non-controlled substances, including derivatives and/or substitute chemicals, found in illicit drug laboratories differ depending on the State, therefore requiring, in addition to further development of the limited international special surveillance list and recommended actions, voluntary cooperation instruments at the national level, Recognizing the important role of precursor analysis laboratories as part of national drug control systems and

proclaimed the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, and all resolutions on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief adopted by the General Assembly and by the former Commission on Human Rights, Recalling also article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant human rights provisions, Reaffirming the call of the World Conference on Human Rights upon all Governments to take all appropriate measures in compliance with their international obligations and with due regard to their respective legal systems to counter intolerance and related violence based on religion or

religion, Reaffirming also the recognition by the World Conference on Human Rights that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, Recalling the 2005 World Summit

individuals and groups based on religion or belief, the situations of violence and discrimination that affect many women as a result of religion or belief and the abuse of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other relevant instruments of the United Nations, Noting that a formal or legal distinction at the national level between different kinds of religions or faith-based communities may, in some cases, constitute discrimination and may impinge on the enjoyment of the freedom of religion or belief, Underlining the importance of education in the

Further emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if limitations are prescribed by law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, and are applied in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; 14. Recommends that the United Nations and other actors, including non-governmental organizations and bodies and groups based on religion or belief, in their efforts to promote freedom of religion or belief, ensure the widest possible dissemination of the text of the Declaration, in as many different languages as possible, and promote its implementation; 15.
