Takes note of the reports of the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (E/CN.4/2004/47 and Add.1 and 2), and stresses that structural adjustment reform programmes have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Recognizes that the structural adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, imposing fixed expenditure ceilings, and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 3. Expresses its concern at the fact that the options for macroeconomic policy of developing countries are constrained by demands for adjustment and that many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still carry very high external debt burdens relative to their gross national product; 4. Also expresses its concern that the majority of countries that reached the intermediate phase under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debt Initiative have yet to reach the final stage and that even for countries meeting all the criteria, the Initiative may not result in a sustainable debt burden; 5. Recognizes that for the heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers in the forms of grants and concessional loans, as well as removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 6. Regrets that up till now there has been little headway made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor within them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms; 7. Acknowledges that a lot of progress remains to be achieved towards a lasting solution to the debt problems of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, and that in several low- and middle-income countries unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals regarding development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 8. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals set out in the Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 9. Recalls, once again, the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 10. Calls upon the international community, including the United Nations system, and the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the World Conference on Human Rights and the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, and in this regard stresses the need: 10. (a) To implement speedily, effectively, fully and with continued flexibility with respect to the eligibility criteria the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which should be fully financed through additional resources, taking into consideration, as appropriate, measures to address any fundamental changes in the economic circumstances of those developing countries that have an unsustainable debt burden caused by natural catastrophes, severe terms-of-trade shocks or conflict, taking into account initiatives which have been undertaken to reduce outstanding indebtedness; (b) To encourage exploring innovative mechanisms to comprehensively address the debt problems of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries and including middle-income countries and countries with economies in transition; 11. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration contained in the annex to resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 11. 12. Also recalls the conclusion of the statement on poverty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001, that some of the structural obstacles confronting developing States’ anti-poverty strategies lie beyond their control in the contemporary international order and that it is imperative that measures be taken urgently to remove these global structural obstacles, such as unsustainable foreign debt, the widening gap between rich and poor, and the absence of an equitable multilateral trade, investment and financial system; otherwise, the national anti-poverty strategies of some States have limited chance of sustainable 12. SUCCESS; 13. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven, with the participation of people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the national context, priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of 13. human rights; 14. Also stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 14. 15. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting the 15. ongoing programmes; 16. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 16. 17. Requests the independent expert to further explore, in his analytical annual report to the Commission, the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 17. 18. Also requests the independent expert, in the discharge of his mandate, to general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure that compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as provided for in the international human rights instruments, and to present a preliminary on this matter to the Commission at its sixty- first session and a final at the sixty-second session of the 18. Commission,; 19. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to carry out his functions; 19. 20. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 20. 21. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 21. 22. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 22. 23. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay particular attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 23. Decides to continue the consideration of this matter at its sixty-first session under 24. the same agenda item.",04/08/2004,2004_519295,Nigeria,"22 April 2003, * In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council.",yes

Also reaffirms that while all democracies share common features, there is no one model of democracy; therefore we must not seek to export any particular model of democracy; 4. Affirms that the consolidation of democracy requires the promotion and protection of all human rights for everyone, both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development; 5.

with religion, Bearing in mind the work of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on the issue of terrorism and in this context noting with concern that the reports of the

express request by the Sub-Commission, 1. Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, regardless of their motivation, in all their forms and manifestations, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed, as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening the territorial integrity and security of States, destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State; 2.

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1.

Pursuant to Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations, the treaty was registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations. Membership ECOWAS is made up of the following 15 member States of West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo. Aims and purpose The creation of ECOWAS arose from the determination to accelerate the economic and social development of the States of West Africa through effective cooperation. To that end, ECOWAS has as its principal aim the integration of the national economies into an economic and monetary union. This involves the promotion of cooperation and development in all fields of economic activity, particularly agriculture, natural resources, commerce, monetary and financial questions, and social and cultural matters for the purpose of raising the standard of living of its peoples, increasing and maintaining economic stability, fostering closer relationship among its members and contributing to the progress and development of the African continent. Institutions of ECOWAS The work and activities of ECOWAS are carried out through the following structures: Authority of Heads of State and Government, Council of Ministers, Executive Secretariat, ECOWAS Parliament, ECOWAS Court of Justice, ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development, West African Health Organization, West African Monetary Agency, and technical and specialized commissions (covering all sectors and meeting at both the senior official and ministerial levels). Activities, achievements and cooperation with the United Nations The creation of an economic and monetary union has involved ECOWAS countries in various regional programmes aimed at market, monetary, physical, production and political integration. The market integration programme led to the establishment of West Africa as a free-trade area in January 2000, accompanied by a regional transit arrangement for goods; a common external tariff is to be introduced in January 2005 as the next step towards a customs union. Free movement of persons within the region has been achieved and member States have adopted common ECOWAS passports and travel certificates. A common currency is being created on a gradual basis through the establishment of a second monetary zone by July 2005, which is to be merged later with the existing CFA franc zone. A regional payments arrangement exists and an ECOWAS travellers cheque has been introduced. A/59/232 ECOWAS physical integration programmes have led to the development of a network of trans-West African highways and a regional system of telecommunication links. In the field of energy, a West African power pool is being created which involves the coordinated generation, transmission, distribution and marketing of power from conventional, new and renewable sources of energy. In the real sector, ECOWAS is promoting public/private partnerships to create a conducive business environment. This involves assistance to regional professional bodies of the organized private sector in organizing such events as regional trade fairs, industrial forums and buyer/seller meetings for promoting joint ventures and trans- border investments. ECOWAS has played a pioneering role in the developing world with the establishment of a mechanism for regional peace and security. The ECOWAS mediation and peacekeeping operations entity (ECOMOG) helped to resolve the civil conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and Cote d’Ivoire. A regional early-warning system and a high-level mediation organ form part of the ECOWAS conflict-prevention mechanism in operation in West Africa. Over the years, ECOWAS has developed very close working relations with the United Nations system. The active involvement of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) led to the creation of ECOWAS, and since then ECA has supported key programmes, including the rationalization of West African intergovernmental organizations. ECOWAS involves the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the International Trade Centre and the World Trade Organization in its trade development programmes. United Nations Industrial Development Organization assisted in the formulation of an ECOWAS regional industrial master plan and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is involved in the adoption of a common agricultural policy and a regional food security programme for West Africa. The International Telecommunication Union is an active partner in the modernization of the regional telecommunications system; similarly, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization are involved in the ECOWAS environment programmes. The World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund participate in the social and cultural cooperation programmes (health, education, culture, gender and child protection). The United Nations Development Programme (particularly its Regional Bureau for Africa) and the Security Council have been involved in the ECOWAS economic integration and regional security initiatives, respectively. Conclusion It is the hope of ECOWAS that its desire to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations is shared by all members of the General Assembly and that a decision will be taken at the fifty-ninth session inviting ECOWAS to participate in the session and work of the General Assembly in the capacity of observer.
