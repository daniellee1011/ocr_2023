The International Solar Alliance, an initiative of India and France, was founded in 2015 at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris. In the Paris declaration regarding the launch of the Alliance, the shared vision of bringing clean, affordable and renewable energy within the reach of all was expounded. It set for the members the mission to mobilize more than $1 trillion in investments for the mass deployment of affordable solar energy by 2030. The then Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, attended the ceremony in Paris, on 30 November 2015, at which the Alliance was launched. Establishment of the International Solar Alliance 2. The international steering committee of the International Solar Alliance, established at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, deliberated on and finalized the framework agreement on the establishment of the Alliance and the institutional framework of the Alliance and its secretariat. The agreement was opened for signature at the twenty-second Conference of the Parties, in 2016, and entered into force on 6 December 2017 in accordance with article XIII of the agreement, with the Alliance acquiring the status of a treaty-based international organization. Subsequently, the framework agreement was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. The founding conference of the International Solar Alliance, held on 11 March 2018, saw the adoption of the “Delhi Solar Agenda”, in which the parties to the framework agreement reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 4. The framework agreement provides that the seat of the International Solar Alliance shall be in India. The Alliance signed a headquarters agreement with the Government of India on 26 March 2018 in which the international legal personality of the Alliance was recognized, consistent with article X of the framework agreement. Article X also provides that, in the territory of each member State and subject to its national laws and the conclusion of a separate agreement, if necessary, the Alliance may enjoy the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent discharge of its functions and programmes. Subsequently, after transferring all assets and liabilities to the first Assembly of the Alliance in October 2018, the international steering committee of the Alliance ceased to exist pursuant to article XIII of the framework agreement. Institutional and organizational structure Assembly 5. The Assembly of the International Solar Alliance, which was established under article IV of the framework agreement and includes representatives from each member State, is the chief decision-making body of the Alliance. The Assembly takes all necessary decisions on the implementation of the agreement and on coordinated action to be taken to achieve its objectives. It is chaired by the President and co-chaired by the Co-President, both elected by the Assembly for a term of two years. The President and the Co-President are supported by eight Vice-Presidents, two each from the four geographical regions of the Alliance — Africa, Asia and the Pacific, 5/20 A/76/192 Europe and others, and Latin America and the Caribbean — selected on the basis of seniority in terms of the submission of the instrument of ratifications to the depositary of the Alliance, that is, the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India. 6. The first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held on 3 October 2018. The Assembly adopted a number of significant decisions, including on the programme of work and budget, the approval of the provisional rules of procedure of the Assembly, the appointment of the Director General, a model agreement on privileges and immunities between the Alliance and individual member States, and the approval of the manual of regulations for the Alliance. Subsequent meetings of the Assembly were held in 2019 and 2020, with a special assembly convened in February 2021 to appoint the successor to the then Director General of the Alliance. Currently, India and France are the Co-Presidents of the Assembly. Standing committee 7. The standing committee, established by the Assembly, comprises the President, the Co-President, eight Vice-Presidents, and up to nine additional members who may be appointed in accordance with rule 79 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The standing committee is responsible and accountable to the Assembly and carries out the powers and functions entrusted to it under the rules of procedure, as well as those functions delegated to it by the Assembly. The committee is mandated, inter alia, to consider the programme of work and budget of the International Solar Alliance, to substantiate the approved programme of work, to take stock of Alliance programmes, to consider and recommend to the Assembly proposals with substantial financial implications for the Alliance, and to advise the secretariat on any emergent issues, upon request. Regional committees 8. To enhance regional cooperation and collaboration, a regional committee is established by the Assembly, under its rules of procedure, for each of the four regions of the International Solar Alliance. Each regional committee comprises the two Vice- Presidents selected from the region and all other Alliance members from the region. The regional committees are responsible and accountable to the Assembly. The regional committees serve as the forum for the regional coordination of views on matters related to the Assembly. The regional committees are mandated, inter alia, to support the harmonization and aggregation of demand, to review the scope of solar applications for members and to assess the aggregate effect of the Alliance programmes in the region. Secretariat 9. The secretariat is established pursuant to article V of the framework agreement. The members, Assembly and committees of the International Solar Alliance are supported by the secretariat to assist them in their collective work under the agreement and the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The secretariat comprises the Director General, who is the Chief Executive Officer, and other staff, as required. The standing committee of the Alliance has approved the provision of 12 international posts and 20 national posts at the Alliance secretariat, for which recruitment is in process. 10. The secretariat coordinates all programmes, activities and initiatives entrusted to it by the Assembly through the national focal points, appointed by each member State in accordance with article II of the framework agreement. 11. Article VU of the framework agreement provides that partner organization status may be granted to organizations that have the potential to help the International 6/20 A/76/192 Solar Alliance to achieve its objectives. It is specifically stated therein that the United Nations, including its organs, will be the strategic partner of the Alliance. At its first meeting on 3 October 2018, the Assembly requested the secretariat to establish institutional links between the Alliance and the United Nations and authorized the secretariat to apply for observer status for the Alliance in the General Assembly of the United Nations. Membership 12. The International Solar Alliance was established as an alliance of solar-resource rich countries, with its membership open to the 121 States Members of the United Nations that lie fully or partially between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. However, on 3 October 2018, the first Assembly of the Alliance adopted a resolution proposed by India to amend the framework agreement of the Alliance to expand the scope of its membership to all Member States. The amendment entered into force on 8 January 2021 and was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. As of July 2021, 79 States members of the Alliance and 19 other States are expected to ratify the agreement. 13. The current membership of the International Solar Alliance covers a significant proportion of the global population. Moreover, a large proportion of the membership is comprised of the least developed countries and small island developing States that stand to benefit significantly from the programmes and activities of the Alliance. As of July 2021, the following States from the four regions of the Alliance are members: Africa 1. Algeria 2. Benin 18. Guinea 19. Madagascar 20. Malawi 3. Botswana 21. Mali 4. Burkina Faso 22.

Under the Paris declaration of the International Solar Alliance, the Alliance is mandated to promote collaboration and cooperation among its member States in order to lower the cost of solar energy and facilitate the massive and needs-based deployment of solar energy through innovative policies, projects, programmes, capacity-building measures and financial instruments. As an action-oriented organization, the Alliance was established to support and enhance the efforts of the global community aimed at meeting the collective ambition of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on Goals 7 and 13. 15. The International Solar Alliance lends its support to its member States across the three critical areas of energy access, energy security and energy transition. The strategic interventions of the Alliance are aimed at reducing the cost of technology and finance and at facilitating the mobilization of low-cost investment in the solar energy sector. 16. The International Solar Alliance plays the crucial roles of accelerator, enabler, incubator and facilitator of the deployment of clean and affordable solar energy at scale to address those key critical issues. As an accelerator, the Alliance supports the creation of economies of scale in the solar energy sector across its membership and the reduction of transaction costs to lower the cost of deploying solar energy in member States. As an enabler, it supports capacity-building interventions to create a well-qualified pool of human resources talent to drive solar energy programmes in member States. 17. In addition, the International Solar Alliance supports the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory ecosystem across its membership through knowledge creation and exchange. As an incubator, the Alliance supports, through its network of partnerships, the development and adoption of innovative financing and risk mitigation modalities across its membership to attract low-cost private and institutional finance. As a facilitator, it supports member States with developing viable solar energy road maps and integrating these with their overarching energy and climate objectives. Further, the Alliance facilitates the mobilization of finance for solar energy projects. 18. To achieve the vision and mission of the International Solar Alliance, the following guiding principles for members of the Alliance are set down in article II of its framework agreement: (a) Members take coordinated actions through programmes and activities launched on a voluntary basis, aimed at better harmonizing and aggregating demand 9/20 A/76/192 for, inter alia, solar finance, solar technologies, innovation, research and development, and capacity-building; (b) In this endeavour, members cooperate closely and strive to establish mutually beneficial relationships with relevant organizations, public and private stakeholders, and non-member States; (c) For those solar applications for which it seeks the benefits of collective action under the Alliance and on the basis of a common analytical mapping of solar applications, each member shares and updates relevant information regarding its needs and objectives, domestic measures and initiatives taken or intended to be taken in order to achieve these objectives, and obstacles along the value chain and dissemination process. The secretariat maintains a database of these assessments in order to highlight the potential for cooperation. VI. Funding 19. The International Solar Alliance was conceived as a voluntary alliance of sovereign countries with no membership fee. Article VI of its framework agreement outlines the sources of funding, which include voluntary contributions from member States, partner organizations including regional economic integration organizations and the United Nations and its agencies, and the private sector as potential sources of funding for the Alliance. The revenue generated from specific activities, approved by the Assembly, are additional sources of finance for the Alliance. 20. India, the host country of the International Solar Alliance, made an initial contribution of $16 million to the Alliance corpus fund, in addition to its contribution to the recurring expenditure of the Alliance for five years from 2016 to 2021. 21. Myanmar and the Comoros have made voluntary contributions to the corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance. France, the co-founder of the Alliance, has provided initial support through the provision of two experts to the Alliance secretariat, as well as initial support of €50,000 for the programme to enable solar technical centres in member States. In addition, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Australia have made financial and/or in- kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 22. The partner organizations of the International Solar Alliance, such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Union, the French Development Agency, the Climate Investment Funds and the World Resources Institute, have also made financial and in-kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 23. Asof March 2021, the total corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance stood at $33.5 million, with contributions amounting to $17.5 million from the corporate sector. VII. Programme and projects 24. The International Solar Alliance has launched seven thematic programmes since its inception that are dedicated to the deployment of cross-cutting solar energy applications across multiple sectors, including agriculture, health and electricity. The programmes of the Alliance are intended to provide a holistic solution to the triple challenge of energy access, energy security and energy transition through a blend of small-scale off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications and large 10/20 A/76/192 utility-scale projects. The following are the seven thematic programmes of the Alliance: (a) Scaling solar applications for agricultural use. This programme is focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications, including solar water pumping systems, solar energy-based drinking water applications and water, sanitation and hygiene interventions; solar home lighting and other off-grid lighting solutions; and solar energy-based cold storage; (b) Affordable finance at scale. This is an overarching programme dedicated to identifying and promoting innovative financing modalities and risk mitigation instruments to lower the cost of finance in the solar energy sector; (c) Scaling solar mini-grids. This programme is dedicated to promoting the electrification of regions that have yet to establish grid connectivity; (d) Scaling solar rooftop. This programme is dedicated to the promotion of solar rooftop applications for industrial, commercial and government consumers; (ec) Scaling solar e-mobility and storage. This programme is dedicated to promoting e-mobility solutions based on solar energy, solar-powered charging infrastructure and energy storage solutions at scale; (f) Solar park. This programme complements other programmes that are focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications to meet the challenge of energy access. It focuses on deploying large utility-scale ground- mounted solar projects to support member States in integrating solar energy into their energy mix at the speed and scale necessary to meet the challenges of energy security and energy transition; (g) Solar heating and cooling. This programme is dedicated to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the rapidly increasing heating and cooling requirements across the membership of the Alliance. The programme encompasses the industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential sectors. 25. In addition to the thematic programmes, the International Solar Alliance has launched specific sectoral interventions, such as the “ISA CARES” initiative, which is aimed at solarizing the health sector to address the challenge of energy access, with a particular focus on developing and least developed countries. The aim of the initiative is to provide not only solar energy-based electricity but additional infrastructure such as solar-powered vaccine cold chains and mobile health clinics. VIII. Capacity-building programmes 26. The International Solar Alliance has been equally receptive to the capacity- building needs of its member States to develop and manage solar assets, including those to be deployed under its thematic programmes and other initiatives. The Alliance is working to support its members in developing capacity to deploy scaled- up solar applications through the development of a network of technical training, entrepreneurship, research and innovation centres in order to harmonize and deliver training programmes using a network of training facilities that would be recognized across the member States. 27. The Solar Technology Applications and Resources Centre network will facilitate the exchange of best practices and promote knowledge dissemination and capacity- building with regard to solar energy, supporting stakeholders across the full deployment process (including technicians, master trainers, project developers, engineers and policymakers). In addition, the network is aimed at supporting the 11/20 A/76/192 standardization of solar technology applications and supporting collaborative research and development, including with the private sector. IX. Projects in individual countries 28. The International Solar Alliance has launched an initiative, approved at its third Assembly, to facilitate, through technical and financial support, solar energy demonstration projects across 47 least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States of the Alliance — 26 countries from the African region, 12 from the Asia and the Pacific region and 9 from the Latin American and the Caribbean region. 29. The initiative is aimed at deploying projects for developing resilience in the agriculture and health sectors. The selection of projects would be member-driven. As of February 2021, project proposals have been received from 16 member States among the least developed countries and small island developing States, while discussions with the remaining least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States are under way. 30. The goal of the International Solar Alliance is to facilitate affordable access for member States to funding for solar projects. To this end, through a partnership between the Alliance, the World Bank and the French Development Agency, the solar risk mitigation initiative was launched at the twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Although the cost of solar energy is constantly falling, its deployment remains slow in certain emerging markets, notably in Africa, where a belief is held in the private sector that the funding of solar projects entails too many risks. The solar risk mitigation initiative is aimed at reversing this trend. It involves the creation of the following: (a) A technical assistance programme for developing sustainable solar projects (support for planning, resource mapping and electrical sector reform) and the solar deployment guidelines, which help countries to identify clear and stable solar goals; (b) A new procurement platform, which will be launched online and will be used to facilitate and collect solar project bids; (c) Hedging instruments to protect against the financial risks inherent in renewable energy production projects, in order to guarantee the solvency of the suppliers. 31. The International Solar Alliance, in partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, is also facilitating a pilot project for solar-powered food and vaccine cold chain technologies in Nigeria. The project is aimed at demonstrating innovative and low-cost technologies that are run on self-sustaining financial models. 32. The International Solar Alliance has signed an agreement with the African Development Bank to harness solar energy. The basic objective of the joint declaration, as mentioned in the agreement, was to develop a road map to mobilize financing for the promotion of solar energy in prospective African International Solar Alliance member States. 12/20 A/76/192 X. Observer status for the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly 33. The primary objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Accelerating the transition towards a low-carbon economy and boosting investments in infrastructure for renewable energy, notably solar power, is therefore critical to realizing the goals of the Agreement. 34. Accordingly, solar energy is an important constituent of renewable energy as an alternative source owing to its wider availability as well as its affordability. The International Solar Alliance is being established at a time when there is a growing need for renewable energy as an alternative source of energy at both the global and regional levels. 35. The International Solar Alliance is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations sustainable development process and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. The primary goal of the Alliance is to lower the cost of finance and spur investments across the solar supply chain, including in manufacturing, project development and storage. 36. The aims, objectives and activities of the International Solar Alliance as set out in the framework agreement and its activities as reflected in the programmes are relevant to the work of the General Assembly in the area of renewable energy. The Alliance is striving to promote the massive deployment of solar energy globally and thereby provide energy security and promote sustainable development in its member States. 37. The promotion of solar energy in the context of the health infrastructure in developing countries supports the achievement of Goal 3, aimed at ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. 38. The various activities of the International Solar Alliance advance many of the objectives of the Paris Agreement and thus contribute to addressing the challenges posed by global warming. 39. The International Solar Alliance plays an important role internationally in supporting the implementation of several United Nations conventions on climate change and the global climate change agenda in general. The participation of the Alliance in major international meetings involving these issues is often critical for the Alliance to carry out its work and mandate. In addition, the Alliance has the wide- ranging resources and expertise needed to make a significant contribution to all such meetings, dialogues and decisions by helping to shape the global policy dialogue and supporting its implementation on solar energy. 40. Since the entry into force of the amendment to the framework agreement on 8 January 2021, the membership of the International Solar Alliance has been universalized and is open to all States Members of the United Nations. It is expected to expand quickly, giving a boost to the efforts of the Alliance to promote the use of solar energy globally. 41. The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance explicitly designates the United Nations, including its organs, as a strategic partner of the Alliance. Observer status will greatly enhance the ability of the Alliance to achieve its goals. The Alliance will be able to follow the deliberations in the General Assembly closely, to cooperate with United Nations organs, agencies and programmes in the implementation of its programmes and activities and to benefit 13/20 A/76/192 from the United Nations through its network of field offices, experience in programme cooperation with Governments, and extensive resources in the development process. 42. We believe that the International Solar Alliance can contribute positively to the fields of sustainable development, renewable energy and climate change and can enhance the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. 43. Granting observer status to the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly would enable the Alliance to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes on the basis of grass-root level experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. The Alliance is also taking a big step towards addressing issues such as technology transfer, the storage of solar energy, and even financial assistance to member States, along with project layout and project planning measures. 44. Cooperation between the United Nations and the International Solar Alliance has the potential to support progress towards building national capacities to reduce poverty and exclusion, enhancing sustainable human development and achieving nationally and internationally agreed development goals. The initiatives of the United Nations and the Alliance can serve as a powerful tool for addressing the challenges faced by developing countries and accelerating progress towards the Goals, and specifically Goal 7: to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. 45. The International Solar Alliance, through its efforts to bring about just and equitable energy solutions through the deployment of solar energy, is expected to usher in a new era of green energy diplomacy. The granting of observer status to the Alliance in the General Assembly would help to provide for regular and well-defined cooperation between the Alliance and the United Nations that would benefit global clean energy growth and sustainable development. 14/20 A/76/192 Annex IT Framework Agreement on the establishment of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) We, the Parties to this Agreement, Recalling the Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance of 30'* November 2015 and the shared ambition to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than US $ 1000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy, and pave the way for future technologies adapted to the needs, Recognizing that solar energy provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to their peoples, Acknowledging the specific and common obstacles that still stand in the way of rapid and massive scale-up of solar energy in these countries, Affirming that these obstacles can be addressed if solar resource rich countries act in a coordinated manner, with strong political impulse and resolve, and that better harmonizing and aggregating the demand for inter alia solar finance, technologies, innovation or capacity building, across countries, will provide a strong lever to lower costs, increase quality, and bring reliable and affordable solar energy within the reach of all, United in their desire to establish an effective mechanism of coordination and decision-making among them, Have agreed as follows: Article I Objective Parties hereby establish an International Solar Alliance (hereinafter referred to as the ISA), through which they will collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in line with their needs.
