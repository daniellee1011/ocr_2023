human rights obligations and commitments operationally directed at respecting, promoting, protecting and fulfilling human rights, and at preventing human rights violations, Welcoming the commitment of States to leave no one behind, and recalling that the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration, is included as the standalone target 16.9 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable

planning and implementation of programmes and policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that non-governmental organizations, professional associations, the media, the private sector and other members of civil society, including those involved in public-private partnerships, can also contribute to the

Expresses concern at reports that the Syrian authorities are arbitrarily preventing internally displaced persons from accessing and returning to their homes, with no apparently valid security reason and without providing alternatives to the displaced communities, which may amount to forced displacement; 46. Deplores in this regard the existence and application of national legislation, in particular Law No. 42/2018 and other legislation and practices concerning housing, land and property rights, which have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property, as evidenced by recent reports of widespread property demolitions throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, calls for the immediate repeal of that legislation, and stresses the right of displaced Syrians to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it; 47.

Recalls the findings of the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its report of 1 March 2019 that, on the basis of its evaluation and analysis of all the information gathered, there were reasonable grounds that a toxic chemical was used as a weapon in Duma on 7 April 2018, and that the toxic chemical was likely molecular chlorine; 56.

Elimination of female genital mutilation,"The Human Rights Council, Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Recalling the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the optional protocols thereto, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the

contribution to the legal framework for the protection and promotion of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women and girls, Recalling General Assembly resolution 73/149 of 17 December 2018, on intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilation, and all other relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on the Status of Women on measures to eliminate traditional practices that are detrimental to women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, as well as Human Rights Council resolution 38/6 of 5 July 2018 GE.20-09247(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/44/L.20 on the elimination of female genital mutilation and other Council resolutions on the same topic, Recalling also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, Recalling further the commitment made by States to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, Recalling the annual commemoration of the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, on 6 February, with the aim to enhance awareness-raising campaigns and to take concrete action against female genital mutilation, Recognizing that, like all other harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation constitutes a human rights violation and a form of violence against women and girls that is mainly motivated and perpetuated by gender inequality and discriminatory social norms that jeopardize the recognition, enjoyment and exercise of their human rights and fundamental freedoms while posing a serious threat to their health and well-being, including physical integrity and mental, sexual and reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, Recognizing also that the practice has no documented health benefits and may, on the contrary, increase the risk of sickness and death, that it causes severe stress and shock, that it may give rise to post-partum and obstetric complications such as fistula or haemorrhage, and that it is likely to increase vulnerability to HIV and hepatitis B and C and to cause other health problems, Recognizing further that all harmful practices, including female genital mutilation, when perpetrated against girl children, have particular detrimental consequences on their health and growth, and recalling in that regard the need to guarantee the right of girl children to be free from all forms of violence, Recognizing that the practice of female genital mutilation continues to have an adverse effect not on only the economic, legal, health and social status of all women and girls, but also on the development of society as a whole, while the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, the full enjoyment of their human rights and their full, equal, effective and meaningful participation at all levels of decision-making are key to breaking the cycle of gender inequality, discrimination, gender-based violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, to sustainable development, Recognizing also that harmful practices such as female genital mutilation are an impediment to the full realization of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and to the respect for, and protection and fulfilment of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and the development of their full potential as equal partners with men and boys, as well as to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and convinced that such harmful practices seriously impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and human rights and prohibit gender- based discrimination and violence, Deeply concerned that, despite increased national, regional and international efforts, the harmful practice of female genital mutilation, like many other harmful practices, persists in all parts of the world, that it is exacerbated in humanitarian situations, armed conflicts, pandemics and other crises, and that new forms, such as medicalization and cross-border practice, are emerging, Recognizing that the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation is a national development, human rights and public health priority, thereby requiring a comprehensive and multisectoral approach based on States’ obligations under international human rights law and underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, accountability, participation, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, equality and non-discrimination, and international cooperation, A/HRC/44/L.20 Considering that holistic strategies to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation must be mainstreamed and coordinated both vertically and horizontally; that horizontal coordination requires the joint participation of organizations across sectors, including education, health, justice, social welfare, law enforcement, immigration and asylum, and communications and media, while vertical coordination brings together stakeholders at the national, subnational and local levels, including, inter alia, parliamentarians, national human rights institutions, traditional community leaders and religious authorities, women and girls, parents, legal guardians and families, health-care providers, civil society, human rights groups, youth organizations and men and boys, Recognizing that the practice constitutes torture or ill-treatment and must be prohibited, in accordance with regional and international human rights standards, Expressing deep concern about the lack of effective measures for prosecuting perpetrators, providing victims and survivors of female genital mutilation with access to remedies and redress, health care and health services, mental health and psychosocial counselling, legal assistance and socioeconomic reintegration services, Noting that human rights accountability means not only the establishment of protection measures ensuring criminal liability and the provision of legal remedies, but also the implementation of a broad range of other measures in the design, implementation and monitoring of policies, programmes and services to ensure women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights with the full, equal active and meaningful participation of women and girls at risk of and affected by female genital mutilation, Noting with concern that many countries lack accurate and reliable data on female genital mutilation to inform planning and track progress in eliminating female genital mutilation, due to the absence of indicators in administrative data systems, the absence of robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track progress and the absence of standard guidelines on data collection, Bearing in mind the most recent global and national commitments made by States, including in the 2019 Ouagadougou call to action on eliminating female genital mutilation, and the 2019 Cairo call to action for the elimination of child marriage and female genital mutilation in Africa, to accelerate efforts to ensure the global elimination of the practice of female genital mutilation by 2030, Welcoming the growing global consensus on the need to take appropriate measures to prevent and eradicate female genital mutilation, and considering that this practice cannot be justified on religious or cultural grounds, Welcoming also initiatives, such as the Saleema initiative launched by the African Union, to galvanize political action, increase allocation of financial resources and strengthen partnerships to end female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned about studies indicating that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis could drive international, regional and national efforts away from the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation and other harmful practices, which could result in delayed programme implementation and at least 2 million additional cases of female genital mutilation that could have been averted by 2030, Reaffirming the obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and to prevent and eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation, and emphasizing in this regard the specific role of the different departments of government, the legislative branch and the judiciary at the national and subnational levels, Bearing in mind that States have primary responsibility for preventing and eliminating female genital mutilation and for achieving zero tolerance of the practice, A/HRC/44/L.20 1.

Further urges States to ensure that national action plans and strategies on the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation are adequately resourced and include projected timelines for goals and incorporate clear targets and indicators for the effective monitoring, impact assessment and coordination of programmes among all relevant stakeholders and promote their participation, including the participation of affected women and girls, practising communities and non-governmental organizations, in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of such plans and strategies; 5. Encourages States to put in place national coordination mechanisms to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation and ensure their sustainability and effectiveness by recognizing, preferably by law, their convening authority and by providing them with adequate financial resources and capacities so that they can oversee the implementation of comprehensive and multisectoral strategies, national plans, policies and programmes; and mobilize relevant actors, including girls, women, parents, legal guardians and families, women’s organizations, health-care workers, youth groups, human rights groups, religious and traditional leaders, community leaders, men and boys and other members of civil society and national stakeholders as appropriate to participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of national efforts to prevent and end female genital mutilation and provide care for women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation; 6. Also encourages States to integrate the prevention of and response to female genital mutilation into national development plans and poverty reduction strategies through the active participation of all relevant ministries, parliamentarians, the judiciary, national human rights institutions, civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders; 7. Urges States to identify and make available adequate and specifically designated resources to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation across relevant sectors, including health, nutrition, protection, justice, governance and education, for the effective implementation of related policies, programmes and legislative frameworks; 8.

sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights, and resolution 74/141 of 18 December 2019, Reaffirming all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, Council resolution 39/8 of 27 September 2018, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International

the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to the right to life and human dignity, Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that human rights must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the GE.20-12504(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/45/L.28 same emphasis, and that it is the duty of States to promote and protect all human rights, and which also reaffirms the right to development, Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which States pledged to leave no one behind, Recalling that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development covers the issue of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also that 10 years after the recognition of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, integrated approaches that support the practical realization of the human rights to water and sanitation, particularly by tackling inequalities and ensuring special attention to the needs and rights of all women and girls, are more pertinent than ever before, also in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the need to pursue these integrated approaches to the implementation of Goal 6 and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals that reflect the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and personal hygiene, in particular for women and girls, to enable menstrual management in a dignified and healthy way, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water and to reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity, Recalling General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which the Assembly proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, Noting the work of the High-level Panel on Water, jointly convened by the United Nations and the World Bank Group, in order to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation-related services in line with Sustainable Development Goal 6 and taking note of its outcome document of 14 March 2018, Noting also the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2019 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report of the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2019, 1.6 billion people gained access to safe drinking water between 2000 and 2017 and that an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 785 million people lack a basic water service, 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.2 billion people lack access to a safely managed sanitation service and 673 million people still practise open defecation, Deeply alarmed about the fact that, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, scarcity of water could displace an estimated 700 million people by 2030, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and A/HRC/45/L.28 Hygiene has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms by which to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Recognizing that sustained access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities is essential to preventing infectious diseases and that people without or with inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are at a much higher risk of contracting and passing on diseases, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities and that those most at risk are persons in vulnerable and marginalized situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, and gravely concerned that 3 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home, which is the most effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable and marginalized situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island developing States and the least developed countries, rural and local communities and people facing desertification, land degradation, drought and water scarcity, as well as rising water levels due to storm surges, sea level rise and flooding, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water, when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or when, in the absence of adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, which limits their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, A/HRC/45/L.28 Deeply concerned also that persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities, as such facilities are often inaccessible and inappropriate for meeting their needs, which affects their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is further exacerbated in particular in the situation of homelessness, in informal settlements and in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed that water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or during natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability, and reaffirming also the importance of taking steps with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, tenure status, income levels or other related considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of achieving universal access to safe, affordable and adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030 and of adequate and new sources of funding, including innovative financing, Stressing also the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have sustained access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and takes note with appreciation of his reports; 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and_ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the A/HRC/45/L.28 relevant Sustainable Development Goals; urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach that includes menstrual health management when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;_and invites regional and international organizations to complement the efforts made by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in accordance with their respective mandates; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons in vulnerable situations have equal access to effective remedies; 6. Notes with concern that, in spite of all efforts, gender inequalities still exist in the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in particular as a result of women’s and girls’ specific needs concerning menstrual hygiene and menstrual health; 7. Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law; (b) To consider making the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, a priority at the highest level in order to ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability; (c) To increase public funding and support private capital in order to make adequate funding available to the sector and to close the financing gap that hampers the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 and the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; (d) To monitor continuously and analyse regularly the status of the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, to enhance efforts to improve the availability, accessibility, quality and use of water-related data at local, national and regional levels and to develop disaggregated and gender-responsive indicators and monitoring mechanisms; (e) | To promote both women’s leadership and the full, effective, meaningful and equal participation of women in planning, decision-making and implementation on water and sanitation management; to ensure that a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes and that measures are taken to reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education; to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside of their home or practising open defecation; to protect women’s and girls’ equal access to water and sanitation; and to take positive measures to guarantee the availability and accessibility of these rights; (f) To promote safe public spaces and improve the security and safety of all women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and infrastructure when accessing sanitation facilities and water waste collection and treatment facilities outside their homes or when collecting household water; A/HRC/45/L.28 (g) | To enhance international solidarity, cooperation and support for countries hosting large numbers of displaced persons and refugees to address their water- and sanitation-related challenges; (h) To address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by ensuring access to factual information thereon, addressing the negative social norms around the issue in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender- sensitive facilities, including options for the disposal and waste management of menstrual hygiene products, while recognizing that women’s and girls’ attendance at school, university or, for women, work, can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, public places and, for women, the workplace; (i) To take steps to promote action to raise international awareness on the issue of waterborne diseases and to mitigate the disproportionate impact of water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases on children and reduce child mortality, morbidity and stunting by ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and by engaging in partnerships with stakeholders to implement projects aimed at scaling up access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in developing countries; Gj) To take measures to accelerate the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in line with the Sustainable Development Goal 6 global acceleration framework, in particular in the context of responding to and preventing the spread of COVID-19, including by working collaboratively with all stakeholders in a coordinated manner to improve water and sanitation services and by ensuring that water and sanitation systems are resilient and sustainable in order to protect people’s health and support national health systems; (k) | To step up disease prevention efforts by ensuring access to safe, adequate and affordable water and sanitation services for all in public and private spaces; (1) To apply broad and inclusive participatory approaches, consulting and coordinating with local communities and other stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable and non-discriminatory access to adequate water and sanitation services; (m) To provide for effective mechanisms, such as regulation and accountability mechanisms, to ensure that all stakeholders respect and promote human rights and avoid causing or contributing to human rights violations or abuses;

A. 2/10 women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major impediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, as well as economic and political life, Recognizing the special needs and vulnerabilities of women and girls living in areas affected by armed conflict, complex humanitarian emergencies and terrorism and that global health threats, climate change, more frequent and intense natural disasters, conflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related humanitarian crises and the forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent decades and have particular negative impacts on women and girls, especially with regard to their safety from all forms of violence against them, that need to be comprehensively assessed and addressed, Recognizing also that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its impunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for action by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such violence may include stalking, death threats and other threats of sexual and gender- based violence, as well as related trends, against women and girls in digital contexts, such as trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, including unwanted verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women and girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, Alarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, or the gender-related killing of women and girls, including femicides, which constitutes an extreme form of violence against women and girls and the most violent manifestation of discrimination against women and girls and gender inequality, is among the least punished crimes in the world, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including the adoption of a zero-tolerance approach to ending impunity for such crimes, Deeply concerned by the increased violence against women and girls around the world, including domestic violence, intimate partner violence and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child early and forced marriage, including in conflict-affected areas, particularly in the context of lockdown measures and school closures adopted in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Welcoming the innovative policies and initiatives implemented by Governments and civil society in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent and facilitate the reporting of sexual and gender-based violence and to ensure that women and girls can lead lives free from violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination, including through the use of digital technologies and helplines or the mobilization of grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and other service providers to help victims to find safe spaces and support, Underscoring that, often, a lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, persisting impunity, structural discrimination, discriminatory laws, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, insufficient recourse for victims of violence against women and girls, gender stereotyping and negative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as well as negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced income, prevent many women and girls from reporting or acting as witnesses and from seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuse against women human rights defenders and peacebuilders persists owing to various factors, such as a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and 3/10 shortcomings with regard to preventing and addressing sexual and gender-based violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuse, Acknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, and in this regard stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children,!> supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, as well as of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, !° Emphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data, including disaggregated data, on the prevalence, patterns and drivers of violence against women and girls and effective approaches to prevent and respond to such violence impedes efforts to design and implement measures, including, where appropriate, policies and legislation, to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health care and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, Recognizing the need to promote the early, full, equal, effective and meaningful participation of all women and girls and women-led organizations, including victims and survivors of violence, in the conceptualization, development, implementation and evaluation of intersectional gender-transformative policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Stressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in preventing and eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic and intimate partner violence, discrimination and sexual harassment, Deeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of women and girls and their access to education and essential health services, the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during lockdown, are deepening already existing inequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls made in recent decades, Recognizing the need to strengthen the contribution of family members in combating violence against women and girls, bearing in mind that in different cultural, political and social systems various forms of the family exist, 1.

(j) Removing barriers, including political, legal, cultural, social, economic, institutional and religious ones, preventing women’s full, equal and effective participation in leadership and political and other decision-making positions, taking into account that promoting women to leadership positions may significantly reduce the risk of sexual and gender-based violence;

Secretary-General, Welcoming the development of national and subnational action plans and awareness-raising campaigns and the enactment of legislation by several Member States to prevent and respond to school violence and bullying, including cyberbullying, Recognizing that bullying, including cyberbullying, can take both direct and indirect forms, from acts of physical, verbal, sexual and relational violence or aggression to social exclusion, including from peer to peer, which can inflict physical, psychological and social harm, and that, although rates differ from country to country, bullying, online or in person, has a negative impact on the fulfilment of the rights of the child and is among children’s main concerns, affecting a high percentage of children and compromising their health, emotional well-being and academic work, and acknowledging the need to prevent and eliminate bullying among children, Recognizing also that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the greatest global challenges in the history of the United Nations, and noting with deep concern its disproportionately heavy impact, inter alia on children, and its impact on health and the loss of

while expressing concern that the poorest and most vulnerable children are least likely to live in a suitable home-learning environment with an adequate Internet connection and learning support, Deeply concerned that increased unsupervised use of the Internet, inter alia during the COVID-19 pandemic, has exacerbated children’s exposure to the risk of all forms of violence, including in digital contexts, inter alia peer-to-peer sexual harassment and cyberbullying, child sexual exploitation and abuse, child grooming, trafficking in persons, hate speech, stigmatization, racism, xenophobia and discrimination, Recognizing the importance of generating appropriate statistical information and data on bullying, including, whenever possible, cyberbullying, disaggregated by income, sex, age, race, ethnicity, migration status, disability and geographic location and other characteristics relevant in national contexts, Recognizing also that children exercising their right to education, including through digital technologies, should not have their safety affected and should be protected from any violation or abuse of their right to privacy, and in this regard emphasizing that efforts to expand connectivity and digital learning and bridging the digital divide should give special regard to the protection of children, Concerned about the occurrence of bullying in all parts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may be at heightened risk of compromising their health, emotional well-being and academic work and for a wide range of physical and/or mental health conditions, as well as potential long-term effects on the individual’s ability to realize his or her own potential, Concerned also that bullying, including cyberbullying, is associated with long- lasting consequences that continue on into adulthood, Noting with concern that children who are marginalized or vulnerable, who face stigmatization, exclusion or discrimination of any kind, are disproportionately affected by bullying, both in person and online, Recognizing that bullying often includes a gender dimension and is associated with gender-based violence and stereotyping that negatively affects both boys and girls, Noting the risks associated with the use of new information and communications technologies and applications, including increased vulnerability to bullying, while stressing that they can create new ways to enhance education and, inter alia, foster learning and teaching on the rights of the child and can be useful tools to promote children’s protection, including with appropriate guidance from parents and legal guardians, with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration, Noting also the role that information and communications technologies play in reducing the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, including by empowering children to report such abuses, Recalling the obligations of States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to ensure that parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child as well as to take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, 3/6 neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child, and recognizing that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, Acknowledging the distinct and important roles that parents, legal guardians, schools, civil society, sports associations, communities, State institutions and traditional and non-traditional media each play in securing children’s protection from the risks associated with bullying, including cyberbullying, and in preventing all forms of violence, including by promoting children’s online safety, Recognizing that early childhood is a critical stage for cognitive, emotional and behavioural development and that the parent-child relationship is a significant factor in predicting bullying behaviour in adolescents, as well as the existing evidence of a link between domestic violence and bullying in schools and other educational settings, Emphasizing that evidence-based initiatives to strengthen children’s life skills and respect for human rights, tolerance, concern for others and the responsibility to foster safety, as well as whole-school and whole-community programmes that fully respect all human rights and help to prevent and address bullying, constitute best practices that should be developed, strengthened and shared through international cooperation, Acknowledging that children are uniquely placed to inform effective solutions and responses to bullying, including cyberbullying, and underlining that children’s participation and their contributions, including their views and recommendations, therefore need to be at the centre of efforts to prevent and address bullying and that their effective and meaningful participation is critical to a clear understanding of bullying and its impacts in order to effectively address it, 1.

A. 2/10 efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres in all regions of the world, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, and impairs their full enjoyment of, all human rights, Recognizing that women’s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and from the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women and girls impedes the social and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between men and women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major impediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, as well as economic and political life, Recognizing further the special needs of women and girls living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism, and that global health threats, climate change, more frequent and intense natural disasters, conflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related humanitarian crises and the forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent decades and have particular negative impacts on women and girls that need to be comprehensively assessed and addressed, Recognizing that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its impunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for action by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such violence may include stalking, death threats and threats of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as related trends against women and girls in digital contexts, such as trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, including unwanted verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women and girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, Alarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, including gender- related killings of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the world, which constitutes an extreme form of violence against women and girls, is among the least punished crimes, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including in ending impunity for such crimes, Gravely concerned that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, remains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all social strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse or impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, as such, is unacceptable, Stressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in preventing and eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and sexual harassment, Recognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such violence the family can play an important role, 3/10 Deeply concerned by the increased violence against women and girls around the world, including domestic violence, as well as harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child early and forced marriage, including in conflict-affected areas, particularly in the context of confinement measures and school closures adopted in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Taking note of the response plans, policies and initiatives implemented by Governments and civil society in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, and facilitate reporting thereon, and to ensure that all women and girls can lead lives free from violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination, including through the use of digital technologies, media, helplines or the mobilization of grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and other service providers to help victims to find safe spaces and seek support, Underscoring that, often, a lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, persisting impunity, all forms of discrimination, including structural discrimination, insufficient recourse for victims of violence against women and girls, gender stereotypes and negative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as well as negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced income, prevent many women and girls, as applicable, from reporting or acting as witnesses and from seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Acknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, and in this regard stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, '° as well as of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, ""” Emphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data on violence against women and girls, including disaggregated data, and on its prevalence, patterns and drivers, as well as on effective approaches to prevent and respond to it impedes efforts to design and implement measures, including, where appropriate, policies and legislation, to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, Encouraging the removal of all barriers to women’s access to justice and ensuring that they all have access to information about their rights as well as effective legal assistance so that they can make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal proceedings and issues relating to family law, and also ensuring that they have access to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, including formal and appropriate informal justice mechanisms, as provided for by national legislation and, where necessary, the adoption of national legislation, 16 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2237, No. 39574. 'T Resolution 64/293. 4/10 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors such as a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing sexual and gender-based violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, Recognizing the need to promote the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and women’s organizations, including victims and survivors of violence, in the development, implementation and evaluation of gender-responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of women and girls and their access to education and essential health services, the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, are deepening already existing inequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls made in recent decades, 1. Strongly condemns all forms of violence against all women and girls, recognizing that they are an impediment to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and to the full realization of their human rights; 2. Stresses that “violence against women” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, including online, and notes the economic and social harm caused by such violence; 3. Urges States to strongly condemn all forms of violence against all women and girls, and reaffirms that they should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination and should pursue, by all appropriate means and without delay, a policy of eliminating all forms of violence against women, as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women; 4. Calls upon States to address discrimination based on multiple and intersecting factors, which places women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, violence and abuse, and to take appropriate action to empower and protect them as well as achieve their full enjoyment of human rights without discrimination; 5. Also calls upon States to ensure that all human rights are respected, protected and fulfilled while combating the pandemic and that their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are in full compliance with their human rights obligations and commitments; 6. Urges States to take effective action to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls and to address structural and underlying causes and risk factors, including by: (a) Designing and implementing appropriate domestic policies that are aimed at transforming discriminatory social attitudes and social and cultural patterns of conduct that condone violence against women and girls with a view to preventing and eliminating, in all public and private spheres, discrimination, gender stereotypes, negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours, and unequal power relations by which women and girls are regarded as subordinate to men and boys and that underlie and perpetuate male domination; (b) Designing or strengthening and implementing measures that remove remaining barriers to access to justice and enable all women and girls to have equal 5/10 access to justice systems, adapted and appropriate to their needs and access to effective, timely, appropriate and victim-centred remedies;

(d) Designing and implementing legislation and policies to prevent and respond to gender-related killing of women and girls, including femicide, and to end impunity for such cases; (ec) Preventing, combating and eliminating trafficking in women and girls by criminalizing all forms of trafficking in persons, as well as by raising public awareness of the issue of trafficking in persons, particularly women and girls, including the factors that make women and girls vulnerable to trafficking, and eliminating the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation and forced labour, and encouraging, where appropriate, the media to play a role with a view to eliminating the exploitation of women and children; (f) Taking measures to empower women by, inter alia, strengthening their economic autonomy and ensuring their full and equal participation in society and in decision-making processes by adopting and implementing social and economic policies that guarantee women full and equal access to quality education and training and affordable and adequate public and social services, as well as full and equal access to financial resources and decent work, and full and equal rights to own and have access to and control over land and other property, and guaranteeing women’s and girls’ inheritance rights, and taking further appropriate measures to address the increasing rate of homelessness of and inadequate housing for women in order to reduce their vulnerability to violence; (g) Implementing, in partnership with all relevant stakeholders, effective violence prevention and response activities in schools and communities, educating children from a young age regarding the importance of treating all people with dignity and respect, and designing educational programmes and teaching materials that support gender equality, respectful relationships and non-violent behaviour;
