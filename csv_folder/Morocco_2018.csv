Secretary-General,' Bearing in mind that weaknesses in crime prevention lead to subsequent difficulties at the level of crime control mechanisms, and bearing in mind also the urgent need to establish effective crime prevention strategies for Africa, as well as the importance of law enforcement agencies and the judiciary at the regional and subregional levels, Aware of the devastating impact of new and more dynamic crime trends on the national economies of African States, such as the high levels of transnational organized crime, including the utilization of digital technology to commit all types of cybercrime, and aware also of illicit trafficking in cultural property, drugs, precious metals, rhinoceros horns and ivory, of piracy and money-laundering and of the fact that crime is a major obstacle to harmonious and sustainable development in Africa, Deeply concerned about the growing links, in some cases, between some forms of transnational organized crime and terrorism, and

necessary funds, the Institute will fail to accomplish its vital goals of combating drug trafficking, cybercrime and environmental crimes, among other challenges, as well as its goals of reforming the
