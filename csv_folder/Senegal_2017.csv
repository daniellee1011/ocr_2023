'S Resolution 65/277, annex. '6 Resolution 70/266, annex. 2/12 Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, '” Deeply concerned that the extreme situation of girls in child-headed households persists and that poverty, armed conflict, climate-related and other hazards, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, including the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, and other humanitarian emergencies increase the incidence of child-headed households, forcing children, particularly girls, to undertake adult responsibilities, including being the main household earner and caring for younger siblings, and making them particularly vulnerable to poverty, violence, including physical and sexual violence, and discrimination, which seriously inhibits their development and violates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also about the continuing lack of recent information and statistics, disaggregated by sex, on the status of children in child-headed households, which are necessary to inform appropriate policy responses by Member States and the United Nations system, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the unpaid care and domestic work related to the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its worst forms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and affected by armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without nationality or birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child labour and that many children face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with unpaid care and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood and hamper the full enjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent employment in the future, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, Recognizing that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence and forced labour, which, among other things, would hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and the empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing further that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through girls’ organizations with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, ""7 See FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, decision 1/CP.21, annex. 3/12 Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, including those that disproportionately affect girls, such as child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence, trafficking in persons and the use of information and communications technology and social media to perpetrate violence against women and girls, and, in addition, about the corresponding impunity and lack of accountability, and that violence against women and girls is underrecognized and underreported, particularly at the community level, which reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, including girls with disabilities, bearing in mind their specific needs, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriage, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned further that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and childbirth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long- term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned that young women and girls are particularly affected by water scarcity, unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene, and concerned furthermore that girls, especially those in rural areas, are often excluded from full and continued participation in school owing to their burden of water procurement at home, a lack of water and sanitation facilities in schools and inadequate access to effective feminine hygiene products, Emphasizing that increased and equal access to quality education for young people, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Recognizing that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from education, and recognizing also that among gendered barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of their right to education are child marriage, early pregnancy, gender-based violence, the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and gender stereotypes and negative social norms that lead families and communities to place less value on girls’ education when compared with that of boys, 4/12 Deeply concerned that school-related violence against girls, including sexual violence and harassment on the way to and from and at school, such as violence perpetrated by teachers, continues to deter girls’ education and, in many cases, the transition to and completion of secondary education, and that these risks may influence parents’ decision to allow girls to attend school, Noting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in schools, and recognizing that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and reduce absenteeism, especially for girls, Stressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, the specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources and technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs and priorities of the girl child, 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;!® 2. Stresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of the child, including the girl child, as provided under international human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,! the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,” the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? and the Optional Protocols thereto‘ as a matter of priority; 3. Urges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138),!? and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182),”° of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 4. Urges States to develop or review relevant programmes that promote gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and equal access to basic social services, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, birth registration, health care, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the major causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream a gender perspective into all development policies and programmes, including those specific to the girl child; 5. Also urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, including extreme poverty, deprived of adequate food and nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health- care services, shelter, education, participation and protection; 6. Recognizes that ensuring equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality education requires transformations in education systems, mainstreaming a gender perspective into educational programmes, infrastructure development and teacher training, and in this regard calls upon States to invest in quality education, including through adequate financing, to ensure that all girls, including those who are marginalized or in vulnerable situations, enjoy their right to education; 7. Notes the role of the United Nations in supporting national Governments in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development?! and in realizing girls’ right to education; 8.
