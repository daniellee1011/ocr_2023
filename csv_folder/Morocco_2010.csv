Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 22. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in order to enhance the contribution development cooperation and food aid to the realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all stakeholders; 23.

Option 2: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the need to deepen the understanding of potential consequences of response measures taken by Annex I Parties on developing country Parties and that this can be achieved through various means including assessments of potential and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations. Option 3: The SBI [and the SBSTA Jnoted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the potential impacts of response measures. The SBI [and the SBSTA Jalso noted the need to deepen the understanding on the potential impacts of response measures to respond to climate change. This could be achieved through: 53 FCCC/SBI/2010/10 (a) | Assessments of potential impacts and observed impacts carried out by, inter alia, relevant national institutions and international organizations; (b) Information from work being carried out by other UNFCCC bodies that may be relevant in considering potential impacts; (c) The regular and systematic provision by all Parties of information that is as complete as possible on potential and observed impacts of policies and measures, in particular through national communications, and the regular review of this information. 10.
