Sweden, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Zimbabwe",N/A,The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts,"The General Assembly, Recognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds is a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in, and proliferation of, armaments, especially small arms and light weapons, Also recognizing the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts, Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security, Recognizing therefore that urgent action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, Also recognizing the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for urgent international action to prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a critical contribution to the economies of many of the producing, exporting and importing States, especially developing States, Noting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from legitimate sources, Recalling all the resolutions related to conflict diamonds of the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter, and determined to contribute to and support the implementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions, Also recalling its resolution 55/56 of 1 December 2000, in which it called upon the international community to develop detailed proposals for a simple and workable international certification scheme for rough diamonds based primarily on national certification schemes and on internationally agreed minimum standards, Believing that the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict can be substantially reduced by introducing an international certification scheme for rough diamonds and that such a scheme would help protect legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on trade in conflict diamonds, Emphasizing that the envisaged international certification scheme for rough diamonds should be simple, effective and pragmatic, should not impede the present legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and should not hinder the development of the diamond industry, Acknowledging the important initiatives already taken to address the problem of conflict diamonds, in particular by the Governments of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea and Sierra Leone and by other key producing, exporting and importing countries, and encouraging those Governments to continue the initiatives, Also acknowledging the continued efforts of regional organizations and other groups of countries to curb conflict diamonds, Welcoming the important contribution made by the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council, as well as civil society, to assist international efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds, Also welcoming voluntary self-regulation initiatives for the diamond industry announced by the World Diamond Council, and recognizing that a system of such voluntary self-regulation will contribute to ensuring the effectiveness of national systems of internal controls for rough diamonds, Recognizing that an international certification scheme for rough diamonds will only be credible if all participants have established internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices as well as differences in institutional controls thereof may require different approaches to meet minimum standards, Welcoming the important contribution made by the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African producing countries towards developing proposals for the envisaged international certification scheme, A/56/L.72 Noting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis, involving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing States, the diamond industry and civil society, Recognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and the principles of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to, 1. Notes with appreciation the report on the Kimberley Processtubmitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 55/56, and congratulates the participants in the Kimberley Process on their achievements thus far; 2. Recognizes that the proposed international certification scheme for rough diamonds would also help to ensure the effective implementation of relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on the trade in conflict diamonds, and calls for the full implementation of existing Security Council measures targeting the illicit trade in rough diamonds that play a role in fuelling conflict; 3. Welcomes the detailed proposals for an international certification scheme for rough diamonds developed in the Kimberley Process and presented in the form of Kimberley Process working document 9/2001 (as amended), entitled “Essential elements of an international scheme of certification for rough diamonds, with a view to breaking the link hetween armed conflict and the trade in rough diamonds”, dated 29 November 2001,% which provide a good basis for the proposed certification scheme; 4. Encourages the Kimberley Process to resolve outstanding issues; 5. Emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the measures taken to implement the international certification scheme for rough diamonds are consistent with international law governing international trade; 6. Urges the finalization of the international certification scheme, and its subsequent implementation, as soon as possible, recognizing the urgency of the situation from a humanitarian and security standpoint; 7. Underlines the need, as an essential tool for the successful implementation of the proposed international certification scheme, for the collation and dissemination of relevant statistical data on the production of, and international trade in, rough diamonds; 8. Supports the extension of the work of the Kimberley Process until such time as an international certification scheme is adopted and its simultancous implementation by participants begins; 9. Urges Member States to participate actively in the proposed international certification scheme, and stresses that the widest possible participation in the proposed international certification scheme is essential and should be encouraged and facilitated; 10. Welcomes the offer by the Government of Canada to host the next meeting of the Kimberley Process in Ottawa, in order to achieve further progress; 1 See A/56/502, A/56/675 and A/56/775. 2 See A/56/775, annex VIII.

Annex Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime I. Introduction 1. There is clear evidence that well-planned crime prevention strategies not only prevent crime and victimization, but also promote community safety and contribute to the sustainable development of countries. Effective, responsible crime prevention enhances the quality of life of all citizens. It has long-term benefits in terms of reducing the costs associated with the formal criminal justice system, as well as other social costs that result from crime. Crime prevention offers opportunities for a more cost-effective and humane approach to the problems of crime. The present Guidelines outline the necessary elements for effective crime prevention. II. Conceptual frame of reference 2. It is the responsibility of all levels of government to create, maintain and promote a context within which relevant governmental institutions and all segments of civil society, including the corporate sector, can better play their part in preventing crime. 3. For the purposes of the present Guidelines, “crime prevention” comprises strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occurring, and their potential harmful effects on individuals and society, including fear of crime, by intervening to influence their multiple causes. The enforcement of laws, sentences and corrections, while also performing preventive functions, falls outside the scope of the Guidelines, given the comprehensive coverage of the subject in other United Nations instruments.3 4. The present Guidelines address crime and its effects on victims and society and take into account the growing internationalization of criminal activities. 5. Community involvement and cooperation/partnerships represent important elements of the concept of crime prevention set out herein. 6. Crime prevention encompasses a wide range of approaches, including those which: 3 See Compendium of United Nations Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.92.1V.1 and corrigendum). E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 (a) Promote the well-being of people and encourage pro-social behaviour through social, economic, health and educational measures, with a particular emphasis on children and youth, and focus on the risk and protective factors associated with crime and victimization (prevention through social development or social crime prevention); (b) Change the conditions in neighbourhoods that influence offending, victimization and the insecurity that results from crime by building on the initiatives, expertise and commitment of community members (locally based crime prevention); (c) Prevent the occurrence of crimes by reducing opportunities, increasing risks of being apprehended and minimizing benefits, including through environmental design, and by providing assistance and information to potential and actual victims (situational crime prevention); (d) Prevent recidivism by assisting in the social reintegration of offenders (reintegration programmes). III. Basic principles Government leadership 7. All levels of government should play a leadership role in developing effective and humane crime prevention strategies and in creating and maintaining institutional frameworks for their implementation and review. Socio-economic development and inclusion 8. Crime prevention considerations should be integrated into all relevant social and economic policies and programmes, including those addressing employment, education, health, housing and urban planning, poverty, social marginalization and exclusion. Particular emphasis should be placed on communities, families, children and youth at risk. Cooperation/partnerships 9. Cooperation/partnerships are an integral part of effective crime prevention, given the wide-ranging nature of the causes of crime and the skills and responsibilities required to address them. This includes partnerships working across ministries and between authorities, community organizations, non-governmental organizations, the business sector and private citizens. Sustainability/accountability 10. Crime prevention requires adequate resources, including funding for structures and activities, in order to be sustained. There should be clear accountability for funding, implementation and evaluation and for the achievement of planned results. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 Knowledge base 11. Crime prevention strategies, policies, programmes and actions should be based on a broad, multidisciplinary foundation of knowledge about crime problems, their multiple causes and promising and proven practices. Human rights/rule of law/culture of lawfulness 12. The rule of law and those human rights which are recognized in international instruments to which Member States are parties must be respected in all aspects of crime prevention. A culture of lawfulness should be actively promoted in crime prevention. Interdependency 13. National crime prevention diagnoses and strategies should, where appropriate, take account of links between local criminal problems and international organized crime. Differentiation 14. Crime prevention strategies should pay due regard to the different needs of men and women and consider the special needs of vulnerable members of society. IV. Organization, methods and approaches 15. Recognizing that all States have unique governmental structures, this section sets out tools and methodologies that Governments and all segments of civil society should consider in developing strategies to prevent crime and reduce victimization. It draws on international good practice. Community involvement 16. In some of the areas listed below, Governments bear the primary responsibility. However, the active participation of communities and other segments of civil society is an essential part of effective crime prevention. Communities, in particular, can play an important part in identifying crime prevention priorities, in implementation and evaluation, and in helping identify a sustainable resource base. A. Organization Government structures 17. Governments should include prevention as a permanent part of their structures and programmes for controlling crime, ensuring that clear responsibilities and goals exist within government for the organization of crime prevention, by, inter alia: (a) Establishing centres or focal points with expertise and resources; (b) Establishing a crime prevention plan with clear priorities and targets; (c) Establishing linkages and coordination between relevant government agencies or departments; E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 (d) Fostering partnerships with non-governmental organizations, the business, private and professional sectors and the community; (e) Seeking the active participation of the public in crime prevention by informing it of the need for and means of action and its role. Training and capacity-building 18. Governments should support the development of crime prevention skills by: (a) Providing professional development for senior officials in relevant agencies; (b) Encouraging universities, colleges and other relevant educational agencies to offer basic and advanced courses, including in collaboration with practitioners; (¢) Working with the educational and professional sectors to develop certification and professional qualifications; (d) Promoting the capacity of communities to develop and respond to their needs. Supporting partnerships 19. Governments and all segments of civil society should support the principle of partnership, where appropriate, including: (a) Advancing knowledge of the importance of this principle and the components of successful partnerships, including the need for all of the partners to have clear and transparent roles; (b) Fostering their formation at different levels and across sectors; (c¢) Facilitating their efficient operation. Sustainability 20. Governments and other funding bodies should strive to achieve sustainability of demonstrably effective crime prevention programmes and initiatives through, inter alia: (a) Reviewing resource allocation to establish and maintain an appropriate balance between crime prevention and the criminal justice and other systems, to be more effective in preventing crime and victimization; (b) Establishing clear accountability for funding, programming and coordinating crime prevention initiatives; (¢) Encouraging community involvement in sustainability. B. Methods Knowledge base 21. As appropriate, Governments and/or civil society should facilitate knowledge- based crime prevention by, inter alia: E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 (a) Providing the information necessary for communities to address crime problems; (b) Supporting the generation of useful and practically applicable knowledge that is scientifically reliable and valid; (c) Supporting the organization and synthesis of knowledge and identifying and addressing gaps in the knowledge base; (d) Sharing that knowledge, as appropriate, among, inter alia, researchers, policy makers, educators, practitioners from other relevant sectors and the wider community; (e) Applying this knowledge in replicating successful interventions, developing new initiatives and anticipating new crime problems and prevention opportunities; (f) Establishing data systems to help manage crime prevention more cost- effectively, including by conducting regular surveys of victimization and offending; (g) Promoting the application of those data in order to reduce repeat victimization, persistent offending and areas with a high level of crime. Planning interventions 22. Those planning interventions should promote a process that includes: (a) A systematic analysis of crime problems, their causes, risk factors and consequences, in particular at the local level; (b) A plan that draws on the most appropriate approach and adapts interventions to the specific local problem and context; (c) An implementation plan to deliver appropriate interventions that are efficient, effective and sustainable; (d) Mobilizing entities that are able to tackle causes; (e) Monitoring and evaluation. Support evaluation 23. Governments, other funding bodies and those involved in programme development and delivery should: (a) Undertake short- and longer-term evaluation to test rigorously what works, where and why; (b) Undertake cost-benefit analyses; (c) Assess the extent to which action results in a reduction in levels of crime and victimization, in the seriousness of crime and in fear of crime; (d) Systematically assess the outcomes and unintended consequences, both positive and negative, of action, such as a decrease in crime rates or the stigmatization of individuals and/or communities. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 Approaches 24. This section expands upon the social developmental and situational crime prevention approaches. It also outlines approaches that Governments and civil society should endeavour to follow in order to prevent organized crime. Social development 25. Governments should address the risk factors of crime and victimization by: (a) Promoting protective factors through comprehensive and non- stigmatizing social and economic development programmes, including health, education, housing and employment; (b) Promoting activities that redress marginalization and exclusion; (c) Promoting positive conflict resolution; (d) Using education and public awareness strategies to foster a culture of lawfulness and tolerance while respecting cultural identities. Situational 26. Governments and civil society, including where appropriate the corporate sector, should support the development of situational crime prevention programmes by, inter alia: (a) Improved environmental design; (b) Appropriate methods of surveillance that are sensitive to the right to privacy; (c) Encouraging the design of consumer goods to make them more resistant to crime; (d) Target “hardening” without impinging upon the quality of the built environment or limiting free access to public space; (e) Implementing strategies to prevent repeat victimization. Prevention of organized crime 27. Governments and civil society should endeavour to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems by, inter alia: (a) Reducing existing and future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in lawful markets with the proceeds of crime, through appropriate legislative, administrative or other measures; (b) Developing measures to prevent the misuse by organized criminal groups of tender procedures conducted by public authorities and of subsidies and licences granted by public authorities for commercial activity; (c) Designing crime prevention strategies, where appropriate, to protect socially marginalized groups, especially women and children, who are vulnerable to the action of organized criminal groups, including trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 V. International cooperation Standards and norms 28. In promoting international action in crime prevention, Member States should set out achievable and specific tasks that take into account the main international instruments related to human rights and crime prevention to which they are parties, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child (General Assembly resolu- tion 44/25, annex), the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (resolution 48/104), the United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines) (resolution 45/112, annex), the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (resolution 40/34, annex), the Guidelines for Cooperation and Technical Assistance in the Field of Urban Crime Prevention (Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/9, annex), as well as the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century (General Assembly resolu- tion 55/59, annex) and the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto (resolutions 55/25, annexes I-III, and 55/255, annex). Technical assistance 29. Member States and relevant international funding organizations should provide financial and technical assistance, including capacity-building and training, to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, communities and other relevant organizations for the implementation of effective crime prevention and community safety strategies at the regional, national and local levels. In that context, special attention should be given to research and action on crime prevention through social development. Networking 30. Member States should strengthen or establish international, regional and national crime prevention networks with a view to exchanging proven and promising practices, identifying elements of their transferability and making such knowledge available to communities throughout the world. Links between transnational and local crime 31. Member States should collaborate to analyse and address the links between transnational organized crime and national and local crime problems. Prioritizing crime prevention 32. The Centre for International Crime Prevention, the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network of affiliated and associated institutes and other relevant United Nations entities should include in their priorities crime prevention as set out in these Guidelines, set up a coordination mechanism and establish a roster of experts to undertake needs assessment and to provide technical advice. E/CN.15/2002/L.3/Rev.1 Dissemination 33. Relevant United Nations bodies and other organizations should cooperate to produce crime prevention information in as many languages as possible, using both print and electronic media. 10",04/22/2002,2002_469943,Botswana,N/A,yes
