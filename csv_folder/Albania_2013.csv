enabling their work in recent resolutions and the panel discussion on women human rights defenders convened on 26 June 2012, Acknowledging that women of all ages who engage in the defence of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and those related to gender, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, including in addressing all forms of human rights violations, combating impunity, fighting poverty and discrimination, and promoting access to justice, democracy, the full participation of women in society, tolerance, human dignity and the right to development, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through restrictions on freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings, Gravely concerned that women human rights defenders are at risk of and suffer violations and abuses, including systematic violations of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, at the hands of State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and social norms that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, Gravely concerned that impunity for violations against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, taboos with regard to gender-specific violations and abuses such as sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, intersecting or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, 2/6 Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Recalling the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, by State and non-State actors against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the role, behaviours and activities of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political, social and economic status are essential to respect for all human rights and the achievement of representative, transparent and accountable government, democratic institutions and sustainable

Stresses that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, which includes the freedom to have, or not to have, or to 2/7 adopt a religion or belief of one’s own choice, and the freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one’s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance, including the right to change one’s religion or belief; 2. Also stresses that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief applies equally to all persons, regardless of their religion or belief and without any discrimination as to their equal protection by the law; 3. Strongly condemns violations of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief as well as all forms of intolerance, discrimination and violence based on religion or belief; 4.

Condemns violence and acts of terrorism, which are increasing in number, targeting individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities across the world; 6. Emphasizes that no religion should be equated with terrorism, as this may have adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of all members of the religious communities concerned; 7.

Expresses concern at the persistence of institutionalized social intolerance and discrimination practised against many on the grounds of religion or belief, and emphasizes that legal procedures pertaining to religious or belief-based groups and places of worship are not a prerequisite for the exercise of the right to manifest one’s religion or belief and that such procedures, when legally required at the national or local level, should be non-discriminatory in order to contribute to the effective protection of the right of all persons to practise their religion or belief, either individually or in community with others and in public or private; 11. Recognizes with concern the challenges faced by persons in vulnerable or marginalized groups or situations in exercising their right to freedom of religion or belief; 12.

Also emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, where the need to protect public morals is invoked to justify restrictions, such restrictions must respect the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination and must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition, as the concept of morals derives from many social, philosophical and religious traditions; 14. Expresses deep concern at emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief as well as the continued existence of instances of intolerance, discrimination and violence on the basis of religion or belief, including: (a) The increasing number of acts of violence and intolerance directed against individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities and other communities in various parts of the world, in particular those occurring in countries experiencing conflict or political instability; (b) The rise of religious extremism in various parts of the world that affects the rights of individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities; (c) Incidents of hatred, discrimination, intolerance and violence on the basis of religion or belief, which may be associated with or manifested by the derogatory stereotyping, negative profiling and stigmatization of persons based on their religion or belief; (d) Attacks on or destruction of religious places, sites and shrines in violation of international law, in particular human rights and humanitarian law, as they have more than material significance for the dignity and lives of members of communities holding spiritual or religious beliefs; (e) Instances, both in law and practice, that constitute violations of the human right to freedom of religion or belief, including of the individual right to publicly express one’s spiritual and religious beliefs, taking into account the relevant articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,’ as well as other international instruments; (f) Constitutional and legislative systems that fail to provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief to all without distinction; 15.

of water and sanitation within the three dimensions of sustainable development, Welcoming the holding of the General Assembly plenary meeting of 27 July 2011 entitled “The human right to water and sanitation”, Welcoming also the proclamation of 19 November as World Toilet Day in the context of “Sanitation for All”, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/291 of 24 July 2013, Recalling general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), and the statement on the right to sanitation of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 19 November 2010, as well as the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that approximately 768 million people still lack access to improved drinking water sources and that more than 2.5 billion do not have access to improved sanitation facilities, including more than 1.04 billion people who still practice open defecation, as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2013 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, and that these figures do not fully capture the dimensions of water safety, the affordability of services and the safe management of excreta and wastewater, as well as equality, non-discrimination and differences between urban and rural areas, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Noting that the target of the Millennium Development Goals of halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was formally met five years ahead of schedule, and deeply concerned that the world remains off track to meet the sanitation component of the same target, which called for halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to an improved sanitation facility, that by 2015, if current trends continue, the world is set to miss the target by more than half a billion people, and that inexistent or inadequate sanitation facilities and serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can have a negative impact on water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, Deeply alarmed that, every year, almost 700,000 children under 5 years of age die, and millions of schooldays are lost, as a result of water- and sanitation-related 2/4 diseases, and that girls in large parts of the world do not go to school for lack of separate toilets for girls, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the promotion and protection of all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Acknowledging the importance of equal access to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as an integral component of the realization of all human rights, Recalling that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure and acceptable, and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, 1.

Calls upon States: 1 A/67/270 and A/68/264. 2 A/68/202. 3/4 (a) To ensure the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation; (b) To continuously monitor and regularly analyse the status of the realization of the human right to safe drinking water; (c) To give due consideration to the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation, and the principles of equality and non-discrimination, in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda; (d) To ensure the progressive realization of the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds and with a view to progressively eliminating inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, residence in a slum, income levels and other relevant considerations; (e) To consult with communities on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation; (f) To provide for effective accountability mechanisms for all water and sanitation service providers to ensure that they respect human rights and do not cause human rights violations or abuses; 8.

Stresses the important role of the international cooperation and technical assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 12.

Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and their review outcomes, as well as the agreed conclusions and resolutions of the Commission on the Status of Women, Acknowledging the attention given by the Human Rights Council to the importance of women human rights defenders and of ensuring their protection and enabling their work in recent resolutions, and noting the panel discussion on women human rights defenders convened on 26 June 2012, Acknowledging that women of all ages who engage in the defence of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and in issues related to gender equality, herein referred to as women human rights defenders, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, in the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through the curtailment of freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings, Gravely concerned that women human rights defenders are at risk of and suffer violations and abuses, including systematic violations and abuses of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, by State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated or abused and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and those social norms or patterns that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, 1 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/66/53), chap. II, sect. A. 2 Ibid., Sixty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/68/53), chap. IV, sect. A. 2/7 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing gender-based violence, including sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses, discrimination and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and can be a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Stressing the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the important activities and legitimate role of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Recalling that the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms rests with the State, and reaffirming that national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other international obligations of the State in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms is the juridical framework within which human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, conduct their activities, Gravely concerned that, in some instances, national security and counter- terrorism legislation and other measures, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, have been misused to target human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, or have hindered their work and endangered their safety in a manner contrary to international law, Recognizing the urgent need to address, and to take concrete steps to prevent and stop, the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, to exercise their work, including by reviewing and, where necessary, amending relevant legislation and its implementation in order to ensure compliance with international human rights law, 3/7 Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political, social, legal and economic status are essential to respect for all human rights, the growth and prosperity of society and the achievement of representative, transparent and accountable government, democratic institutions and sustainable development in all areas of
