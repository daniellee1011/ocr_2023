The present Action Plan is offered as guidance to Member States in implementing the above-mentioned commitments. Organizations of the United Nations system,? other international organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations are invited to provide support to Member States in implementing the Action Plan, according to their available resources, specific mandates and the different roles that they are to play in achieving the goals set out in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction. 3. The Action Plan reflects the emphasis in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction on the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach involving demand reduction and supply reduction, each reinforcing the other, together with the appropriate application of the principle of shared responsibility. It stresses the need for services responsible for prevention, including law enforcement agencies, to transmit the same message and use similar language. 4. The Action Plan is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.?! It allows for flexible approaches to reflect social, cultural, religious and political differences, and it acknowledges that efforts to reduce illicit drug demand are at different levels of implementation in different countries. 5. The Action Plan recognizes that progress to reduce the demand for illicit drugs should be seen in the context of the need for programmes to reduce the demand for substances of abuse. Such programmes should be integrated to promote cooperation between all concerned, should include a wide variety of appropriate interventions, should promote health and social well-being among individuals, families and communities, and should reduce the adverse consequences of drug abuse for the individual and for society as a whole. 6. The Action Plan focuses on the need to design demand reduction campaigns and programmes to meet the needs of the population in general, as well as those of specific population groups, taking into account differences in gender, culture and education and 20 This may include, but is not restricted to, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, the Joint United Nations Programme on Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the International Labour Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Health Organization, as well as international financial institutions such as the World Bank. 2!
