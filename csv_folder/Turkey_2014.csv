V.14-03266 Annex International Guidelines for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Responses with respect to Trafficking in Cultural Property and Other Related Offences Introduction 1. The guidelines for crime prevention and criminal justice responses with respect to trafficking in cultural property and other related offences have been developed in recognition of the criminal character of such offences and their devastating consequences for the cultural heritage of humankind. Pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 66/180 and 68/186 and Economic and Social Council resolution 2010/19, guidelines were developed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in consultation with Member States and in close cooperation, as appropriate, with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and other competent international organizations. 2. The first of the guidelines was reviewed at an informal expert group meeting, held from 21 to 23 November 2011, composed of 20 experts from around the world, with expertise in various fields related to the subject matter of the guidelines, including representatives of INTERPOL, UNESCO and the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit). Based on the valuable comments and advice on improving the , a second was presented to and discussed by the intergovernmental expert group on protection against trafficking in cultural property in its second meeting, held from 27 to 29 June 2012. Taking into account a compendium, prepared by the Secretariat, of comments made by Member States on the guidelines, the intergovernmental expert group reviewed and revised the guidelines at its third meeting, held from 15 to 17 January 2014, with a view to their finalization. 3. The guidelines are based on crime prevention and criminal justice aspects of protection against trafficking in cultural property, taking into consideration a review of current practices and initiatives in several countries in addressing the problem of trafficking in cultural property, as well as principles and norms arising from the analysis of the following international legal instruments: the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime of 2000; the United Nations Convention against Corruption of 2003; the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954; the First Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1954; the Second Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 1999; the Protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts of 1977 (Additional Protocol I); the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970; the Unidroit Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects of 1995 and the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage of 2001. 4. This set of non-binding guidelines is available to Member States for their consideration in the development and strengthening of crime prevention and criminal justice policies, strategies, legislation and cooperation mechanisms to prevent and combat trafficking in cultural property and related offences in all V.14-03266 situations. Their development follows the expression, by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in their resolutions, of alarm at the growing involvement of organized criminal groups in all forms and aspects of trafficking in cultural property and related offences, and of the need to promote international cooperation to combat crime in a concerted manner. 5. The guidelines have the purpose of serving as a reference for national policymakers and as a tool for capacity-building in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice responses to trafficking in cultural property and related offences, in coordination with UNESCO and other competent international organizations, as appropriate. On the basis of the guidelines finalized by the intergovernmental expert group and submitted to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and taking into consideration the technical background document containing the version of the guidelines dated April 2012, and the comments made by Member States, the Commission may ask the Secretariat to develop a practical assistance tool, as appropriate, to aid in the implementation of the guidelines. 6. The guidelines contain four chapters: (a) Chapter I contains guidelines on crime prevention strategies (including information and data collection, the role of cultural institutions and the private sector, the monitoring of the cultural property market, imports and exports, and archaeological sites, as well as education and public awareness); (b) Chapter II contains guidelines on criminal justice policies (including adherence to and implementation of relevant international treaties, the criminalization of specific harmful conduct or the establishment of administrative offences, corporate liability, seizure and confiscation and investigative measures); (c) Chapter HI contains guidelines on international cooperation (including matters related to jurisdictional basis, extradition, seizure and _ confiscation, cooperation among law enforcement and investigating authorities, as well as the return, restitution or repatriation of cultural property); (d) Chapter IV contains a guideline on the scope of application of the guidelines. Prevention strategies Information and data collection Guideline 1. States should consider establishing and developing inventories or databases, as appropriate, of cultural property for the purpose of protection against its trafficking. The absence of registration of cultural property in such inventories shall by no means exclude it from protection against trafficking and related offences. Guideline 2. States should consider, where possible under their domestic legislation, the relevant cultural property as registered in the official inventory of a State that has enacted laws on national or State ownership, provided that the owner State has issued a public formal statement to that effect. V.14-03266 Guideline 3. States should consider: (a) Introducing or improving statistics on import and export of cultural property; (b) Introducing or improving statistics, where practical, on administrative and criminal offences against cultural property; (c) Establishing or improving national databases, as appropriate, on trafficking in cultural property and related offences and on trafficked, illicitly exported or imported, stolen, looted, illicitly excavated or illicitly traded or missing cultural property; (d) Introducing mechanisms to enable the reporting of suspicious dealings or sales on the Internet; (e) Contributing to international data collection on trafficking in cultural property and related offences through the United Nations Survey on Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, conducted by UNODC and the INTERPOL database on stolen works of art and through other relevant organizations; (f) Contributing to the UNESCO database of national laws and regulations pertaining to cultural property. Guideline 4.
