synergies among countries of origin, transit and destination and, where appropriate, other relevant stakeholders, in support of comprehensive and balanced policies, and taking note with appreciation of the generous offer of the Government of Switzerland to assume the Presidency of the Global Forum for 2011, Recognizing the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving societies and their communities of origin, as well as the need to identify appropriate means of maximizing development benefits and responding to the challenges which migration poses to countries of origin, transit and destination, especially in the light of the impact of the economic and financial crisis, and committing to ensuring dignified, humane treatment with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation, Emphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue

migration, treat A/C.3/65/L.34/Rev.1 irregular migration as a criminal rather than an administrative offence where the effect of doing so is to deny migrants full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, Aware that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to circumvent restrictive immigration policies, migrants become more vulnerable to, inter alia, kidnapping, extortion, forced labour, sexual exploitation, physical assault, debt servitude and abandonment, Recognizing the contributions of young migrants to countries of origin and destination, and in that regard encouraging States to consider the specific circumstances and needs of young migrants, Concerned about the large and growing number of migrants, especially women and children, who place
