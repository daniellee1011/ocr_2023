fisheries management organizations and arrangements, the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States, Concerned that some operators increasingly take advantage of the globalization of fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and make economic profits from those operations, which constitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities, Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications, Recognizing also that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing may give rise to safety and security concerns for individuals on vessels engaged in such activities, Welcoming cooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization, in particular in assisting States and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, Recognizing the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the

build their capacity in this regard, taking note of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop a legally binding instrument on minimum standards for port State measures, Noting that the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization have adopted port State measures, to be applied by their members, which include prohibition of entry and use of port services, including landing and trans-shipment, to vessels identified by those regional fisheries management organizations as engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities and that those measures prevent and deter such activities, Concerned that marine pollution from all sources, including vessels and, in particular, land-based sources, constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, due to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary, Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, and therefore welcoming the adoption in 2007 of the Strategy for

sustainable use of shark populations and fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999, in providing guidance on the development of such measures, Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant subregional and regional fisheries Management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, while noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking, that only a small number of countries have implemented the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries, Expressing concern that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, and emphasizing that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, Expressing concern also over reports of continued losses of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality in 6 E/CN.17/2002/PC.2/3, annex. 7 See UNEP/CBD/COP/7/21, annex.
