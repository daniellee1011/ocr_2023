Urges States to improve the situation of children living in poverty, in particular extreme poverty, deprived of adequate food and nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health- care services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, while a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is particularly threatening and harmful to children, leaving them unable to enjoy their rights, to reach their full potential and to participate as full members of society, and exposed to conditions that lead to increased violence; 11. Calls upon States to scale up scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, with information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality, girls’ and women’s empowerment, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in their relationships, to enable them to build self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk-reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with all relevant actors, including young people, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to, inter alia, enable them to make safe, conscious and responsible decisions and protect themselves from risks; 12.

Urges States to take immediate and effective measures to secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour and to end child labour in all its forms by 2025 at the latest; 14.

Calls upon all States to protect the human rights of all children and to ensure, for children belonging to minorities in vulnerable situations, including migrant children, indigenous children, children of African descent, internally displaced children and children with disabilities, the enjoyment of all human rights as well as access to health care, social services, social protection and accessible and inclusive education on an equal basis with others, and to ensure that all such children, in particular unaccompanied migrant children, internally displaced children and those who are victims of violence and exploitation, receive special protection and assistance and that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in their policies of integration, return and family reunification; 16. Condemns in the strongest terms all violations and abuses committed against children in armed conflict, and in this regard urges all States and other parties to armed conflict that are engaged, in contravention of applicable international law, in the recruitment and use of children, in patterns of killing and maiming of children and/or rape and other sexual violence against children, acknowledging that sexual violence in these situations disproportionately affects girls, but that boys are also targets, in recurrent attacks on schools and/or hospitals and related personnel and in patterns of abduction of children, as well as in all other violations and abuses against children, to take time-bound and effective measures to end and prevent them and to encourage age- and gender-specific support services, including psychological, social and sexual and reproductive health-care services, and education, social protection and reintegration programmes; I Children without parental care 17. Recalls that, in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it is recognized that a child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality and potential, should grow up in a family environment and that a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State, and that States parties shall, in accordance with their national laws and their obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, ensure quality alternative care for such a child; 18. Recognizes that in different cultural, political and social systems, various forms of the family exist, and that all families should be supported in undertaking their role in the promotion of the human rights of children within their care; 19. Recalls that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities* requires all States parties to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of 7/14 all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, including with respect to family life; 20. Reaffirms that children shall not be separated from their parents against their will, except when competent authorities, subject to judicial review, determine in accordance with applicable law and procedures that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. Such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents or legal guardians, or one where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to the child’s place of residence; 21. Also reaffirms that children shall not be deprived of their liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily and that the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, and with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration; 22. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the status of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,?° in which it is recognized that children without parental care are more likely than their peers to experience human rights violations, such as exclusion, violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation, and in this regard expresses deep concern about the potential harm of institutionalization and institutional care to children’s growth and development when such placement is not compliant with the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 23. Recognizes that many children living without parental care have families, including at least one parent alive and/or other relatives, and that many countries are working to implement international standards, prevent the unnecessary use of institutionalization of children and reunify children who have been separated from their families; 24. Stresses that, where it is in their best interests, children should not have to give up family connections in order to escape poverty or receive care, supportive services, comprehensive, timely and quality health services, or education, or because they are in contact with the law; 25. Recognizes that violence, including domestic violence, poverty, structural violence and survival activities may lead children into the juvenile justice system, and that detention in the criminal justice system is sometimes used as a substitute for prevention and referral to child protection authorities; 26. Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to the child’s family, benefiting the child directly; 27. Urges States to strengthen child welfare and child protection systems and improve care reform efforts, which should include increased multisectoral collaboration between child welfare and health, education, justice and other sectors, active coordination among all relevant authorities, improved cross-border systems and improved capacity-building and training programmes for relevant stakeholders; 28. Expresses deep concern regarding the large and growing number of migrant children, particularly those who are unaccompanied or separated from their parents or primary caregivers, who may be particularly vulnerable along their journey, and expresses the commitment to protect the human rights of migrant children, given their vulnerability, in particular unaccompanied migrant children and migrant 8/14 children with disabilities, to ensure that they receive appropriate protection and assistance and to provide for their health, education and psychosocial development, ensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in policies on integration, return and family reunification; 29. Urges States to take effective action to provide support to families and to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their parents, including by: (a) Working towards ending the unnecessary use of institutionalization of children and prioritizing investments in child protection services and social services to support quality alternative care, including families and communities, in order to prevent the separation of children from their families, with the best interests of the child as the primary consideration; (b) Adopting and enforcing laws and improving the implementation of policies and programmes, budget allocation and human resources to support children, in particular children with disabilities and children living in disadvantaged, stigmatized and marginalized families, to address the root causes of unnecessary family separation and ensure that they are cared for effectively by their own families and communities; (c) Taking all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child, including children witnessing domestic violence and orphans by domestic crimes, from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parents, legal guardians or any other person who has the care of the child; (d) Ensuring that a child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will, except when such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child, and recognizing the right of a child who has been placed by competent authorities for the purpose of care, protection or treatment of his or her physical or mental health to a periodic review of the treatment provided to the child and all other circumstances relevant to his or her placement;

Calls upon all Member States to ensure that children associated or allegedly associated with armed groups should be treated primarily as victims and in line with the best interests of the child, and to consider non-judicial measures as alternatives to prosecution and detention and take measures that focus on rehabilitation and reintegration in an environment that fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child, in accordance with relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, as well as human rights law, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 20. Calls upon States to protect children affected by armed conflict, in particular from violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, and to ensure that they receive timely, effective humanitarian assistance, noting the efforts taken to end impunity by ensuring accountability and punishing perpetrators, and calls upon the international community to hold those responsible for violations accountable, inter alia, through the International Criminal Court; I Children without parental care 21. Recalls that the Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes that a child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality and potential, should grow up in a family environment and that a child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State, and that States parties shall, in accordance with their national laws and their obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, ensure safe and appropriate quality alternative care for such a child; 22. Urges all States parties to intensify their efforts to comply with their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child to preserve the identity of children, including their nationality, name and family relations, as recognized by law, to protect children in matters relating to birth registration, family relations and adoption or other forms of alternative care, recognizing that every effort should be directed to enabling children to remain in or swiftly return to the care of their parents or, when appropriate, other close family members and that, where alternative care is necessary, family and community-based care should be promoted over placement in institutions; 23. Recalls that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities® requires all States parties to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, including with respect to family life; 24. Reaffirms that children shall not be separated from their parents against their will except when competent authorities, subject to judicial review, determine in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child, and that such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents, or one where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to the child’s place of residence; 25. Reaffirms that a child shall not be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily and that the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, and that every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age; 8/15 26. Notes that children without parental care are more likely than their peers to experience human rights violations, such as exclusion, violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation, and in this regard expresses deep concern on the potential harm of institutionalization and institutional care to children’s growth and development; 27. Recognizes that many children living without parental care have families, including at least one parent alive and/or relatives, and in this regard encourages actions to achieve family reunification unless it is not in the best interests of the child; 28. Stresses that no child should be forced to give up family connections in order to escape poverty, or to receive care, comprehensive, timely and quality health services or education, or because they are in contact with the law; 29. Recognizes that poverty, all forms of violence, including mental and physical violence, domestic violence, structural violence and survival activities may lead children into the criminal justice system, including the juvenile justice system, and that detention in the criminal justice system is sometimes used as a substitute for prevention and referral to child protection authorities and services; 30. Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers and legal guardians, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to their family, benefiting the child directly; 31. Urges States to strengthen child welfare and child protection systems and improve care reform efforts, which should include increased multisectoral collaboration, inter alia, between child welfare and health, education and justice sectors, active coordination among all relevant authorities, improved cross-border systems and improved capacity-building and training programmes for relevant stakeholders; 32. Expresses deep concern regarding the large and growing number of migrant children, particularly those who are unaccompanied or separated from their parents or primary caregivers, who may be particularly vulnerable along their journey, and expresses the commitment to protect the human rights of migrant children, given their vulnerability, in particular unaccompanied migrant children and migrant children with disabilities, to ensure that they receive appropriate protection and assistance and to provide for their health, education and psychosocial development, ensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in policies on integration, return and family reunification; 33. Calls upon States to take all measures necessary to prevent and combat illegal adoptions and all adoptions that are not in the best interests of the child; 34. Urges States to take effective action to provide support to families and to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their parents, including by: (a) Prioritizing investments in child protection services and social services to support quality alternative care, including families and communities in order to prevent the separation of children from their families, with the best interests of the child as the primary consideration; (b) Adopting and enforcing laws and improving the implementation of policies and programmes, budget allocation and human resources to support children, particularly children with disabilities, and children living in disadvantaged, stigmatized and marginalized families, to address the root causes of unnecessary family separation and ensure that they are cared for effectively by their own families and communities; 9/15 (c) Taking all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child;

(g) Providing gender-sensitive and child-sensitive social protection systems, which are key to ensuring poverty reduction, including, as appropriate, targeted cash transfers for families in vulnerable situations, as can be the case of families headed by a single parent, in particular those headed by women or by children, and which are most effective in reducing poverty when accompanied by other measures, such as providing access to basic services, high-quality education, affordable quality childcare services and health-care services; (h) Supporting and assisting families’ and caregivers’ capacities in regard to child development, including through comprehensive education and training, and the promotion of involved and positive parenting to enable them to provide children with care in a safe environment;

Also urges States to take action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights for all children without parental care, in accordance with the international human rights framework, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, not least the rights to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health, education, to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age and maturity of the child, and also to take action to provide a range of alternative care options and to protect all children without parental care, including by: (a) Promoting the implementation of international frameworks, notably the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, including through training on the Guidelines for care staff and others working with children, and strengthening national legislation, regulations and policies to protect the rights of children without parental care;
