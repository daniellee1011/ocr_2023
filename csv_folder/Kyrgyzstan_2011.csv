The Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States was created in 2009 as an international intergovernmental organization with the overarching aim of promoting comprehensive cooperation among its four founding member States (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey). 2. According to the first two statutory documents of the Cooperation Council, the Nakhchivan Agreement of 3 October 2009 and the Istanbul Declaration of 16 September 2010, States members of the Cooperation Council embrace the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, along with other universally recognized principles of international law. Established norms related to the maintenance of peace and security and the development of good-neighbourly relations lay the foundation for cooperation to be developed under the Cooperation Council. 3. The Cooperation Council builds upon the common political will that has evolved through the Summits of the Heads of the Turkic-speaking Countries that have been convened since 1992. Ten such Summits have been held to date, the most recent of which was the Istanbul Summit of 16 September 2010, at which the Cooperation Council was promulgated and its priorities were mapped out. With the establishment of the Cooperation Council as a permanent body, the Summits are renamed Summits of the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States. II. Principles and objectives 4. The Preamble of the Nakhchivan Agreement reaffirms the common will of the States members of the Cooperation Council to adhere to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and encapsulates the objectives of the Cooperation Council as further deepening the comprehensive cooperation among Turkic-speaking States and making joint contributions to peace and stability in the region and the world. Member States have stated their commitment to the basic principles of democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance. Cooperation within the framework of the Cooperation Council is based in particular on the solidarity stemming from the common history, culture, identity and language of Turkic-speaking peoples. 5. Article 1 of the Nakhchivan Agreement sets out the main purposes and tasks of the organization as follows: (a) Strengthening mutual confidence among the parties; (b) Maintaining peace in the region and beyond; (c) Promoting common positions on foreign policy issues; (d) Coordinating actions to combat international terrorism, separatism, extremism and transborder crimes; (e) Promoting effective regional and bilateral cooperation in all areas of common interest; A/66/141 (f) Creating favourable conditions for trade and investment; (g) Aiming for comprehensive and balanced economic growth, and social and cultural development; (h) Discussing questions related to ensuring the rule of law, good governance and the protection of human rights; (i) Expanding interaction in the fields of science, technology, education and culture; (Gj) Encouraging interaction among the mass media and_ wider communication; (k) Promoting the exchange of legal information and enhancing legal cooperation. 6. Within this broad mandate, the organization functions essentially as a permanent mechanism whereby member States come together to discuss issues of common concern and carry out projects in all spheres of mutual benefit. According to the Istanbul Declaration, the areas of cooperation under the Cooperation Council framework are identified as: foreign policy coordination; trade and economic development; industry; agriculture; energy; transport; communications; banking and insurance; education; culture; scientific research; climate change; environmental protection; tourism; humanitarian contacts; non-governmental organizations; and combating the illicit trafficking of drugs, weapons and radioactive materials, all acts of terrorism, illegal migration and transborder organized crime. 7. In its programme of work for the near future, the Cooperation Council will focus on the theme of economic cooperation. It is in the process of finalizing its secondary statutory documents and establishing a Turkic business council and a Turkic academy. Other earmarked projects include the setting-up of a Turkic scientific research fund, a Turkic inter-university union and a joint court of arbitration. II. Structure 8. The Nakhchivan Agreement defines the following as the principal organs of the Cooperation Council: the Council of Heads of State, the Council of Foreign Ministers, the Senior Officials Committee, the Council of Elders of Turkic-speaking States and the General Secretariat. The rules of procedure also envisage a Chairman-in-Office, serving on a rotating basis. The Council of Heads of State is to meet once a year to review progress and define priorities for the Cooperation Council. The Council of Foreign Ministers is the principal decision-making body of the organization. The Council of Elders serves as an advisory body of eminent personalities. The General Secretariat is entrusted with secretarial functions, employing international civil servants from Cooperation Council member States. 9. The Nakhchivan Agreement also refers, in the context of the Cooperation Council process, to related bodies that perform their functions in accordance with their basic instruments: the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-speaking Countries and the International Organization of Turkic Culture. These bodies are to support the work of the Cooperation Council within their specific fields of cooperation. A/66/141 IV. Relations with other organizations 10. The Cooperation Council has already engaged in interaction with other regional intergovernmental organizations. Priority is given to organizations of which all Cooperation Council countries are members. As a result of consultations with the Economic Cooperation Organization, it was agreed that practical cooperation was to be started forthwith and that the Economic Cooperation Organization would finalize procedures to grant observer status to the Cooperation Council as soon as possible. Cooperation on a similar basis with the Organization of the Islamic Conference is currently under consideration. Observer status in the General Assembly 11. As an intergovernmental organization dedicated to strengthening peace and stability, enhancing dialogue, promoting cooperation and disclosing the potential for common development among its member States, the Cooperation Council fully adheres to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. By promoting deeper relations and solidarity among Turkic-speaking countries, it serves as a new regional instrument for enriching international cooperation in the Central Asian and Caucasian regions. 12. Given the clear complementarity of their goals, granting of observer status in the General Assembly to the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States would initiate a mutually beneficial institutional dialogue between the two organizations. It would bring about coherence of efforts and open avenues for future cooperation in specific areas. Furthermore, obtaining observer status would greatly assist the Cooperation Council in its endeavours to foster regional initiatives among its members aimed at integration.

Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 do so from hunger-related illness, and that, as estimated by the Food and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (C 2006/REP), appendix G. A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are undernourished is about 925 million worldwide, and that an additional 1 billion people are suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences on the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries; 5. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 8. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; 9.

Recognizes the advances reached through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 11. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development are essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 12. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets, and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 13. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 1° 14. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity!! and to consider becoming parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture !2 as a matter of priority; 15. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples'® and acknowledges that many indigenous’ organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 16. Notes the need to further examine various concepts such as, inter alia, “food sovereignty” and their relation with food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 17. Requests all States and private actors, as well as_ international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 18. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 12 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the Conference of FAO, Thirty-first Session, Rome, 2-13 November 2001 (C 2001/REP), appendix D. A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 19.

Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 23. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in this regard, and invites once again all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security’ and the United Nations Millennium Declaration;* 24. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 25. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 26. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 27. Also stresses that States parties to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights!4 should consider implementing that agreement in a manner that is supportive of food 14 See Legal Instruments Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, done at Marrakesh on 15 April 1994 (GATT secretariat publication, Sales No. GATT/1994-7). A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 security, while mindful of the obligation of Member States to promote and protect the right to food; 28. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently occurring across Africa, in particular in the Horn of Africa, and expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to cut operations across different regions, including southern Africa; 29. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to continue to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 30.
