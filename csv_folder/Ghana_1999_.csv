they will never be produced again, Concerned also at the continued retention of the nuclear-weapons option by those three States that are nuclear-weapons-capable and that have not acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,' and concerned at their failure torenounce that option, Concerned further that negotiations on nuclear arms reductions are currently stalled, Bearing in mind that the overwhelming majority of States entered into legally binding commitments not to receive, manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosivedevices,

more difficult, Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug-trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money-laundering and illicit traffic in arms, precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing the need for international

and balanced approach with strategies, measures, methods, practical activities, goals and specific targets to be met, that all States, the United Nations system and other international organizations
