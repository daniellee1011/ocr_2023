Takes note of the report of the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights;* 2. Recalls the proposed elements for a conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between foreign debt and human rights, and encourages the independent expert to continue to develop them with a view to addressing the debt crisis in a just, equitable and sustainable manner; 3. Welcomes the areas of focus identified by the independent expert for the period 2009-2010, in particular the development of the general guidelines on foreign debt and human rights and the issue of illegitimate debt and, in that regard, requests the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to assist the independent expert in the organization and holding of additional consultations with experts and Governments on these issues, including through the allocation of sufficient budgetary resources; 4. Also welcomes the three regional multi- stakeholder consultations on the general guidelines on foreign debt and human rights, held in Santiago de Chile, on 18 June 2010, Addis Ababa, on 4 and 5 November 2010, and Doha, on 31 January and 1 February 2011, to obtain views on the form and content of the guidelines with a view to improving A/HRC/17/L.24 them, and encourages the widest possible participation of States and stakeholders from the public sector, the private sector, civil society and academia; 5. Recalls that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 6. Recognizes that structural-adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 7. Reaffirms that responses to the global financial and economic crises should not result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop debt relief measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human rights in affected countries; 8. Expresses its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long- term debt burden; 9. Reiterates its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the above-mentioned Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 10. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of middle- and low-income heavily indebted countries, and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, and by armed conflicts; 11. ‘Affirms that, from a human rights perspective, the settlement of excessive vulture funds has a direct negative effect on the capacity of Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights; 12. Also affirms that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of the problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the current system, and calls upon States to take measures to combat those vulture funds; 13. | Acknowledges that, in least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 14. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that A/HRC/17/L.24 debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 15. Recalls once again the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 16. Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 17. Recalls the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt servicing burdens of developing countries; 18. Stresses the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of broader social development goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of human rights; 19. Also stresses that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights; 20. Further stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 21. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting ongoing programmes; A/HRC/17/L.24 22. Calls upon creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and debtors alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to development projects, loan agreements or Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers; 23. Reaffirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 24. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 25. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 26. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 27. Requests the independent expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 28. Also requests the independent expert to continue to seek the views and suggestions of States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, regional economic commissions, international and regional financial institutions and non- governmental organizations on the general guidelines and his proposal of possible elements for consideration, and urges them to respond to his requests; 29. Encourages the independent expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Human Rights Council and its Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development in his work towards the elaboration of the general guidelines; 30. | Requests the independent expert to report to the General Assembly on the issue of the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 31. | Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular all the staff and resources required to carry out his functions, including the organization of consultations with experts and Governments on the general guidelines on foreign debt and human rights; 32.

The International Conference of Asian Political Parties was launched in Manila, in September 2000, to build bridges of political cooperation and to establish networks of mutual benefit among mainstream political parties in Asia, both ruling and in opposition. Over its first decade, the International Conference of Asian Political Parties has grown steadily in both membership and influence. As of May 2011, membership has reached more than 340 eligible political parties in 52 States and 1 territory in Asia. After establishing fraternal linkages and cooperation with the Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America and the Caribbean, in 2008, the International Conference of Asian Political Parties has also been undertaking efforts to reach out to the political parties in other continents, including in particular Africa. So far the International Conference of Asian Political Parties has held six general assemblies — in Manila (2000), Bangkok (2002), Beijing (2004), Seoul (2006), Astana (2009) and Phnom Penh (2010). These assemblies have brought together the Asian continent’s most prominent political leaders to search for ways of coexisting in a more peaceful, more democratic and more prosperous Asia. Its Standing Committee — made up of 18 leading political parties in 18 States — has met at least twice a year since 2004. The International Conference of Asian Political Parties has also organized special conferences on key continental issues since 2008 — 11-45870 Hil 240811 CA AM AAA A A/66/198 such as those of minimizing political corruption (Seoul, 2008), strengthening State capacity (Kathmandu, 2009), easing mass poverty (Kunming, 2010) and dealing with natural disasters (Kuala Lumpur, 2011). From its inception, the International Conference of Asian Political Parties has been a staunch supporter of the United Nations and its activities. The first paragraph of the preamble to the organization’s Charter, adopted in September 2006, declares the unequivocal commitment of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties to the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. Representatives of the political parties that took part in the sixth general assembly in Phnom Penh in December 2010 unanimously adopted a declaration endorsing the bid for observer status in the General Assembly of the United Nations. The International Conference of Asian Political Parties is also coordinating with the joint initiatives of Governments of other States Members of the United Nations towards the same objective. We believe that the International Conference of Asian Political Parties can play a major role in forging cooperation between the United Nations and the political parties of Asia, and those of Latin America and Africa in the future, the three continents of the emerging democracies, by aggregating and channelling to the United Nations system the views of the peoples in all their diversity, as expressed in political debates and discussions at all dimensions, local, national and continental, promoting people’s awareness, approval and support of international agreements reached at the United Nations, and building international consensus on United Nations action to meet key global challenges. In addition, the International Conference of Asian Political Parties can provide support for political parties in the emerging democracies and increase their capacity to carry out at the local and national level their law-making and oversight functions on matters subject to international cooperation at the United Nations.

Over its first decade, ICAPP has grown steadily in both membership and influence. As at the end of May 2011, its membership has reached more than 340 eligible political parties in 52 States and 1 territory in Asia. So far, six general assemblies of ICAPP have been successfully held, in Manila in 2000, Bangkok in 2002, Beijing in 2004, Seoul in 2006, Astana in 2009 and Phnom Penh in 2010, and they have brought together political leaders in the region to exchange opinions and communicate with each other, and helped to strengthen unity among Asian States and propel Asia along the road towards stability and prosperity. The ICAPP Standing Committee, made up of 18 leading political parties in 18 States, has met at least twice a year since 2004. ICAPP has also been annually organizing special conferences on key continental issues since May 2008 — such as those on minimizing political corruption, strengthening State capacity, alleviating mass poverty and effectively handling natural disasters. Purpose Article 1 of the ICAPP Charter, adopted at the fourth general assembly in September 2006, stipulates the objectives of ICAPP as follows: (a) To promote exchanges and cooperation between political parties with various ideologies in Asia; (b) To enhance mutual understanding and trust among the peoples and countries in the region; (c) To promote regional cooperation through the unique role and channel of political parties; (d) To create an environment for sustained peace and shared prosperity in the region. Organizational structure Membership Article 2 of the ICAPP Charter stipulates that ICAPP “shall be open to all political parties in Asia with democratically elected members in the parliaments of their respective countries, which are Member States of the United Nations”. At the 5th meeting of the Standing Committee in June 2006, it was agreed to extend invitations to political parties in the Palestinian National Authority in an effort to render ICAPP activities more inclusive and representative of the diversities existing in the region. At the 8th meeting of the Standing Committee in November 2008, it was further agreed to apply two criteria to the political parties in Asia to be eligible A/66/198 for invitation to the future ICAPP activities: (1) political parties which have more than 1 per cent of elected seats in their parliaments; (2) political parties which have won more than 1 per cent of popular votes in their latest parliamentary elections, as certified and recognized by their national election commissions. According to these criteria, there are 341 political parties in 52 States and 1 territory in Asia that are eligible to participate in ICAPP activities as at the end of May 2011. General assembly According to article 4 of the ICAPP Charter, a general assembly is held once every two years on a rotational basis among the members, unless otherwise decided by the Standing Committee. In principle, it is held for three working days during the latter half of the year, and is composed of an opening session, plenary session and thematic committee meetings, special workshops on specific topics as approved by the Standing Committee and a closing session. Standing Committee According to articles 9 and 10 of the ICAPP Charter, a Standing Committee, composed of the representatives of 18 members from an equal number of countries, was established. The members of the Standing Committee serve for two years from the end of a general assembly until the end of the following general assembly. The Standing Committee makes decisions and lays out the procedures on issues regarding the organization of the ICAPP meetings, including the general assemblies and special conferences, as well as other issues regarding other ICAPP activities and programmes. Currently, the Standing Committee is composed of the representatives of the 18 leading political parties from 18 States representing different subregions of Asia, namely, Central Asia, North-East Asia, South Asia, South-East Asia, West Asia and Oceania, and has been meeting more than twice a year since 2004. Secretariat The permanent secretariat of ICAPP was established in Seoul by a decision unanimously taken at the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee in March 2009, and as endorsed at the fifth general assembly in September 2009. In accordance with article 12 of the ICAPP Charter, the secretariat executes such functions, among others, as (1) maintaining and updating the list of political parties and the official website; (2) providing necessary information and assistance to the ICAPP members; and (3) establishing contacts and promoting cooperation with other international or regional organizations. Financing Article 8 of the ICAPP Charter stipulates that the political parties hosting the general assembly shall bear the primary expenses of the general assemblies. The primary expenses include logistical arrangements, that is, conference facilities, domestic transportation and the like. The primary expenses shall not include, inter alia, international transportation to and from the location of the general assembly. For the purposes of holding the general assembly, the political parties hosting the A/66/198 general assemblies may seek voluntary contributions from members of ICAPP and other organizations. The ICAPP activities, namely the general assemblies, Standing Committee meetings and special conferences, are funded in principle by the political parties that host such events, which usually cover the costs of organizing conferences and minimum local accommodation for a limited number of representatives of political parties participating in the events. At the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee in March 2009, it was agreed that the budget and personnel to implement the functions of the ICAPP secretariat shall be initially provided by the host country. It was further agreed that the Standing Committee will continue to discuss issues relating to the budget and personnel of the secretariat. Since 2010, the Korea Foundation in Seoul has provided funds to support a part of the secretariat activities. Other administrative budgets, including office maintenance and personnel costs, are covered by private donations. Activities General assemblies So far, six ICAPP general assemblies have been held. The first was held in Manila in September 2000 with representatives of 46 political parties from 26 countries, the second in Bangkok in November 2002 with 77 parties from 35 countries, the third in Beijing in September 2004 with 81 parties from 35 countries, the fourth in Seoul in September 2006 with 92 parties from 36 countries, the fifth in Astana in September 2009 with 63 parties from 33 countries, and the sixth in Phnom Penh in December 2010 with 90 parties from 36 countries. These assemblies have brought together the Asian continent’s most prominent political leaders to search for ways of coexisting in a more peaceful, more democratic and more prosperous Asia. Special conferences Special conferences and workshops have also been convened for the ICAPP members on key challenges that the region is facing, such as prevention of political corruption, strengthening State capacity, alleviation of poverty and dealing with natural disasters. ICAPP is preparing to host another special conference on the issues relating to poverty alleviation in China in September 2011. Relations with other organizations Recently, ICAPP has been trying to reach out to other regions in the world. The first joint session with the Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America and the Caribbean was successfully held in Buenos Aires in July 2009. After establishing fraternal linkages and cooperation with the Permanent Conference of Political Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean, ICAPP has been undertaking efforts to reach out to the political parties in Africa, in coordination with the Permanent Conference of Political Parties of Latin America and the Caribbean, with a view to organizing the first trilateral meeting of political parties in Asia, Africa and Latin America in the near future. A/66/198 In this regard, ICAPP will play a key and continuing role not only in Asia’s inevitable movement to build an Asian community but also in the global quest for a more peaceful and prosperous world. Character of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties Although ICAPP is not an intergovernmental organization per se, the following points with regard to its legal status should be taken into consideration by the States Members of the United Nations: (a) ICAPP is unique in nature in that it is open to all political parties regardless of their political orientation; (b) The political parties participating in ICAPP activities are either responsible for forming the Governments in their respective countries and making most of their policies, or eligible to form future Governments depending on the results of elections; (c) ICAPP has also been channelling to the United Nations system the results of its political debates at all levels, local, national and continental, like submitting the Kunming Declaration on Poverty Alleviation, which was adopted at the special ICAPP conference in Kunming in July 2010, in time for the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals held two months later; (d) In addition, in recent years, ICAPP has been in close cooperation with political parties in other regions, namely, Latin America and Africa, with a view to forming a global forum of political parties and, in the case of Latin America, ICAPP and the Permanent Conference of Political Parties in Latin America and the Caribbean have been holding annual joint sessions to coordinate their activities to promote United Nations objectives. Reasons for seeking observer status for the International Conference of Asian Political Parties From its inception, ICAPP has been a staunch supporter of the United Nations and its activities. The first paragraph of the preamble to the ICAPP Charter, adopted in September 2006, declares the unequivocal commitment of ICAPP to the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations. Representatives of the political parties that took part in the sixth general assembly in Phnom Penh in December 2010 unanimously adopted a declaration that endorsed the ICAPP bid for observer status in the General Assembly of the United Nations. ICAPP will play a key and continuing role not only in Asia’s inevitable movement to build an Asian community but also in the global quest for a more peaceful and prosperous world. ICAPP can also play a major role in forging cooperation between the United Nations and the political parties not only of Asia but also of Latin America and Africa — the three continents of the emerging democracies — in the following areas: (a) Aggregating and channelling to the United Nations system the views of our peoples in all their diversity, as expressed in political debates and discussions at all dimensions, local, national and continental; A/66/198 (b) Promoting ordinary people’s awareness, approval and support of international agreements reached at the United Nations and through United Nations programmes; (c) Building international consensus on United Nations action to meet key global challenges; (d) Providing support for political parties in the emerging democracies — to increase their capacity to carry out at the local and national level their law-making and oversight functions on matters subject to international cooperation at the United Nations. In addition, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has been sending video messages to all major programmes of ICAPP, including the opening sessions of the fifth and sixth general assemblies, held in Astana and Phnom Penh, and the ICAPP special conference on poverty alleviation held in Kunming, and has provided valuable contributions and guidance to deliberations on the main themes of the conferences. More detailed information on ICAPP, including the address of the secretariat, the officers and the members of the Standing Committees, can be found on its website, at www.theicapp.org.

appreciation of the generous offer of Mauritius to assume the presidency of the Global Forum for 2012, Recognizing the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving societies and

and destination, especially in the light of the impact of the financial and economic crisis, and committing to ensuring dignified, humane treatment with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation, Emphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this regard,
