Vohidov Permanent Representative of the Republic of Uzbekistan to the United Nations A/62/194 Annex I [Original: Russian] Explanatory memorandum 1. The Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) is an international institution for promoting development established by an Agreement between the Governments of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation of 12 January 2006. The Bank began its work on 27 June 2006. EDB is an international organization and a subject of international law; it has international legal capacity and can, in particular, conclude international agreements within the purview of its competence. Under the Agreement mentioned above, the Bank is guided in its activities by the generally recognized principles and norms of international law applicable under international agreements and also adheres to the generally recognized principles of banking. The Bank and its bodies are prohibited by its charter from participating in political activity. Other States and international organizations may accede to the Agreement on the establishment of EDB. 2. The Bank’s mission is to promote the development of the market economy, economic growth and the expansion of trade and economic ties through investment activities, including the financing of large-scale investment projects, in the Eurasian area. The Bank facilitates the strengthening of international financial and economic cooperation, by participating in the work of other international financial and banking organizations and associations. In the future, EDB is expected to become a consolidating element in the financial infrastructure of the single economic space and a partner of member countries in expanding integration processes and equalizing the levels of socio-economic development of the member States of the Eurasian Economic Community. 3. In order to achieve its objectives, the Bank carries out the following basic functions: «It engages in investment activities by financing projects and programmes, providing guarantees and contributing to the registered capital of organizations, using its own capital and funds obtained on international and national financial markets as well as other available resources for this purpose; ¢ It advises the members of the Bank on questions of economic development, the effective use of resources, and the expansion of trade and economic ties and conducts information and analysis activities in the field of State and international finance; ¢ It cooperates with international organizations, States, national institutions and the economic entities of the member States of the Bank and other countries interested in financing economic development. A/62/194 EDB investment activities aim to modernize the energy, transport, communication and agro-industrial infrastructure, achieve structural improvements in the economies of member States and increase the output of high-technology products with high added value in non-commodity sectors. 4. The Bank’s registered capital consists of US$ 1.5 billion. The Bank is located in the city of Almaty, Republic of Kazakhstan. It is expected that, by the end of 2009, the value of the Bank’s investment project portfolio will exceed $3.5 billion and that of its assets will reach $5.5 billion. Accordingly, the Bank constitutes the largest integration project in our region in the financial and economic field. 5. We believe that powerful international institutions like the Eurasian Development Bank provide tangible assistance to socio-economic development and give further impetus to the processes of regional economic integration. Through its activities, the Bank is helping the countries in our region to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and is promoting their optimal inclusion in the world economy as full-fledged and advantageous partners. Thus, the activities of EDB as an international institution for promoting development are consonant with the purposes and principles of the United Nations in the socio-economic field. The Bank is one of the key regional partners of the United Nations system in our region. We are convinced that granting the Bank observer status in the General Assembly would help establish a firm basis for regular and well-organized cooperation between EDB and the United Nations in order to carry out the common and related tasks facing them.

Vohidov Permanent Representative of the Republic of Uzbekistan to the United Nations A/62/195 Annex I [Original: Russian] Explanatory memorandum The Treaty on the Establishment of the Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC) was signed on 10 October 2000 by the Presidents of the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Tajikistan. The Republic of Uzbekistan joined the Community in 2006 at the same time as the Organization of Central Asian Cooperation became part of EURASEC. The Republic of Armenia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine have the status of observer States in EURASEC. The Treaty on the Establishment of the Eurasian Economic Community affirms the commitment of the member States of the Community to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the generally recognized principles and norms of international law. The Community’s objectives are to: ¢ establish common regulations for trade in goods and services and their access to domestic markets, ¢ introduce a unified currency-regulation and currency-control procedure, ¢ draw up and implement joint programmes for socio-economic development, * create equal conditions for industrial and entrepreneurial activities, ¢ form a common transport-services market and a single transport system, ¢ form a common energy market, ¢ align closer and harmonize national legislation and also ensure cooperation among the legal systems of EURASEC States in order to establish a common legal space. The Inter-State Council, which is composed of the heads of State and Government of the Community countries, is the highest executive body of EURASEC. The Integration Committee is the Community’s standing administrative body. It is made up of the deputy heads of Government of the EURASEC countries. The Community Secretariat, located in Moscow (the Russian Federation) and Almaty (Kazakhstan), has the tasks of organizing and providing the information and A/62/195 technical support for the work of the Inter-State Council and the Integration Committee. The Secretariat is headed by the EURASEC Secretary-General, who is appointed by the Inter-State Council. Grigory Alekseevich Rapota has occupied this post since October 2001. The Commission of Permanent Representatives, who are appointed by the EURASEC heads of State, carries out the Community’s work during the intervals between meetings of the Integration Committee and ensures cooperation between the Community and the corresponding agencies, departments and organizations of the member countries. The EURASEC Inter-Parliamentary Assembly is made up of parliamentarians delegated by the parliaments of Community countries. It considers the questions of harmonizing (aligning, unifying) national legislation and bringing it into accordance with agreements concluded within the framework of EURASEC in order to achieve the Community’s objectives. The Community Court ensures the uniform implementation by the parties to the Treaty on the Establishment of the Eurasian Economic Community and the other agreements in force within the framework of the Community as well as decisions taken by its bodies and also considers economic disputes between EURASEC member States. The free trade regime is in operation in the territory of EURASEC without exception or restriction. At a meeting held in 2006 in Sochi, the Community heads of State adopted a decision on the formation of a customs union composed of the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation. Other EURASEC countries will join the customs union when they are ready to do so. The formation of an economic and currency union is a long-term objective. A visa-free travel regime is in operation: citizens of EURASEC member States, in accordance with an intergovernmental agreement, have the right, regardless of their place of permanent residence, to enter, leave, pass through in transit, travel within or stay in the territory of EURASEC States without a visa. The near-term priority areas in EURASEC activities also include: ¢ Transport: the establishment of a single transport space, solving the problem of single rates, increasing the flow of goods, simplifying customs procedures, completion of internal State procedures under agreements signed and the creation of transnational transport and shipping firms; ¢ Energy: the joint exploitation of hydro-energy complexes in Central Asia and solving the problem of electrical energy supply and water use, achieving a single energy balance, construction of hydroelectric power stations (the question of building hydroelectric power stations in Kyrgyzia and Tajikistan is currently under consideration in practical terms); ¢ Labour migration: the social protection of migrants, the establishment of an effective system for regulating and controlling the migration of labour resources, combating the criminality that accompanies migration and solving problems related to the payment of taxes by migrants and employers; A/62/195 ¢ Agro-industrial complex: coordinating the agricultural policy of the EURASEC States, forming a single foodstuffs market of the Community countries, reducing expenditures on the transport, storage, and sale of agricultural products, and establishing new market institutions in this area (insurance, banking, leasing, stock market and other institutions). EURASEC has had observer status in the United Nations General Assembly since 2003. The Community cooperates closely with the United Nations system in most of the basic areas of its activities. Its main partners are the European Economic Commission (EEC) of the United Nations, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries is one of the most important areas of the Community’s cooperation with the United Nations. The prospects for joint work with the United Nations system in the environmental, humanitarian and migration fields also appear to hold much promise. A memorandum of understanding between EURASEC and UNDP was signed in September 2006 in order to strengthen the institutional framework for cooperation between the Community and United Nations structures. An agreement on cooperation between the EURASEC Inter-Parliamentary Assembly and the United Nations European Economic Commission was concluded on 25 January 2007. In this way, favourable initial conditions for mutually advantageous cooperation between the United Nations and EURASEC have been created. Nevertheless, it is obvious that, in order to strengthen the practical component of this cooperation, ensure its synergistic effect enabling both organizations to attain common objectives in the socio-economic field, particularly the timely achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed objectives, there is a need to place relations between the Community and the United Nations on a more systematic basis. This is precisely the purpose of the General Assembly resolution, the of which has also been attached.
