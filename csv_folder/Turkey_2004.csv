Encourages Member States, in order to effectively counter smuggling networks, to conduct backtracking law enforcement investigations, where appropriate, to identify the source of the seized chemical precursors and those responsible for the consignment and ultimately the diversion and to investigate the possibility of establishing operational chemical profiling programmes, and invites all States to support, to the extent possible, such programmes and to ensure that effective control and monitoring mechanisms are in place in order to prevent diversion; 9. Reaffirms the importance of paragraphs 8 and 9 of its resolution 1995/20 of 24 July 1995 in helping the International Narcotics Control Board to monitor E/CN.7/2004/L.17 international trade so that diversion attempts can be identified, preventing chemical precursors from reaching the illicit market; 10. Urges the International Narcotics Control Board to continue to follow up all such cases of diversion by facilitating investigations by national authorities and to make its findings available to Governments through its annual report; 11. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the necessary resources to the International Narcotics Control Board to enable it to effectively continue its work under Operation Purple, Operation Topaz and Project Prism; 12. Requests the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, within the framework of his biennial reports on the implementation of the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly and taking into account the relevant resolutions adopted on the subject since the special session, to include in his report on the control of precursors, starting with his report to be submitted to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its forty-eighth session, recommendations on how to strengthen the use of the pre-export notification mechanism and ensure timely responses.",03/15/2004,2004_555661,Turkey,"* On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States. 1 General Assembly resolution S-20/2, annex, para. 14.",yes
2004,Economic And Social Council,Commission On Human Rights,Forty-seventh session,3 (b) and 7,(c),"Colombia,* Iran (Islamic Republic of), Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey: revised",N/A,The Commission on Narcotic Drugs recommends to the Economic and Social,"Council the adoption of the following resolution: Follow-up on strengthening the systems of control over chemical precursors and preventing their diversion and trafficking The Economic and Social Council, Concerned with the continued diversion and misuse of precursors and the fact that despite efforts undertaken by all States including the producing, exporting, importing and transit States, chemical substances are increasingly feeding the manufacture of illicit drugs of natural or synthetic origin, a problem that deserves the utmost attention of all States, Recalling the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session, devoted to countering the world drug problem together, in which Member States decided to establish the year 2008 as a target date for States to eliminate or considerably reduce the diversion of precursors,! Recalling also the Joint Ministerial Statement and further measures to implement the action plans emanating from the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, adopted during the ministerial segment of the forty-sixth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,? Stressing the importance of its resolutions 2003/32 of 22 July 2003, on training in precursor control, countering money-laundering and drug abuse prevention, and 2003/35, also of 22 July 2003, on strengthening the prevention and suppression of illicit drug trafficking, Recalling article 12, paragraphs 1, 9 (c) and 10, of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988,3 Reaffirming the importance of using all available legal means or measures to prevent the diversion of chemicals from legitimate trade to illicit drug manufacture as an essential component of comprehensive strategies against drug abuse and trafficking and of preventing access to chemical precursors by those engaged in or attempting to engage in the processing of illicit drugs, Reiterating the importance of the effective and real-time exchange of information relating to the interdiction, diversion and suspected diversion of precursors, as an essential component of strategies to facilitate comprehensive investigations into cases relating to such diversion, including the identification of the modus operandi and entities involved and the initiation of appropriate legal action, Encouraging Member States to conduct backtracking law enforcement investigations in order to counter organized smuggling networks effectively, Also encouraging Member States to facilitate the exchange of information between the relevant agencies in order to identify the sources of seized precursor chemicals and those responsible for the shipping and diversion of those substances and to identify the sources of pharmaceutical preparations misused for illicit drug manufacture, Noting that links are increasingly being uncovered between the smuggling of drugs and the smuggling of precursor chemicals, including the use of similar modi operandi to conceal consignments in order to avoid detection, Welcoming with satisfaction the results so far achieved under Operation Purple and Operation Topaz and the new initiative called Project Prism, which were launched by the International Narcotics Control Board, in cooperation with Member States, to enhance controls over chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of cocaine, heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants respectively, Concerned that, without additional resources, the International Narcotics Control Board will not be able to carry out its important functions under the above- mentioned operations, 1. Urges all Member States to put in place systems and procedures to ensure that the details of any interdiction, seizure, diversion or attempted diversion 2 A/58/124, sect.

E/CN.7/2004/L.17/Rev.1 of precursors are communicated expeditiously to all Governments concerned and the International Narcotics Control Board and, insofar as possible, share relevant information so that methods frequently used for the national and international trafficking in chemicals may be identified, pursuant to article 12 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988;4 2. Reiterates the importance of applying the “know-your-client” principle referred to in its resolution 2003/39 of 22 July 2003, and stresses the necessity of strengthening the use of the mechanism of pre-export notifications, including by providing timely responses, especially through the efficient sharing of information; 3. Invites those States which do not have mechanisms to enable the real- time exchange of information under the current international operations to consider establishing a national focal point or central national authority in line with the standard operating procedures of the international operations, through which all information on licit and illicit consignments can be channelled, and invites all Member States to contribute to updating the directory of competent national authorities under the international drug control treaties, with a view to implementing article 12 of the 1988 Convention; 4. Recommends that Member States develop or further adapt, where necessary, their regulatory and operational control procedures to counter the diversion of chemical substances into illicit drug production or manufacture, and encourages authorities to initiate or further strengthen coordination and cooperation between all regulatory and enforcement services involved in precursor control; 5. Invites Member States and appropriate international and regional bodies to review intelligence on the smuggling of drugs and the smuggling of precursor chemicals, in order to identify common links and to plan appropriate operations to stop such activities; 6. Encourages Member States to ensure that stopped diversion attempts receive the same investigative attention that would be afforded to a seizure of the same substance, since such cases could provide valuable intelligence that could prevent diversions elsewhere; 7. Emphasizes the need to ensure that adequate mechanisms are in place, where necessary and to the extent possible, to prevent the diversion of preparations containing chemicals listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 Convention, pertaining to licit drug manufacture, in particular those containing ephedrine and pseudo- ephedrine; 8.
