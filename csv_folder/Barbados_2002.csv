combating the contemporary manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Reaffirming its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally racism and racial discrimination, and its conviction that racism and racial discrimination, in all their forms and manifestations, constitute a total negation of the purposes and

at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, as a result of resurgent activities

should implement and enforce appropriate and effective legislation to prevent acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations, Emphasizing that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices which in turn generate more poverty, Recalling the adoption by the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, Noting with grave concern that despite the efforts of the international community,
