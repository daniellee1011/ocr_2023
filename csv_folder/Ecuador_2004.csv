Takes note of the reports of the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights (E/CN.4/2004/47 and Add.1 and 2), and stresses that structural adjustment reform programmes have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Recognizes that the structural adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, imposing fixed expenditure ceilings, and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 3. Expresses its concern at the fact that the options for macroeconomic policy of developing countries are constrained by demands for adjustment and that many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still carry very high external debt burdens relative to their gross national product; 4. Also expresses its concern that the majority of countries that reached the intermediate phase under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debt Initiative have yet to reach the final stage and that even for countries meeting all the criteria, the Initiative may not result in a sustainable debt burden; 5. Recognizes that for the heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers in the forms of grants and concessional loans, as well as removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 6. Regrets that up till now there has been little headway made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor within them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms; 7. Acknowledges that a lot of progress remains to be achieved towards a lasting solution to the debt problems of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, and that in several low- and middle-income countries unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals regarding development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 8. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals set out in the Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 9. Recalls, once again, the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 10. Calls upon the international community, including the United Nations system, and the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the World Conference on Human Rights and the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, and in this regard stresses the need: 10. (a) To implement speedily, effectively, fully and with continued flexibility with respect to the eligibility criteria the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, which should be fully financed through additional resources, taking into consideration, as appropriate, measures to address any fundamental changes in the economic circumstances of those developing countries that have an unsustainable debt burden caused by natural catastrophes, severe terms-of-trade shocks or conflict, taking into account initiatives which have been undertaken to reduce outstanding indebtedness; (b) To encourage exploring innovative mechanisms to comprehensively address the debt problems of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries and including middle-income countries and countries with economies in transition; 11. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration contained in the annex to resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 11. 12. Also recalls the conclusion of the statement on poverty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001, that some of the structural obstacles confronting developing States’ anti-poverty strategies lie beyond their control in the contemporary international order and that it is imperative that measures be taken urgently to remove these global structural obstacles, such as unsustainable foreign debt, the widening gap between rich and poor, and the absence of an equitable multilateral trade, investment and financial system; otherwise, the national anti-poverty strategies of some States have limited chance of sustainable 12. SUCCESS; 13. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven, with the participation of people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the national context, priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of 13. human rights; 14. Also stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 14. 15. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting the 15. ongoing programmes; 16. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 16. 17. Requests the independent expert to further explore, in his analytical annual report to the Commission, the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 17. 18. Also requests the independent expert, in the discharge of his mandate, to general guidelines to be followed by States and by private and public, national and international financial institutions in the decision-making and execution of debt repayments and structural reform programmes, including those arising from foreign debt relief, to ensure that compliance with the commitments derived from foreign debt will not undermine the obligations for the realization of fundamental economic, social and cultural rights, as provided for in the international human rights instruments, and to present a preliminary on this matter to the Commission at its sixty- first session and a final at the sixty-second session of the 18. Commission,; 19. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to carry out his functions; 19. 20. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 20. 21. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 21. 22. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 22. 23. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay particular attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 23.

I, resolution 1), Governments committed themselves to endeavouring to ensure that all men and women, especially those living in poverty, could exercise the rights, utilize the resources and share the responsibilities that would enable them to lead satisfying lives and to contribute to the well-being of their families, their communities and humankind and committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty throughout the world through national actions and international cooperation, as an ethical, social, political and economic imperative of humankind, Expressing its gratitude to the independent expert on extreme poverty for the important work accomplished during her mandate and recognizing the necessity of continuing the ongoing study, Welcoming the observation by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in his report (E/CN.4/2004/12) that the struggle against poverty must remain at the forefront of the human rights agenda, Recalling the report of the Secretary-General on women’s real enjoyment of their human rights, in particular those relating to the elimination of poverty, economic development and economic resources (E/CN.4/1998/22-E/CN.6/1998/11), Recalling also its resolution 2003/22 of 22 April 2003 on women’s equal ownership of, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing, which recognizes that restrictions on women’s equal access to credit and loans and factors preventing them from owning and inheriting land may contribute to the feminization of poverty, Recalling with interest the statement on poverty and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in May 2001, aimed at encouraging the integration of human rights into poverty eradication policies by outlining how human rights generally, and the International Covenant in particular, can empower the poor and enhance anti-poverty strategies, Stressing the necessity of better understanding the causes and consequences of extreme poverty, Noting that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has chosen the eradication of poverty as a cross-cutting theme of its strategy for 2002-2007, Reaffirms that: (a) Extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate them;

(2) It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the societies in which they live and in the realization of human rights, and for people living in poverty and vulnerable groups to be empowered to help plan, implement and evaluate policies that affect them, thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development;

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1. Stresses that the proposal of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and, therefore, unacceptable; 11. 12. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office in Geneva; 12. 13. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 13. 14. Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 14. 15. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from non-represented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 15. 16. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 16. 17. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 17. 18. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 18. 19. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 19. 20. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 20. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 21. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of his mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 21. 22. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 22. Also requests the High Commissioner: 23. (a) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (b) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; () To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-first session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 24. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 25. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Right (JIU/REP/2003/6), in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 25. 26. Requests the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other intergovernmental bodies of the Organization regarding the management, programmes and 26. administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; Decides to consider this matter under the same agenda item at its 27. sixty-first session.
