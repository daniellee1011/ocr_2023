Agenda for Sustainable Development covers the issue of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which it proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”,

commitments on water security and sanitation in Africa, adopted at the sixth Africa Water Week, in 2016, and noting the Budapest Water Summit 2016 and its recommendations, the call for action of the high-level symposium on the theme “Sustainable Development Goal 6 and targets: ensuring that no one is left behind in access to water and sanitation”, held in Dushanbe in 2016, the seventh South Asian Conference on Sanitation, held in Islamabad in 2018, and the High-level International Conference on the International Decade for Action “Water for Sustainable Development”, held in Dushanbe in 2018, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2017 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation in 2015, an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 844 million people lack a basic water service, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.5 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation and 892 million people still practise open defecation, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow- onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, A/HRC/39/L.11 Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres, and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions, and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes, or practising open defecation, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the respect, promotion and protection of all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Recalling that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to the right to life and human dignity, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds, and with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, income levels or other relevant considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation A/HRC/39/L.11 entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note with appreciation of his report on the theme of the human rights to water and sanitation of forcibly displaced persons;! 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and _ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons at risk have equal access to effective remedies; 6. Notes with concern that, in spite of all efforts, gender inequalities still exist in the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 7. Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law; (b) To ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for persons at risk and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds; (c) To monitor continuously and analyse regularly the status of the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation and to enhance efforts to improve the availability, accessibility, quality and use of water-related data at local, national and regional levels, and to develop disaggregated and gender-responsive indicators and monitoring mechanisms; (d) To promote both women’s leadership and their full, effective and equal participation in decision-making on water and sanitation management, ensure that a gender- based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes, including measures to reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education, to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when ' A/ARC/39/55.

full enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls and the full implementation of all Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda, including Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls and target 3.1 on reducing global maternal mortality, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, and particularly in humanitarian settings, and that a dramatic and sustainable scaling up of quality treatment and health-care services, including high-quality emergency obstetric services and also of the number of trained, competent fistula surgeons and midwives, is needed to significantly reduce maternal and new-born mortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, Recognizing also that humanitarian settings may exacerbate pre-existing patterns and structures of discrimination and inequalities and further undermine access to health care, information and services, housing, water, sanitation, education and employment for women and girls, and that in affected areas access to essential services, such as health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, are disrupted owing to inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional health-care workers, basic medicines and health-care supplies and survivor-centred referral pathways for all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further that, in humanitarian settings, disintegrating judicial systems, gender-based discrimination and discrimination against refugees in host countries, fear of reprisals against their families or themselves, and the stigma associated with sexual and gender-based violence all prevent women and girl survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and those denied access to sexual and reproductive health-care services from reporting sexual violence and seeking justice, accountability and remedies for the violations they have endured, Deeply concerned that women and girls living in humanitarian settings are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of violation of their rights, including through trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, and lack of accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, and lack of access to water and sanitation, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates between countries, but also within countries, and between women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, which creates the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Deeply concerned that in countries affected by humanitarian situations, the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54 compared to | in 180 globally, and that the majority of preventable maternal deaths have occurred in settings of armed conflict, natural disasters and displacement, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, both globally and in humanitarian settings, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Recognizing the need for further disaggregated data on maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and for access to sexual and reproductive health-care services in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, and recognizing the need to bridge the humanitarian- development divide, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and their review conference and outcome documents, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, good practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy and guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion in accordance with international human rights law and where not against national law, the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2. Urges States, in accordance with obligations under relevant provisions of international human rights law, including the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, to ensure the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care services, including mental health care and psychosocial services and sexual and reproductive health- care services, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 3. Calls upon States to pay special attention to the particular situation of adolescent girls in humanitarian settings, who may have to assume adult responsibilities and are exposed to higher risks of sexual and gender-based violence, child, early and forced marriage and trafficking, and are likely to be denied education, skills training, safe employment opportunities and access to sexual and reproductive health-care services and information, and to face isolation, discrimination and stigma, mental health issues and risk- taking behaviour; 4. Encourages all stakeholders to consider promoting and using the Inter- Agency Standing Committee’s Guidelines for Integrating Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action, the its Gender Handbook and the Inter-agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings, and to ensure delivery of the Minimum Initial Service Package for Reproductive Health at the onset of humanitarian emergencies, with particular attention to women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and in situations of vulnerability, and to ensure a transition, as soon as possible, towards comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services, information and evidence-based education; 5. Encourages Governments, local authorities, the United Nations system and regional organizations, and invites donors and other assisting countries, to address the vulnerabilities and capacities of women and girls through gender-responsive programming, including with regard to sexual and reproductive health needs and the means to address sexual and gender-based violence and various forms of exploitation during emergencies and in post-disaster environments, and the allocation of resources in their disaster risk reduction, response and recovery efforts in coordination with the Governments of affected countries; 6. Strongly urges States and all parties to armed conflict to take effective measures to prevent and address acts of violence, attacks and threats against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities in armed conflict, including through the development of domestic legal frameworks to ensure respect for their relevant international legal obligations; 7. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,* and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 8. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, including by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data, and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 9. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect women’s bodily autonomy and privacy and the equal right to decide autonomously in matters regarding their own lives and health by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights law and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviours that are discriminatory; 10. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 aimed at preventing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, including those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, including in humanitarian settings, such as by informing women of their rights under relevant international and domestic law, and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 11. Further urges States to ensure accountability and gender-sensitive, prompt and effective remedies for the violation of the rights of women and girls in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings by including transparent forms of monitoring, review and oversight of humanitarian programmes and policies, including the monitoring of inequities; 12.

the recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,’ as well as the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, adopted in Rome on 21 November 2014,° Acknowledging that the right to food has been recognized as the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate, nutritious food, in conformity with, inter alia, the culture, beliefs, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of individuals, that is produced and consumed sustainably, thereby preserving access to food for future generations, Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted in Rome on 16

the promotion and conservation of historical, cultural and natural heritage, traditional customs and culture, halting the loss of biodiversity and the improvement of the living conditions of people living in rural areas, Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that they must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food and nutrition security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the Declaration of the World Food Summit and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations ° See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document WSFS 2009/2. 2/11 contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, as well as in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and that these problems are increasing dramatically in some regions in the absence of urgent, determined and concerted action, Recognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, the least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility of commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe food insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, prevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, Stressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon Member States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to take further steps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of affected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national strategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition, Reaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited under international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to food, Stressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and nutrition availability, 3/11 Stressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Concerned that the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are harming agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus contributing to food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to increase with future climate change, Expressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the enjoyment of the right to food, Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and nutrition security and the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security!° by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in

International Conference on Nutrition, hosted by the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014, and of its outcome documents, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, Stressing also the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture and nutrition, Recognizing that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, Recognizing also the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and nutrition and the right to food for all, Noting the cultural values of dietary and eating habits in different cultures, and recognizing that food plays an important role in defining the identity of individuals and communities and is a cultural component that describes and gives value to a territory and its inhabitants, 10 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document CL 144/9 (C 2013/20), appendix D. ""| Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document C 2015/20, appendix D. 4/11 Recognizing the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations as the key United Nations agency for rural and agricultural development and its work in supporting the efforts of Member States to achieve the full realization of the right to food, including through its provision of technical assistance to developing countries in support of the implementation of national priority frameworks, Recognizing also the role of the Committee on World Food Security as an inclusive international and intergovernmental platform for a broad range of committed stakeholders to work together in a coordinated manner and in support of country-led processes towards the elimination of hunger and ensuring food security and nutrition for all human beings, Acknowledging the contribution of parliamentarians nationally and regionally to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition and ultimately to the realization of the right to food, and in this regard recognizing the convening of the first Global Parliamentary Summit against Hunger and Malnutrition, held in Madrid on 29 and 30 October 2018, Recalling the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we want”, and recalling the commitment therein to work together to promote sustained and inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental protection and thereby to benefit all, endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/288 of 27 July 2012, Recalling also the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030” and its guiding principles, which, inter alia, recognize the importance of promoting regular disaster preparedness and response and recovery exercises, with a view to ensuring rapid and effective response to disasters and related displacement, including access to essential food and non-food relief supplies, as appropriate to local needs, as well as of fostering collaboration across global and regional mechanisms and institutions for the implementation and coherence of instruments and tools relevant to disaster risk reduction, such as for climate change, biodiversity, sustainable development, poverty eradication, environment, agriculture, health, food and nutrition and others, as appropriate, Recalling further the proclamation at its seventieth session of 2016—2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition, and stressing the opportunity the Decade represents to bring together initiatives and efforts to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition, Acknowledging the work done by the High-level Task Force on Global Food and Nutrition Security established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the Secretary-General in his continuing efforts in this regard, including continued engagement with Member States and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food, 1. Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, up to 45 per cent of the children who die every year before the age Resolution 69/283, annex II. 5/11 of 5 die from undernutrition and hunger-related illness and that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people in the world affected by undernourishment, or chronic food deprivation, increased from around 804 million in 2016 to nearly 821 million in 2017; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people in the world is unacceptably high, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries and the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2016, reaching an estimated 821 million in 2017; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8. Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue to mainstream a gender perspective in the fulfilment of her mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity and malnutrition to continue to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 9. Reaffirms the need to ensure that programmes delivering safe and nutritious food are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities; 10. Stresses that the primary responsibility of States is to promote and protect the right to food and that the international community should provide, through a coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in support of national and regional efforts by providing the assistance necessary to increase food production and access to food, including through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food aid, ensuring food security, with special attention to the specific needs of women and girls, and promoting innovation, support for the development of adapted technologies, research on rural advisory services and support for access to financing services, and ensure support for the establishment of secure land tenure systems; 6/11 11.

Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, including private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle water scarcity; 16. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation 3 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 and A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.

Also recalls the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held on 22 and 23 September 2014,!* and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; 23. Notes the need to further examine various concepts, such as “food sovereignty”, and their relation to food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 24. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all; 25.
