also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the adverse impacts of climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, and noting also that

Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019: Safeguarding against Economic Slowdowns and Downturns, the number of hungry people in the world is growing, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries and 2 billion people in the world experience moderate or severe food insecurity; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8.

Recognizes the advances made through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 15. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and responsible public investment in rural development, taking into consideration the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems,'? as endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security, is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investment, including private investment, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and to tackle water scarcity; 16. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation 4 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 and A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.

Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, !* acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face in achieving the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 22. Also recalls the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly known as the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, held on 22 and 23 September 2014,!° and the commitment to developing, in conjunction with the indigenous peoples concerned and where appropriate, policies, programmes and resources to support indigenous peoples’ occupations, traditional subsistence activities, economies, livelihoods, food security and nutrition; 23. Notes the need to further examine various concepts, such as “food sovereignty”, and their relation to food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 24.

Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers and legal guardians, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to their family, benefiting the child directly; 31.

I, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.1.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. ' World Health Organization/United Nations Children’s Fund, Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: Special Focus on Inequalities. 2019 updates and SDG baselines (Geneva, 2019). 3/8 are more likely to lack access to basic drinking water and to basic sanitation than people living in unaffected countries, Deeply concerned further that women and girls often face, especially in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation, as well as menstrual hygiene management, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water and of care responsibilities, including those arising from waterborne diseases, in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, such as education and leisure, or, for women, for earning a livelihood, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children the hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years old, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation and that, in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, Deeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are accessible and appropriate to their needs, which impacts on their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is particularly concerning in the situation of homelessness, as well as in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilian objects in armed conflict, which may injure personnel and cut off the power that keeps water, sanitation and hygiene systems running, Deeply concerned that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and education thereon, are excluded and stigmatized, that their health can be negatively impacted, and that they are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned also that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education and the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recognizing that women have specific hygiene needs during menstruation, pregnancy, childbearing and rearing and throughout the life course, Deeply concerned further that women and girls are particularly at risk and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, Deeply concerned that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively affect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and _ that, according to the annual United Nations World Water Development Report, over 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater, and over 95 per cent in some developing countries, is released into the environment without treatment, Affirming the importance of regional and international cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to 4/8 safe drinking water and sanitation, with the understanding that it has no bearing on the issues of international water law, including international watercourse law, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling the need to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island States and rural and local communities, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, 1. Reaffirms that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, are essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights; 2. Recognizes that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 3. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note of his reports; 4. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and to endeavour to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical cooperation, to the maximum of their available resources, with a view to progressively achieving the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including, in particular, the adoption of legislative measures; 5. Calls upon States: (a) To ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for individuals belonging to groups at risk and those who are marginalized on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds;

(d) To ensure access to safe and affordable drinking water and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all women and girls, as well as for menstrual hygiene management, including for hygiene facilities and services in public and private spaces; (ce) To take measures to empower women and girls for preparedness in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, by ensuring access to water and sanitation services and implementing gender-responsive policies, plans and programmes that address, inter alia, effective menstrual hygiene management and adequate disposal options for menstrual products, without compromising their safety and dignity; (f) To address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by promoting educational and health practices in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and by ensuring access to factual information thereon, including for men and boys, addressing the negative social norms around the issue, as well as ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender-sensitive facilities, including disposal and waste management options for menstrual products, while recognizing that women’s and girls’ attendance at school, university or, for women, work, can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, public places and, for women, the workplace; (g) To promote both women’s leadership and their full, effective and equal participation in decision-making on water and sanitation management and to ensure that a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes; (h) To reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education, including through improved public services and infrastructure; (i) To promote safe public spaces and improve the security and safety of women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and infrastructure when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or practising open defecation and urination; (j) To protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their home or practising open defecation and urination, including through promoting safe public spaces and improving the security and safety of women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and infrastructure; (k) To progressively eliminate open defecation by adopting policies to increase access to sanitation, including for individuals who are vulnerable or marginalized; (1) To take steps to promote action to raise international awareness on the issue of water-borne diseases, in particular cholera and child diarrhoea, which can be 'T Resolution 71/256, annex. 6/8 prevented through safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene and engaging in partnerships with relevant stakeholders to implement projects aimed at scaling up access to safe water and sanitation in developing countries; (m) To apply broad and inclusive participatory approaches and consulting and coordinating with local communities and other stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable and non-discriminatory access to safe drinking water and sanitation; (n) To enhance efforts to substantially reduce the share of untreated wastewater released into the environment and to ensure that plans and programmes for improving sanitation services take into account the need for appropriate systems for the treatment of wastewater produced, including disposal of infant faeces, with the aim of reducing the risks to human health, drinking water resources and the environment; (0) To identify patterns of failure to respect, protect or fulfil the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all persons without discrimination and to address their structural causes in policymaking and budgeting within a broader framework, while undertaking holistic planning aimed at achieving sustainable universal access, including in instances where the private sector, donors and non-governmental organizations are involved in service provision; (p) To provide for effective accountability mechanisms for all water and sanitation service providers, including private sector providers, to ensure that they respect human rights and do not cause or contribute to human rights violations or abuses; 6. Calls upon States and international organizations to provide financial resources, help capacity-building and technology transfer to help countries upon their request, in particular developing countries, to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all; 7. Calls upon non-State actors, including business enterprises, both transnational and others, to comply with their responsibility to respect human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, including by cooperating with State investigations into allegations of abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and by progressively engaging with States to detect and remedy abuses of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 8. Stresses the important role of the international cooperation and technical assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and invites regional and international organizations to complement efforts by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation in accordance with their respective mandates; 9.
