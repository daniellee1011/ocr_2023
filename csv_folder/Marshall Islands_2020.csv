human rights obligations and commitments operationally directed at respecting, promoting, protecting and fulfilling human rights, and at preventing human rights violations, Welcoming the commitment of States to leave no one behind, and recalling that the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration, is included as the standalone target 16.9 in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable

protection, protection in emergencies, access to financial and economic resources, the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and children everywhere, and access to quality education, Welcoming the continuing efforts of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other treaty-based bodies towards universal birth registration, such as through recommendations

unregistered individuals may have limited or no access to services and the enjoyment of all the rights to which they are entitled, including the rights to a name and to acquire a nationality, and rights relating to health, education, property and inheritance, social welfare, work and political participation, and taking into consideration that registering a person’s birth is a vital step

planning and implementation of programmes and policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that non-governmental

sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights, and resolution 74/141 of 18 December 2019, Reaffirming all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, Council resolution 39/8 of 27 September 2018, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International

the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to the right to life and human dignity, Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that human rights must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the GE.20-12504(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/45/L.28 same emphasis, and that it is the duty of States to promote and protect all human rights, and which also reaffirms the right to development, Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which States pledged to leave no one behind, Recalling that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development covers the issue of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also that 10 years after the recognition of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, integrated approaches that support the practical realization of the human rights to water and sanitation, particularly by tackling inequalities and ensuring special attention to the needs and rights of all women and girls, are more pertinent than ever before, also in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the need to pursue these integrated approaches to the implementation of Goal 6 and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals that reflect the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and personal hygiene, in particular for women and girls, to enable menstrual management in a dignified and healthy way, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water and to reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity, Recalling General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which the Assembly proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, Noting the work of the High-level Panel on Water, jointly convened by the United Nations and the World Bank Group, in order to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation-related services in line with Sustainable Development Goal 6 and taking note of its outcome document of 14 March 2018, Noting also the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2019 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report of the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2019, 1.6 billion people gained access to safe drinking water between 2000 and 2017 and that an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 785 million people lack a basic water service, 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.2 billion people lack access to a safely managed sanitation service and 673 million people still practise open defecation, Deeply alarmed about the fact that, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, scarcity of water could displace an estimated 700 million people by 2030, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and A/HRC/45/L.28 Hygiene has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms by which to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Recognizing that sustained access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities is essential to preventing infectious diseases and that people without or with inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are at a much higher risk of contracting and passing on diseases, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities and that those most at risk are persons in vulnerable and marginalized situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, and gravely concerned that 3 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home, which is the most effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable and marginalized situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island developing States and the least developed countries, rural and local communities and people facing desertification, land degradation, drought and water scarcity, as well as rising water levels due to storm surges, sea level rise and flooding, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water, when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or when, in the absence of adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, which limits their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, A/HRC/45/L.28 Deeply concerned also that persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities, as such facilities are often inaccessible and inappropriate for meeting their needs, which affects their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is further exacerbated in particular in the situation of homelessness, in informal settlements and in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed that water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or during natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability, and reaffirming also the importance of taking steps with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, tenure status, income levels or other related considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of achieving universal access to safe, affordable and adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030 and of adequate and new sources of funding, including innovative financing, Stressing also the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have sustained access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and takes note with appreciation of his reports; 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and_ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the A/HRC/45/L.28 relevant Sustainable Development Goals; urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach that includes menstrual health management when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;_and invites regional and international organizations to complement the efforts made by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in accordance with their respective mandates; 5.

Assembly on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in particular resolution 64/292 of 28 July 2010, in which the Assembly recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights, and resolution 74/141 of 18 December 2019, Reaffirming all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, Council resolution 39/8 of 27 September 2018, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Recalling also that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to the right to life and human dignity, Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that human GE.20-12836(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 rights must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis, and that it is the duty of States to promote and protect all human rights, and which also reaffirms the right to development, Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which States pledged to leave no one behind, Recalling that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development covers the issue of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also that 10 years after the recognition of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, integrated approaches that support the practical realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, particularly by tackling inequalities and ensuring special attention to the needs and rights of all women and girls, are more pertinent than ever before, also in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the need to pursue these integrated approaches to the implementation of Goal 6 and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals that reflect the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and personal hygiene, in particular for women and girls, to enable menstrual hygiene management in a dignified and healthy way, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water and to reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity, Recalling General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which the Assembly proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, Noting the work of the High-level Panel on Water, jointly convened by the United Nations and the World Bank Group, in order to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation-related services in line with Sustainable Development Goal 6 and taking note of its outcome document of 14 March 2018, Noting also the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2019 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report of the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2019, 1.6 billion people gained access to safe drinking water between 2000 and 2017 and that an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 785 million people lack a basic water service, 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.2 billion people lack access to a safely managed sanitation service and 673 million people still practise open defecation, Deeply alarmed about the fact that, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, scarcity of water could displace an estimated 700 million people by 2030, A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms by which to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Recognizing that sustained access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities is essential to preventing infectious diseases and that people without or with inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are at a much higher risk of contracting and passing on diseases, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities and that those most at risk are persons in vulnerable and marginalized situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, and gravely concerned that 3 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home, which is the most effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable and marginalized situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island developing States and the least developed countries, rural and local communities and people facing desertification, land degradation, drought and water scarcity, as well as rising water levels due to storm surges, sea level rise and flooding, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water, when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or when, A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 in the absence of adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, which limits their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, Deeply concerned also that persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities, as such facilities are often inaccessible and inappropriate for meeting their needs, which affects their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is further exacerbated in particular in the situation of homelessness, in informal settlements and in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed that water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or during natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability, and reaffirming also the importance of taking steps with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, tenure status, income levels or other related considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of achieving universal access to safe, affordable and adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030 and of adequate and new sources of funding, including innovative financing, Stressing also the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international cooperation and technical assistance, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have sustained access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and takes note with appreciation of his reports; 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and_ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals; urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach that includes menstrual health management when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; and invites regional and international organizations to complement the efforts made by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in accordance with their respective mandates; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons in vulnerable situations have equal access to effective remedies; 6.

Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law;

set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing

to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in

the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, or primary caregivers and legal guardians, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, A/HRC/45/L.48 Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1.

non-discrimination, participation, survival and development, provide the framework for all actions concerning children, Reaffirming also that the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires its States parties to pursue the full implementation of the rights of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution, and that States parties have agreed that the education of the child shall be directed to, among others, the development of respect for the natural environment, Recalling the 2016 Day of General Discussion of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which focused on the contents and the implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child with regard to environmental matters, and taking note of its outcome report and recommendations, Welcoming the attention paid by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council to the rights of the child in the context of their respective mandates, in particular the work of the Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Reaffirming that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, that the best interests of the child shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his or her nurture and protection, and that families’ and caregivers’ capacities to provide the child with care and a safe environment should be promoted, including in the context of natural disasters, the adverse impacts of climate change or other forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1.
