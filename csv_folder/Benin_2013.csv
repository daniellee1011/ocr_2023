improved sanitation facilities, including more than 1.04 billion people who still practice open defecation, as defined by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in their 2013 update on the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, and that these figures do not fully capture the dimensions of water safety, the affordability of services and the safe management of excreta and wastewater, as well as equality, non-discrimination and differences between urban and rural areas, and therefore underestimate the numbers of those without access to safe drinking water and sanitation, Noting that the target of the Millennium Development Goals of halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water was formally met five years ahead of schedule, and deeply concerned that the world remains off track to meet the sanitation component of the same target, which called for halving the proportion of the population without sustainable access to an improved sanitation facility, that by 2015, if current trends continue, the world is set to miss the target by more than half a billion people, and that inexistent or inadequate sanitation facilities and serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can have a negative impact on water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water,

sanitation-related 2/4 diseases, and that girls in large parts of the world do not go to school for lack of separate toilets for girls, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the promotion

emphasis, Acknowledging the importance of equal access to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as an integral component of the realization of all human rights, Recalling that the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use and to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure and acceptable, and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, 1.

Stresses the important role of the international cooperation and technical assistance provided by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, as well as by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Millennium Development Goals, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action related to the right to safe drinking water and sanitation; 12.
