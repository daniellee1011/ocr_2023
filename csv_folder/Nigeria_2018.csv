2018,General Assembly,N/A,Seventy-second session,12,Improving global road safety,"Armenia, Belarus, Germany, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Poland, Russian Federation, Samoa, Thailand, Turkmenistan and Uruguay",N/A,Improving global road safety,"The General Assembly, Recalling its resolutions 57/309 of 22 May 2003, 58/9 of 5 November 2003, 58/289 of 14 April 2004, 60/5 of 26 October 2005, 62/244 of 31 March 2008, 64/255 of 2 March 2010, 66/260 of 19 April 2012, 68/269 of 10 April 2014 and 70/260 of 15 April 2016, on improving global road safety, Having considered the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report on improving global road safety! and the recommendations contained therein, Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of this Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, Recalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and acknowledging the importance of reaching the road safety-related targets, such as target 3.6, which aims to halve, by 2020, the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, and target 11.2, which aims to provide, by 2030, access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older ' A/72/359, Please recycle ae a 18-05464 1 100418 A A A A persons, as well as road safety targets aimed at strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity vis-a-vis hazards and developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure, Noting that, as the end of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 is approaching, the overwhelming majority of road traffic deaths and injuries are preventable and that, despite some improvements in many countries, including in developing countries, they remain a major public health and development problem that has broad social and economic consequences which, if unaddressed, may affect progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that human suffering, combined with costs to some countries of up to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product a year, makes reducing road traffic deaths and injuries both an economic and a social priority, especially for some countries, and that investment in road safety has a positive impact on public health and the economy, Taking into account that road traffic deaths and injuries are also a social equity issue, as the poor and the vulnerable are most frequently also vulnerable road users, namely, pedestrians, cyclists, users of motorized two- and three-wheeled vehicles and passengers of unsafe public transport, who are disproportionately affected and exposed to risks and road crashes, which can lead to a cycle of poverty exacerbated by income loss, and recalling that the aim of road safety policies should be to guarantee protection to all users, Recognizing that road safety requires addressing broader issues of equitable access to mobility and that the promotion of sustainable modes of transport, in particular safe public transport and safe walking and cycling, is a key element of road safety, Taking into account the importance of strengthening institutional capacity and continuing international cooperation, including South-South and_ triangular cooperation, cooperation between countries that share roads across borders and cooperation among regional and international organizations, to further support efforts to improve road safety, particularly in developing countries, and providing, as appropriate, support to meet the goals of the Decade of Action and those of the 2030 Agenda, Emphasizing that, while each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the context of reaching the Sustainable Development Goals, international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources, Expressing its concern that the number of road traffic crashes remains unacceptably high, and crashes represent a leading cause of death and injury around the world, killing more than 1.3 million people and injuring as many as 50 million people a year, with 90 per cent of these casualties occurring in developing countries, and concerned also that road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death around the world for children and young people between 15 and 29 years of age, Expressing its concern also that at the current rate of progress, target 3.6 will not be met, Expressing its concern further that the adoption and implementation of road safety measures remain inadequate in many countries, Acknowledging the leading role of Oman and the Russian Federation in drawing the attention of the international community to the global road safety crisis, 2/9 Commending Member States that have taken a leadership role by adopting comprehensive legislation on key risk factors, including the non-use of seat belts, child restraints and helmets, the drinking of alcohol and driving, and speeding, and drawing attention to other risk factors, such as low visibility, medical conditions and medicines that affect safe driving, fatigue and the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic and psychoactive substances, mobile phones and other electronic and texting devices, Encouraging Member States to promote multi-stakeholder partnerships to address the safety of vulnerable road users, the delivery of first aid to victims of road accidents or crashes, training and education, notably in developing and least developed countries, Recognizing the progress made by some Member States in providing road traffic crash victims and their families with universal access to health care in the pre-hospital, hospital, post-hospital and rehabilitation and reintegration phases, Acknowledging the work of the United Nations system, in particular the leadership of the World Health Organization, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, in establishing, implementing and monitoring various aspects of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020), and the commitment of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the International Labour Organization, among other entities, to supporting those efforts as well as that of the World Bank and regional development banks to implementing road safety projects and programmes, in particular in developing countries, Commending the World Health Organization for its leadership role in preventing road traffic injury and for its role in implementing the mandate conferred upon it by the General Assembly to act, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, as a coordinator on road safety issues within the United Nations system,” and anticipating the next Global Status Report on Road Safety, which will be the fourth in a series of reports to monitor progress over the period of the Decade of Action, as requested in Assembly resolution 62/244, Commending also the United Nations regional commissions for their work in increasing road safety activities and advocating increased political commitment to road safety, and in working towards setting regional and national road traffic casualty reduction targets, in particular the work of the Economic Commission for Europe in elaborating global road safety-related legal instruments, including international conventions and agreements, technical standards, resolutions and good practice recommendations, as well as in servicing 58 global and regional legal instruments that provide a commonly accepted legal and technical framework for the development of international road, rail, inland water and combined transport, Emphasizing the role of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration as a consultative mechanism to facilitate international road safety cooperation, Commending the work of two Economic Commission for Europe groups of experts, namely, on road signs and signals and on improving safety at level crossings, and recognizing the continuous work of the Global Forum for Road Traffic Safety and the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations to improve vehicle and road safety, Noting with approval the road safety performance review projects of the Economic Commission for Europe, carried out in collaboration with the Economic 3/9 and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean under the United Nations Development Account and with the Economic Commission for Africa with support from the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Road Safety, as well as the work of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia on prioritizing road safety to strengthen the national road safety management capacity of selected countries, and commending the development and implementation of road traffic safety management systems for different types of organizations, such as the extensive work of the International Organization for Standardization in developing the requirements for road traffic safety management systems,°* Acknowledging a number of other important international efforts on road safety, including the development by the International Road Transport Union of harmonized and internationally recognized standards for the vocational training of road transport professionals, as well as the development of an updated Road Safety Manual by the World Road Association to offer guidance to officials at various levels on measures that can enhance the safety of road infrastructure, Welcoming the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Road Safety, with secretariat support from the Economic Commission for Europe, in effectively mobilizing sustained high-level commitment to road safety by advocating adherence to and raising awareness about the United Nations legal instruments on road safety, sharing good practices, including through participation in global and regional conferences, and advocating for increased funds for road safety, Taking note of the report of the International Transport Forum of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development entitled Zero Road Deaths and Serious Injuries: Leading a Paradigm Shift to a Safe System, and the letter of intent of the International Transport Forum, the World Bank and the International Automobile Federation to develop regional road safety data observatories, and noting the promotion by the International Transport Forum of effective road injury prevention at the forthcoming Summit on Transport Safety and Security, to be held in Leipzig, Germany, from 23 to 25 May 2018, Recognizing the commitment of Member States and civil society to road safety, as demonstrated by their participation in United Nations Global Road Safety Week, including during the fourth Week, held from 8 to 14 May 2017, which highlighted the dangers of speed in order to generate action on measures to reduce speed and improve safety on the world’s roads, Recognizing also Member States and civil society for their continued commitment to road safety, as demonstrated by their observance of the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on the third Sunday of November every year, Acknowledging the efforts of Member States in contributing to international road safety by conducting research and collecting evidence that will inform policies, as well as by encouraging the sharing of best practices that enhance vehicle and infrastructure safety as well as human behaviour in road traffic, Recognizing that providing basic conditions and services to address road safety is primarily a responsibility of Governments, especially in view of the decisive role that legislative bodies can play in the adoption of comprehensive and effective road safety policies and laws and their implementation, while recognizing nonetheless that there is a shared responsibility to move towards a world free from road traffic fatalities and serious injuries and that addressing road safety demands 4/9 multi-stakeholder collaboration among the public and private sectors, academia, professional organizations, non-governmental organizations and the media, Commending the World Health Organization, along with the regional commissions and other United Nations system agencies, for facilitating a process to develop voluntary global performance targets and corresponding indicators for road safety, as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 70/260, as well as by the World Health Assembly in its resolution 69.7, adopted on 28 May 2016,* 1.

Takes note with appreciation of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between the realization of the right to work and the implementation of relevant targets of the Sustainable Development Goals;! 2. Reaffirms, as enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his or her living by work that he or she freely chooses or accepts, and that States should take appropriate steps to progressively achieve the full realization of that right, including technical and vocational guidance and training programmes, policies and techniques, to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development and full and productive employment under conditions safeguarding the fundamental political and economic freedoms of the individual; 3. Also reaffirms, as enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work that ensure, in particular, remuneration that provides all workers, as a minimum, with fair wages and equal remuneration for work of equal value without distinction of any kind, in particular women being guaranteed conditions of work not inferior to those enjoyed by men, with equal pay for equal work; a decent living for themselves and their families; safe and healthy working conditions; equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted in his or her employment to an appropriate higher level, subject to no considerations other than those of seniority and competence; and rest, leisure and reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay, and remuneration for public holidays; 4.

A/HRC/37/L.28 realization of the right to work by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures; 5. Recognizes that ensuring equality and non-discrimination in access to work is crucial in addressing the social prejudices and disadvantages that might exist in the labour market; 6. Stresses that the freedom to work, which is included in the right to work, entails the right to pursue professional options under equal conditions, especially for those whose freedom is frequently compromised by discriminatory legal provisions or forced labour, in particular women and persons with disabilities; 7. Also stresses that States, as provided for by the relevant international legal instruments, should prohibit forced and compulsory labour and punish perpetrators for its use in all its forms; 8. Emphasizes that the right to work entails, inter alia, the right not to be deprived of work arbitrarily and unfairly, and that States, in accordance with the relevant obligations in relation to the right to work, are required to put in place appropriate measures ensuring the protection of workers against unlawful dismissal; 9. Underscores the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of all human rights, including the right to work, and that equal access to work is pivotal to the full enjoyment of all human rights by women, while recognizing that women are on many occasions subject to discrimination in the context of realizing their rights in that regard on an equal basis with men and are disproportionately exposed to the most precarious working conditions, including work in the informal economy, limited or no legal protection, lower levels of representation in leadership and decision-making positions, lower levels of remuneration and involuntary temporary and part-time employment, and are disproportionately burdened with unpaid care and domestic work within the household and the family, which may constitute on many occasions a barrier to women’s greater involvement in the labour market; 10. Recognizes that progress has been made, yet is deeply concerned that many persons with disabilities continue to face multiple and intersecting forms of inequality and discrimination, including the lack of reasonable accommodation, which represent significant obstacles in exercising their right to work on an equal basis with others, and that they are frequently subject to less favourable conditions of pay, precarious, often informal working conditions and poor career prospects in a context of environmental, social and economic barriers in their access to work and within work, and in education and training, which results on many occasions in neglect of their potential and restrictions on opportunities to earn a living through their capabilities; 11. Underscores the responsibility of the State to protect children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with their education or to be harmful to their health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, and to take additional measures to prevent the engagement of children in the worst form of child labour; 12. Expresses concern that, according to the report of the International Labour Organization World Employment Social Outlook: Trends 2018, many countries continue to report high rates of labour underutilization, with large shares of discouraged workers and growing incidence of involuntary part-time employment, affecting in large part young people; 13. Notes with concern that, according to the report of the International Labour Organization Global Employment Trends for Youth 2017, although there has been a modest economic recovery, youth unemployment remains high and employment quality a concern, and young people are three times as likely as adults to be unemployed, which constitutes a serious global problem; 14. Expresses deep concern that inequalities are widening and there are not enough jobs, including quality jobs, and emphasizes that full and productive employment and decent work for young people play an important role in their empowerment and can contribute to, inter alia, the prevention of extremism, terrorism and social, economic and political instability, thus contributing to sustainable development and peace; A/HRC/37/L.28 15. Stresses that the fundamental importance of equal opportunities, education, technical and vocational training, and lifelong learning opportunities and guidance for all, including for women, young people and persons with disabilities, are necessary for the realization of the right to work; 16.

Calls for the universal ratification and effective implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and urges those States parties that have not yet done so to consider making the declaration under its article 14, thus providing the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination with the competence to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals within their jurisdiction claiming to be victims of a violation by a State party of any of the rights set forth in the Convention; NM A/73/312. 3/10 6.

Expresses deep concern about increased frequency of attempts and activities intended to desecrate or demolish monuments erected in remembrance of those who fought against Nazism during the Second World War, as well as to unlawfully exhume or remove the remains of such persons, and in this regard urges States to fully comply with their relevant obligations, inter alia, under article 34 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949; 13. Firmly condemns incidents that glorify and promote Nazism, such as incidents involving pro-Nazi graffiti and paintings, including on monuments dedicated to victims of the Second World War; 14. Underlines that neo-Nazism is more than just the glorification of a past movement, it is a contemporary phenomenon with strong vested interests in racial inequality and an investment in gaining broad support for its false claims of racial superiority; 15. Notes with concern that the largely unregulated, decentralized, cheap and anonymous nature of the Internet has allowed neo-Nazi groups to amplify their hate- filled messages and recruit new members across borders; 16.

Encourages States to take concrete measures, including legislative and educational ones, in order to prevent revisionism in respect of the Second World War and the denial of the crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during the Second World War; 19. Supports the finding of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance that education that seeks to undercut the racist effects of nationalist populism should include accurate and representative accounts of national history that give voice to racial and ethnic diversity and that expose the untruths of those who attempt to write minorities out of national histories and identities in order to sustain ethno-nationalist myths of racially or ethnically “pure” nations; 20. Condemns without reservation any denial of or attempt to deny the Holocaust, as well as any manifestation of religious intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence against persons or communities on the basis of ethnic origin or religious belief; 21. Welcomes the call of the Special Rapporteur for the active preservation of those Holocaust sites that served as Nazi death camps, concentration and forced labour camps and prisons, as well as his encouragement to States to take measures, including legislative, law enforcement and educational measures, to put an end to all forms of Holocaust denial; '* 22. Emphasizes the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur that revisions of the Holocaust and attempts to falsify history not only contribute to the rehabilitation and dissemination of Nazism and other extreme ideologies but also create fertile ground for nationalist and neo-Nazi demonstrations; 23. Underlines that revisionism and attempts to falsify history may fall under the prohibition of hate speech under article 4 (a) of the Convention, whereby States are required to declare as offences punishable by law; 24. Calls upon States to continue to take adequate steps, including through national legislation, in accordance with international human rights law, aimed at the prevention of hate speech and incitement to violence against persons in vulnerable situations and, where necessary, to consider reviewing national anti-racism legislation in the light of the increasingly open expression of hate speech and incitement to violence against such persons; 25. Expresses deep concern at the increase in the presence of groups and individuals espousing ideologies of hatred on the Internet, which, owing to its anonymity and relatively easy transnational accessibility, has aided in the shift of extremist ideology closer to the mainstream by allowing the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, organize meetings and violent protests, fundraise and engage in other activities that would be more difficult without the use of such technologies; 5/10 26. Also expresses deep concern about attempts at commercial advertising aimed at exploiting the sufferings of the victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War by the Nazi regime; 27. Seriously concerned by the fact that neo-Nazi groups have increasingly targeted susceptible individuals, mainly children and youth, by means of specifically tailored websites with the aim of their indoctrination by appealing to them through music, activities, games, “memes” and cartoon characters, as well as the online dissemination of revisionist historical educational lessons; 28. Stresses that the practices described above do injustice to the memory of the countless victims of crimes against humanity committed in the Second World War, in particular those committed by the SS organization and by those who fought against the anti-Hitler coalition and collaborated with the Nazi movement, and may negatively influence children and young people, and that failure by States to effectively address such practices is incompatible with the obligations of States Members of the United Nations under its Charter, including those related to the purposes and principles of the Organization; 29. Also stresses that all such practices fuel contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the spread and multiplication of various extremist political parties, movements and groups, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups, and in this regard calls for increased vigilance; 30. Expresses concern that the human rights and democratic challenges posed by extremist political parties, movements and groups are universal and no country is immune to them; 31. Emphasizes the need to take the measures necessary to put an end to the practices described above, and calls upon States and all other stakeholders to take more effective measures in accordance with international human rights law to prevent and combat those phenomena and extremist movements, which pose a real threat to democratic values, and to increase their vigilance and be proactive in strengthening their efforts to recognize and effectively address those challenges; 32. Underlines the importance of data and statistics on racist and xenophobic crimes for identifying the types of offences committed, the profiles of victims and of perpetrators and whether the latter are affiliated with extremist movements or groups, thus enhancing better understanding of the phenomenon and identifying effective measures to address such racist and xenophobic crimes, and recalls in this regard the commitments made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development! on data, monitoring and accountability, including collecting disaggregated data; 33. Encourages States to adopt further measures to provide training for the police and other law enforcement bodies on the ideologies of extremist political parties, movements and groups whose advocacy constitutes incitement to racist and xenophobic violence, to strengthen their capacity to address racist and xenophobic crimes, to fulfil their responsibility for bringing to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and to combat impunity; 34. Expresses deep concern about the increased number of seats occupied by representatives of extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character in a number of national and local parliaments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for all democratic political parties to base their programmes and activities on respect for human rights and freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and to condemn all messages disseminating ideas that are based on racial superiority or 'S Resolution 70/1. 6/10 hatred and that have the objective of fuelling contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 35. Shares the concern of the Special Rapporteur regarding the resurgence of neo-Nazism in contemporary times and growing support for and acceptance of neo-Nazism and related ideology in an increasing number of countries, especially through the use of new digital technologies; 36. Alarmed at the trend in some countries where expressions of Nazism and fascism are not prohibited, and neo-Nazi parties have emerged and contested electoral processes; 37. Notes with appreciation, in this regard, the call of the Special Rapporteur upon political leaders and parties to strongly condemn incitement to racial discrimination or xenophobia, to promote tolerance and respect and to refrain from forming coalitions with extremist parties of a racist or xenophobic character; !® 38. Welcomes the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to withdraw support — financial and otherwise — from political parties and other organizations that engage in neo-Nazi or other hate speech or fail forcefully to condemn such speech by their members, and to take steps to dismantle responsible organizations where such hate speech aims, or can reasonably be expected to incite violence; 39. Expresses concern that ethnic profiling and police violence against persons in vulnerable situations discourage victims from seeking redress owing to distrust of the legal system, and in this regard encourages States to improve diversity within law enforcement agencies and to impose appropriate sanctions against those within the public service found guilty of racially motivated violence or of using hate speech; 40.

the recommendations contained in the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,’ as well as the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, adopted in Rome on 21 November 2014,° Acknowledging that the right to food has been recognized as the right of every individual, alone or in community with others, to have physical and economic access at all times to sufficient, adequate, nutritious food, in conformity with, inter alia, the culture, beliefs, traditions, dietary habits and preferences of individuals, that is produced and consumed sustainably, thereby preserving access to food for future generations, Reaffirming the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security, adopted in Rome on 16

footing and with the same emphasis, Reaffirming also that a peaceful, stable and enabling political, social and economic environment, at both the national and the international levels, is the essential foundation that will enable States to give adequate priority to food and nutrition security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security, the Declaration of the World Food Summit and the Rome Declaration on Nutrition, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter and that endanger food and nutrition security, Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations ° See Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document WSFS 2009/2. 2/11 contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action, as well as in the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food and nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and that these problems are increasing dramatically in some regions in the absence of urgent, determined and concerted action, Recognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting and storage for indigenous peoples and others living in rural areas, Recognizing further the complex character of food insecurity and its likely recurrence owing to a combination of several major factors, such as the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, the least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the volatility of commodity prices are among the factors causing or exacerbating famine and severe food insecurity and that additional efforts, including international support, to respond, prevent and prepare for increasing global food insecurity are urgently needed, Stressing the obligation of all States and parties to an armed conflict to protect civilians, in accordance with international humanitarian law, and calling upon Member States, the United Nations and other relevant organizations to take further steps to provide a coordinated emergency response to the food and nutrition needs of affected populations, while aiming to ensure that such steps are supportive of national strategies and programmes aimed at improving food security and nutrition, Reaffirming that starvation of civilians as a method of combat is prohibited under international humanitarian law and that it is therefore prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless, for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, Resolved to act to ensure that the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and the human rights perspective are taken into account at the national, regional and international levels in measures to address the realization of the right to food, Stressing the possible benefits of international trade to improve food and nutrition availability, 3/11 Stressing also that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, through, inter alia, the promotion of investments in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts and tackle water scarcity, as well as in programmes, practices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Concerned that the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are harming agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus contributing to food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to increase with future climate change, Expressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the enjoyment of the right to food, Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and nutrition security and the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security!° by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in

documents, the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, Stressing also the need to increase official development assistance devoted to agriculture and nutrition, Recognizing that small and medium-sized farmers in developing countries need to receive technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support, Recognizing also the importance of the protection and preservation of agrobiodiversity in guaranteeing food security and nutrition and the right to food for all, Noting the cultural values of dietary and eating habits in different cultures, and recognizing that food plays an important role in defining the identity of individuals and communities and is a cultural component that describes and gives value to a territory and its inhabitants, 10 Food and Agriculture

Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects created by the world food crisis still continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of the crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially the least developed countries; 5. Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018, the number of hungry people in the world is unacceptably high, the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries and the number of undernourished people in the world has been on the rise since 2016, reaching an estimated 821 million in 2017; 6. Also expresses its deep concern that, while women contribute more than 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they also account for 70 per cent of the world’s hungry, that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to mainstream a gender perspective in food security programmes and to take action to address de jure and de facto gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular when they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8.

Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 17. Also recognizes that 70 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, where nearly half a billion family farmers are located, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access for their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 18. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation 3 A/HRC/27/31; see also Human Rights Council resolution 33/11 (see Official Records of the General Assembly, Seventy-first Session, Supplement No. 53A and corrigendum (A/71/53/Add.1 and A/71/53/Add.1/Corr.1), chap.
