Expresses its concern that new recruitments have not been used to correct the imbalance in favour of one region and that more than half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from this same region, which accounts for more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined; 5. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (200 series staff) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100 series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series staff rules, a practice against established policies that should be discontinued; 6. Reaffirms that Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations should guide the Secretary-General in his policy for recruiting the staff of the Organization, mindful of the criteria of equitable geographical distribution; 7.

Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries, including to key posts; 10. Requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts and to the recruitment of women,; 11. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that, consistent with General Assembly resolution 50/11 of 2 November 1995, upon recruitment, personnel recruited have a command of and use at least one of the working languages of the Secretariat and that the use of another of the six official languages is duly encouraged and taken into account, particularly when promotion and incremental steps are under consideration, in order to ensure linguistic balance within the organization; 12. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 13. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 14.

Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of his mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 18. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 19. Reiterates its request to the High Commissioner to use the policy of new recruitments to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of his Office; 20. Also requests the High Commissioner to submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixtieth session, which should include: 18. 19. 20.
