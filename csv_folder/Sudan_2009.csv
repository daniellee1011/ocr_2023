Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;® 2. | Emphasizes the special importance of a timely, effective, comprehensive and durable and development-oriented solution to the debt problems of developing countries; 3. Recognizes that the enormity and the multidimensional nature of the global economic and financial crisis and the significant risks it poses to the debt sustainability of developing and transition economies, and emphasizes the need for coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief and debt restructuring with the provision of additional resources to developing countries and countries with economies in transition without conditionalities, since the balance between debt financing, temporary standstills, restructuring and relief can contribute to economic growth and development; 4. Also notes that the additional fiscal pressure placed on low- and middle- income developing countries that are not included in existing debt relief initiatives imposes constraints on their capacity to mobilize the resources needed to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals; 5. Stresses the need to assist developing countries to respond to the crisis without requiring them to incur unsustainable levels of debt and without increasing the risk of relapsing into another debt crisis, calls for the provision of concessional and grant-based financing to developing countries to respond to the crisis, and encourages developed countries to allocate new and additional resources to assist developing countries in coping with the consequences of the crisis; 6. Notes the International Monetary Fund’s provision of interest relief to low-income countries in the form of zero payments for concessional lending facilities until the end of 2011, and further calls for a temporary debt moratorium on official debt of low-income countries until 2011 to provide them with much needed fiscal space to respond to the crisis; 7.

Calls for an urgent review of the joint International Monetary Fund/ World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework, in order to enhance its transparency and objectivity, and expresses concern that developing countries were not consulted in the recent review of the joint International Monetary Fund/World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework, and, in this regard, calls for the full engagement of developing countries in an open and transparent manner in future reviews; 10.

Reiterates that debt sustainability depends on a confluence of many factors at the international and national levels, emphasizes that country-specific circumstances and the impact of external shocks should continue to be taken into account in debt sustainability analyses, underscores the fact that no single indicator should be used to make definitive judgements about debt sustainability, and, in this regard, while acknowledging the need to use transparent and comparable indicators, invites the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, in their assessment of debt sustainability, to take into account fundamental changes caused by, inter alia, natural disasters, conflicts and changes in global growth prospects or in the terms of trade, especially for commodity-dependent developing countries, as well as by the impact of developments in financial markets and weaknesses in the international monetary and financial system, and to continue to provide information on this issue using existing cooperation forums, including those involving Member States; 13. Underlines the facts that the long-term sustainability of debt depends, inter alia, on the economic growth, mobilization of domestic resources and export prospects of debtor countries and, hence, on the creation of an enabling international environment conducive to development, progress in following sound macroeconomic policies, transparent and effective regulatory frameworks and success in overcoming structural development problems, that systemic issues impact on development in countries and reverse gains, and that subsequent reform of the international financial system must be conducive to fostering an inclusive financial and monetary system; 14.

Urges donors to ensure that their commitments to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are additional to A/C.2/64/L.9 existing official development assistance commitments, and underlines that full compensation by donors on the basis of fair burden-sharing for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative costs of relevant financial institutions is essential; 16.

Stresses the need to significantly address the debt problems of middle- income developing countries, and in this regard stresses the importance of the Evian approach of the Paris Club as a practical means to address this issue, and notes that the current debt sustainability framework used to analyse the debt situation of middle-income countries focuses mostly on medium-term debt dynamics; 21. Notes the changing composition of sovereign debt that has shifted increasingly from external public debt to domestic debt to pay off foreign currency liabilities, notes that the levels of domestic debt could create other challenges for macroeconomic management and public debt sustainability, emphasizes the importance of safe structures of debt, and calls for reinforcing the capacity to manage the new levels of domestic debt in order to maintain public debt sustainability overall; 22. Notes that financial reform policies and the deepening of financial markets have enhanced the access of private borrowers to international capital markets, also notes that the share of total external long-term debt owed by private borrowers increased substantially in recent years, constituting half of private borrowing, further notes that corporate debt makes up the majority of short-term external debt of developing countries, and calls for the necessary policy space in developing countries in addressing corporate insolvencies arising from the economic and financial crisis; 23.

Calls upon the international community to provide prompt assistance and flexibility, and stresses the need to continue those efforts in helping post-conflict developing countries, especially those that are heavily indebted and poor, to achieve initial reconstruction for economic and social development; 31. Calls upon creditors to provide flexibility to developing countries affected by natural disasters so as to allow them to address their debt problems; 32.

Notes with grave concern that the International Monetary Fund is still prescribing pro-cyclical policies in developing countries which can unnecessarily exacerbate economic downturns, underscores that such policies are in violation of the international consensus to undertake a concerted effort to stimulate global demand, emphasizes that conditionalities still require Members States to pursue pro-cyclical policies or adopt monetary and regulatory policies that exacerbate the impacts of the current crisis, thus placing developing countries at a disadvantage relative to developed countries, and are a disincentive for developing countries to seek support funding, and in this regard, calls on the Bretton Woods institutions to refrain from imposing pro-cyclical polices and conditionalities; 11.

Encourages, at the regional level, as appropriate, the establishment and wider use of regional units of account, currency swap agreements and settlement through clearing unions as a possible partial cushion against international currency volatility; A/C.2/64/L.19 21.

Also recognizes the negative impacts of excessive short-term capital flows and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the role of capital control measures in mitigating the negative impact of those flows, while taking into account the sovereign rights of States; 24.

Invites the international financial and banking institutions to enhance the transparency of risk-rating mechanisms, noting that sovereign risk assessments made by the private sector should maximize the use of strict, objective and transparent parameters, which can be facilitated by high-quality data and analysis, and encourages relevant development institutions, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to continue their work on this issue, including its potential impact on the development prospects of developing countries; 26.

Stresses the need to continuously improve standards of corporate and public sector governance, including accounting, auditing and measures to ensure transparency; 29.
