A/C.3/67/L.42/Rev.1 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 do so from hunger-related illness, that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are chronically undernourished is about 870 million worldwide, and that an additional 1 billion people are suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries; 5. | Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012,1° the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high, and 98 per cent of undernourished people in the world live in developing countries; 6. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 8. | Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 9.

Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security, and the contribution of small- scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; !4 14. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 15. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; !2 16.

Requests all States and private actors, as well as_ international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 20. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 21. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 22. Calls for the early conclusion and a successful, development-oriented outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution to creating international conditions that permit the full realization of the right to food; 23. Stresses that all States should make all efforts to ensure that their international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 24. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 25. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in this regard, and once again invites all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security’ and the United Nations Millennium Declaration;* 26. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; A/C.3/67/L.42/Rev.1 27. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 28. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 29. Also stresses that States parties to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights!® should consider implementing that agreement in a manner that is supportive of food security, while being mindful of the obligation of Member States to promote and protect the right to food; 30.

developmental potential and to participate in society, Recognizing the important contribution that non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors can make in promoting human rights for persons with disabilities, including all individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), developmental disorders (DD) and associated disabilities, and their integration in societies, as well as addressing the socioeconomic needs of their families and communities, Reaffirming the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, Affirming that ensuring and promoting the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, without distinction, is critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, Recalling its resolution 66/124 of 19 December 2011, by which it decided to convene a one-day high-level meeting of the General Assembly, on 23 September 2013, with the overarching theme “The way forward: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond”, which shall be funded within existing resources, in order to strengthen efforts to ensure accessibility for and the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development efforts, Aware that autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects the functioning of the brain, characterized by impairments in social interaction, problems with verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests and activities, Aware also that the vast variety of needs of individuals with ASD, DD and associated disabilities poses a substantial challenge to addressing the disability and providing the appropriate services for treatment and care by Government and non-governmental organizations, Deeply concerned that children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities in all regions of the world experience challenges in accessing long-term health care, education, training and intervention programmes undertaken by Governments, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, Concerned also that those persons with ASD, DD and associated disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society, and reaffirming that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person, Recalling that early diagnosis, appropriate research and effective interventions are vital to the growth and development of the individual, and emphasizing that early intervention is crucial for addressing the needs of the individual with ASD, DD and associated disabilities, thus improving the opportunities to live a quality life A/67/L.33 with the ability to participate in the greater community and increasing the likelihood that an individual will need lower levels of support later in life, Recognizing that the full enjoyment by persons with ASD, DD and associated disabilities of their human rights and their full participation will result in significant advances in the social and economic development of societies and communities, Realizing that the challenge of meeting the needs of individuals with ASD, DD and associated disabilities is particularly acute in the developing world, resulting in increased difficulties for individuals and their families, as well as for the health, education and social welfare systems trying to meet their needs, Further recognizing the work of the World Health Organization in addressing ASD, DD and associated disabilities in its resolutions, notably through resolution 65.4 entitled “The global burden of mental disorders and the need for a comprehensive, coordinated response from health and social sectors at the country level”, adopted by the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly, requesting the Director General of the World Health Organization to develop a comprehensive mental health action plan, for consideration by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly, ® Recognizing that a major barrier to improving the health and well-being of children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities and their families is the paucity of knowledge and expertise to recognize symptoms and identify ASD, and also recognizing that the absence of effective routine screening that allows for early detection, in turn, limits access to care and early interventions and that, without research to develop and implement effective programmes, the emergence of appropriate solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families does not occur, Acknowledging efforts to increase awareness of the rights of those affected by ASD, DD and associated disabilities, including the commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day, which led to increased international public concern for autism and other developmental disabilities, Taking note of the Dhaka Declaration on Autism Spectrum Disorders and Developmental Disabilities of 25 July
