It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace"", Aware that the lofty aims stated in the aforementioned provision are reflected in the majority of the international conventions promoting and protecting economic, social and cultural rights, such as article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and that article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that education shall be directed to the development of the child’s personality and of respect for human rights and cultural identity, and the preparation of the child for responsible life in a free society, Taking into account the fact that the international community, inspired by these principles and realizing the urgent need to promote education, has established international and regional bodies for this purpose, such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund, Considering that illiteracy and restricted access to all-round education is one of mankind’s main problems and that this impinges on the development process of our peoples, Considering further that significant efforts are being made by States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to develop human rights education programmes, Bearing in mind that these human rights education programmes have served to create a keen awareness, in the various regions of the world, of the priority nature of the educational process and its importance for the promotion, dissemination and knowledge of human rights, Taking into account the fact that human rights education is a world priority in that it contributes to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of the human being, which must include consideration of the diversity of groups such as children, women, indigenous persons, racial minorities, the disabled and others, Bearing in mind that knowledge of fundamental rights and mechanisms for their protection will enable democratic processes to be strengthened and consolidated, Aware that human rights education involves more than just providing information to the recipients and, rather, constitutes a comprehensive process hinging essentially on respect for the human person, human dignity and the fostering of attitudes conducive to co-existence, justice and peace, 1.

Decides to consider the question of the implementation of the Programme of Action every two years in order to evaluate the progress made in eliminating the exploitation of child labour. ANNEX PROGRAMME OF ACTION FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE EXPLOITATION OF CHILD LABOUR General 1. In spite of the progress made in combating the exploitation of child labour, in particular through the development of national and international norms which have defined the bases of legal protection, and of mechanisms for monitoring their application, the exploitation of child labour still remains a current and widespread phenomenon of a serious nature in various parts of the world. 2. This phenomenon, which is both complex and worldwide, varies from one country to another. Although the industrialized countries are not spared, it affects the developing countries more particularly, and within each country the more vulnerable groups of the population. Poverty is often the main cause of child labour, but generations of children should not be condemned, until poverty is overcome, to exploitation. Underdevelopment cannot justify exploitation of which children are the victims. The Governments concerned and the international community as a whole must not wait for development problems to be adequately solved before attacking the phenomenon of the exploitation of child labour. Besides the long-term action which should be initiated with a view to treating the deep causes underlying the exploitation of child labour, it is essential that urgent measures and medium- and short-term action be taken to meet the immediate needs of the children who are exposed to the gravest dangers, while making sure that such action is integrated into economic and social development strategies. 3. High priority should be given to the elimination of the most odious or degrading forms of child exploitation, in particular child prostitution, pornography, the sale of children, the employment of children in dangerous occupations or for enforced begging and debt bondage. 4. The international community should place particular emphasis on the new phenomena of the exploitation of child labour, such as the use of children for illegal, clandestine or criminal purposes, including their implication in the narcotic drugs traffic or in armed conflicts or military activities. 5. Action should be directed, first, towards the most dangerous forms of child labour and the elimination of work by children under 10 years of age, with a view to the total elimination of child labour as prohibited by the provisions of the relevant international instruments. 6. Special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable categories of children: children of immigrants, street children, children of minority groups, indigenous children, refugee children, children in occupied territories and those under the apartheid regime. 7. In order to reach the core of one of the prime causes of exploitation of child labour, which is poverty, increased resources should be made available through bilateral and multilateral channels for the elimination of the exploitation of child labour. Elimination of the phenomena linked with the exploitation of child labour calls for social measures and development assistance. Their prevention will require deep structural reforms in the economic, social and cultural spheres. 8. Particular attention should also be given to social rehabilitation, education and information. It is important that the means of protecting children should be strengthened by development, the reinforcement of legislation and proper application of the relevant laws. 9. Adequate means and concerted measures are necessary at the local, national, regional and international levels. Information 10. The public could be made aware of the problem and the different aspects of the exploitation of child labour by national and international information campaigns. The extent of the problem cannot be accurately defined by reference to the statistics from various sources. The sectors favouring the exploitation of child labour should be specially targeted (agriculture, non- structured urban sector and domestic service). It is important to reach the children who are the invisible victims of parallel employment networks. At the national level it is necessary to develop means of investigation and supervision by labour inspectors in order to detect and prosecute cases of exploitation of child labour, so as to break up the clandestine employment networks. Public and private institutions and agencies dealing with children who have been victims of labour exploitation should be encouraged to keep appropriate statistical information for scientific purposes, while respecting anonymity and confidentiality. The information campaign should also be able to reach children directly, in order to inform them of their rights and make them aware of the risks they run. Education and vocational training 11. There is undoubtedly a link between child labour, illiteracy, school failure and the lack of vocational training. Education is one of the most effective measures to prevent child labour. Massive literacy programmes, combined with legislation making basic training obligatory and free, as well as measures to combat school wastage and to develop vocational training, in the form, for example, of a system of apprenticeship, are extremely necessary. Such programmes could be supported by community campaigns to increase the awareness and motivation of families, and in particular of women. Social action 12. The economic and social causes of the persistence of child labour, including the fact that it is seen in many cases as a means of survival for the children and their families, should be taken up in order to offer an alternative that will take the children out of the circle of poverty and exploitation. Urgent measures could be taken on behalf of children who are subjected to high physical and moral risks. It is important to give them protection and assistance, including social and medical assistance, while at the same time pursuing the objective of the elimination of child labour. These urgent measures should be backed up by programmes of social rehabilitation. Development aid 13. For many countries, the implementation of local, regional and national programmes on behalf of children requires appropriate international aid and a deeper commitment by the international community, whether through specific projects or through development assistance. Labour standards and their application 14. States should adhere to the international standards in force and ensure that they are rigorously applied. It is important that, in accordance with article 1 of International Labour Organisation Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138), States should undertake ""to pursue a national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of child labour and to raise progressively the minimum age for admission to employment or work to a level consistent with the fullest physical and mental development of young persons"". National legislation should explicitly prohibit dangerous or high-risk employment and prescribe penalties for employers who break this law, as well as providing for the establishment of an effective labour inspection system. In at least three cases the exploitation of child labour is no less than a flagrant crime which violates the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the most elementary principles of morality and all positive laws. Energetic repressive action is called for in these cases, namely: (a) Sale and similar practices (serfdom, bond service, fake adoption, abandonment) ; (b) Child prostitution, trafficking in pornography involving the sexuality of children, and international traffic in girls and boys for immoral purposes; (c) Under-age maidservants in a position of servitude. Duties of States 15. States should fully apply the provisions of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 1386 (XIV) of 20 November 1959 and, more particularly: (a) Principle 2, according to which ""The child shall enjoy special protection, and shall be given opportunities and facilities, by law and by other means, to enable him to develop physically, mentally, morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and normal manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity ...;"" (b) Principle 9, according to which ""The child shall be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation. He shall not be the subject of traffic, in any form ..."". 16. States should consider the possibility of ratifying, as soon as possible, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 44/25 of 20 November 1989, and in this context should fully implement, in particular, article 32, which reads as follows: ""1. States Parties recognize the rights of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. ""2. States Parties shall take legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to ensure the implementation of the present article. To this end, and having regard to the relevant provisions of other international instruments, States Parties shall in particular: (a) Provide for a minimum age or minimum ages for admission to employment; (b) Provide for appropriate regulation of the hours and conditions of employment; (c) Provide for appropriate penalties or other sanctions to ensure the effective enforcement of the present article."" 17. Over 40 countries have ratified International Labour Organisation Convention No. 138. Those that have not done so should take appropriate steps to ratify this Convention. In this connection, greater assistance from the International Labour Organisation should be extended to the developing countries to facilitate their increased participation in standard-setting activities and in the implementation of ratified conventions. 18. States should adopt and implement policies and programmes to narrow the gap between legislation and its implementation in practice. 19. States should, until such time that child labour is eliminated, pay specific attention to the issue of protection of working children and make recommendations on ways and means to ensure that their working conditions are kept under scrutiny and control. 20. States which have not already done so should review their legislation in the field of child labour with a view to the absolute prohibition of employment of children in the following cases: (a) Employment before the normal age of completion of primary schooling in the country concerned; (b) Under-age maid service; (c) Night work; (d) Work in dangerous or unhealthy conditions; (e) Activities linked with prostitution, pornography and other forms of sexual trade and exploitation; (f£) Work concerned with trafficking in and production of illicit drugs; (g) Work involving degrading or cruel treatment. 21. States should take preventive and curative measures, including the strengthening of their legislation, to combat the phenomena of the exploitation of child labour, such as the use of children for illegal, clandestine or criminal purposes, including the traffic in narcotic drugs, or in armed conflicts or military activities, or any other form of conflict. 22. Member States should be encouraged to strengthen cooperation between police and all public and private organizations which deal with cases of exploitation of child labour either within or outside the family, to facilitate identification of cases of exploitation of child labour and to take measures necessary to eliminate it. 23. States should, where necessary, undertake development programmes with a view to: (a) Making primary education compulsory and available free to all; (b) Assisting and encouraging families in order that their children may continue their education, in order to combat illiteracy and the phenomenon of school drop-outs; and, until such time that primary education is compulsory and available free to all, developing school programmes, including part-time education programmes, adapted to the needs of children who are not in school; (c) Adapting school curricula to the preparation of a child fora 21. career; (d) Improving the training programmes of professional workers dealing with child labour, in particular labour inspectors, social workers and magistrates, with a view, in particular, to making them more sensitive to the needs of children; (e) Establishing or improving medical services for children. 24. States should ensure the availability of a sufficient number of work inspectors and train them systematically to deal with cases of exploitation of child labour. Particular attention should be given to national and regional plans for economic and social development for the occupational training of young people. National development plans should also include a section devoted particularly to the employment of young people and to methods of ensuring that the most deprived have sufficient resources to be able to protect themselves from conditions leading to exploitation. 25. All Member States should endeavour to establish national agencies or institutions to promote the rights of children and to protect them from any form of exploitation. Particular efforts should be made to stress the importance of family values. Role of United Nations bodies and specialized agencies 26. The International Labour Organisation should be encouraged in its activities within the framework of its work programme relating to child labour. Other specialized agencies and United Nations bodies, in particular WHO, UNESCO and UNICEF, should develop and/or reinforce their activities in the field of child labour. 27. All competent United Nations agencies, development banks and intergovernmental bodies involved in development projects should ensure that no child is employed either directly or through local subcontractors. 28. The United Nations and the specialized agencies, having regard to their special responsibilities in the field of child labour, should pay special attention to the situation of children in South Africa and in the occupied Arab territories. 29. While the question of exploitation of child labour should primarily be dealt with by the International Labour Organisation, the United Nations human rights bodies should continue to be concerned with this question in the framework of the rights of the child in general. The Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities and its Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery should continue to have responsibility in this field. 30. The United Nations and the specialized agencies, including the United Nations University, should continue to incorporate in their programmes a series of interdisciplinary and multinational projects for comparative research on the various aspects of the exploitation of child labour throughout the world and in particular in the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. 31. The United Nations and the specialized agencies should reinforce their programmes related to the elimination of the exploitation of child labour, and in particular to the study of the economic, social, legal and cultural factors which give rise to it. 32. The Secretary-General should invite all United Nations agencies and specialized agencies to attach greater importance to eliminating the exploitation of child labour and to study and discuss this issue at forthcoming international conferences, with special emphasis being placed on it at major conferences. 33. An international child welfare fund should be established. The resources of the fund would be allocated to combat violations of the rights provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly the rights of those children living in especially difficult circumstances, such as orphans and street children, refugees or displaced persons, victims of war and of natural and man-made disasters, including such perils as exposure to radiation and dangerous chemicals, children of migrant workers and other socially disadvantaged groups, child workers or youth trapped in the bondage of prostitution, sexual abuse and other forms of exploitation, disabled children and juvenile delinquents and victims of apartheid and foreign occupation. Such children deserve special attention, protection and assistance from their families and communities and as part of national efforts and international cooperation. Cooperation at the local, national and international levels 34. Major steps should be taken by Governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations to increase awareness amongst children, parents, workers, trade unions and employers of the causes and the adverse effects of child labour and measures to combat its exploitation. Such steps could include wider dissemination of relevant international instruments translated, where appropriate, into languages other than the official languages of the United Nations, as well as development and strengthening of existing norms. 35. Support should be given to non-governmental organizations concerned with the problem of child labour, particularly at the community level, and a constructive partnership should be evolved between Governments and non- governmental organizations. 36. The United Nations bodies and the specialized agencies dealing with the problem of child labour should seek the cooperation of national and international trade unions. 37. Appropriate and necessary forms of support should be given to non-governmental organizations at all levels, especially community organizations, concerned with the problem of child labour. 38. Concerned United Nations bodies and specialized agencies should examine the possibility of promoting an information campaign among villagers, employers, parents, children and other groups in countries where child labour exists. 39. Members of the international community should cooperate in order to assist developing countries in creating conditions under which child labour could be entirely eliminated. 37.",03/08/1993,1993_160531,Uruguay,"* In accordance with rule 69, paragraph 3, of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council.",no

ANNEX I Further measures for the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields I. INTRODUCTION 1. The United Nations has a unique and paramount role in the promotion of international cooperation for development. In the present historical context, the end of the cold war, the increasing interdependence of nations, the increasing globalization of the world economy, and the growing linkages between economic, social and related issues, the need for an enhanced role for the United Nations in international cooperation for development has multiplied manifold. This, on one hand, entails strengthening the role of the United Nations in promoting international economic cooperation for development as envisaged in the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and, on the other, restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields. 2. The United Nations has established goals, targets and programmes for action in the economic, social and related fields. Important milestones of global consensus to promote international economic cooperation include, the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation, in particular the Revitalization of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries, 1/ adopted at the eighteenth special session of the General Assembly, held from 23 April to 1 May 1990, the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, 2/ the final documents adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at its eighth session, held at Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, from 8 to 25 February 1992, in particular the Declaration and the document entitled ""A New Partnership for Development: the Cartagena Commitment"", 3/ the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, 4/ and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s, 5/ adopted at the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris from 3 to 14 September 1990. The various Resolution S-18/3, annex, of 1 May 1990. Resolution 45/199, annex, of 21 December 1990. TD/364, part one, sect. A. Resolution 46/151, annex, sect. II, of 18 December 1991. See A/CONF.147/18. conventions and consensus agreements, especially Agenda 21, 6/ which were adopted at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at the level of heads of State and Government, mark the beginning of a new global partnership for sustainable development. All these landmarks together provide the overall framework of international cooperation for development. 3. Each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development, in accordance with its specific situation and conditions. Reactivation of economic growth and development in all countries requires concerted efforts by the international community. In this context, particular attention should be given to the growth and development needs of developing countries. Concerns of countries with economies in transition should also be addressed. The policies and actions of the major industrialized countries profoundly influence world economic growth and the international economic environment. They should continue to make efforts to promote sustained and sustainable growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that should benefit other countries, particularly the developing countries. 4. The coordination of macroeconomic policies should take full account of the interests and concerns of all countries. In this context, efforts should be made to enhance the effectiveness of multilateral surveillance aimed at correcting external and fiscal imbalances, promoting non-inflationary sustained and sustainable growth, lowering real rates of interest and making exchange rates more stable and markets more accessible. 5. The United Nations is a unique forum where, based on the principle of sovereign equality of all States and the universality of its membership, the community of nations can address all issues in an integrated manner. The organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system have a vital role to play in furthering the analytical work of relevance to the implementation of global consensus on international economic cooperation, in promoting and securing the international cooperation needed and in providing technical assistance. The international development system should be given greater coherence by closer inter-agency cooperation and coordination and by organizational measures, including guidelines on reporting, that strengthen the contribution of the system to development. There is also an urgent need to discuss ways of enabling the specialized agencies, which make an indispensable contribution to development, to perform better their mandated functions on the basis of enhanced coordination guidance from the Council. Efforts should be made to promote greater coordination and cooperation among the various components of the United Nations system. 6. The United Nations has also a substantial programme of operational activities through which it provides technical and other assistance for development. There is a continuing need to improve the quality and impact of these activities of the United Nations. 6/ Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, 3-14 June 1991 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.1.8), vol. I, resolution I, annex II. II. PRINCIPLES FOR RESTRUCTURING AND REVITALIZATION 7. The basic principles and guidelines for restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields were established by the General Assembly in resolution 45/264 of 13 May 1991 and reaffirmed in resolution 46/235 of 13 April 1992. This effort should also take into account the thrust and principles of the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation, in particular the Revitalization of Economic Growth and Development of the Developing Countries, as contained in the annex to Assembly resolution S-18/3, and Assembly resolution 45/199 of 21 December 1990, and other relevant resolutions. The current reform and all future efforts at reform should respect and build upon those resolutions and should be in conformity with the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which is based upon the sovereign equality of all its Members. III. INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS A. Complementarity between the work of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies 8. The objective is to enhance the complementarity between the work of the Economic and Social Council and the work of the General Assembly, in accordance with Article 60 of the Charter, in order to avoid the present overlapping and unnecessary duplication of work, debates and items between these two organs and their subsidiary bodies. 9. Both principal organs should carry out their respective responsibilities, as entrusted to them in the Charter, in the formulation of policies and the provision of guidance to and coordination of United Nations activities in the economic, social and related fields. 10. In order to ensure that the operational activities of the United Nations system effectively assist the recipient countries in their development efforts, improvements are needed at both the policy-making and the operational levels. The role of the General Assembly 11. The General Assembly is the highest intergovernmental mechanism for the formulation and appraisal of policy on matters relating to the economic, social and related fields, in accordance with Chapter IX of the Charter. It is the main forum where Governments pursue the development dialogue, which includes all these issues, in its political context. The purpose of the dialogue is to take an integrated view of matters relating to the economic, social and related fields in order to build and deepen the political understanding required for enhanced international development cooperation, to generate impulses for action and to launch initiatives. The role of the Economic and Social Council 12. The functions and powers of the Economic and Social Council are provided for in Chapters IX and X of the Charter and as elaborated in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly. With the adoption and implementation of General Assembly resolutions 45/264 and 46/235, the Council has been significantly revitalized. The following additional measures will further strengthen the Council: (a) High-level segment 13. As established by the General Assembly in its resolution 45/264, the high-level segment of the Council’s substantive session shall continue to consider one or more major economic and/or social policy themes, with the participation of Ministers. It should also carry out a one-day policy dialogue and discussion with the heads of financial and trade institutions. In this connection, these institutions are invited to furnish relevant special reports and studies on the selected themes, within their respective mandates and areas of expertise, as well as on important developments in the world economy and in international economic cooperation, in accordance with the agreements signed between them and the United Nations. (b) Coordination segment 14. The coordination segment shall continue to deal with one or more themes selected at the organizational session of the Council, as established in Assembly resolution 45/264, and will take up coordination matters arising from subsidiary bodies, principal organs and specialized agencies in the economic, social and related fields. Following the coordination segment there should be agreed conclusions containing specific recommendations to the various parts of the United Nations system for their implementation, in accordance with resolution 45/264. In accordance with the present resolution and resolution 45/264, the Secretary-General should arrange to inform the Council at its following substantive session of steps taken by the United Nations system to give effect to these recommendations. (c) Operational activities of the United Nations for international development cooperation segment 15. In order to improve the quality and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations and to promote an integrated approach in this field, this segment shall provide coordination and guidance so as to ensure that the policies formulated by the Assembly, particularly during the triennial policy review of operational activities, are appropriately implemented on a system-wide basis. The work of the operational activities segment would include a high-level meeting, open to all Member States in accordance with Article 69 of the Charter, including ministerial participation, to provide an opportunity for policy makers to engage in broad consultations on international development cooperation. Specific arrangements will be decided upon by the Council at its organizational session. The outcome of this segment shall be reflected, inter alia, in the adoption of decisions and resolutions. 16. This segment will have the following functions: (a) To provide the United Nations system with cross-sectoral coordination and overall guidance on a system-wide basis, including objectives, priorities and strategies, in the implementation of the policies formulated by the General Assembly in the field of operational activities; (b) To monitor the division of labour between and cooperation within the bodies of the United Nations system, in particular the development funds and programmes, to include the conduct of field-level coordination, and make appropriate recommendations to the Assembly, as well as to provide guidance, where appropriate, to the system; (c) To review and evaluate the reports on the work of the development funds and programmes, including the assessment of their overall impact, with a view to enhancing the operational activities of the United Nations on a system-wide basis; (d) To undertake preparatory work for the triennial policy review of operational activities by the Assembly; (e) To review the operationally relevant recommendations of the subsidiary bodies of the Council and other relevant bodies in the light of policies established by the General Assembly, in order to incorporate them, as appropriate, into the operational activities of the United Nations; (£) To provide orientation and recommendations to the relevant inter-agency coordination mechanisms and to support and enhance their role. (d) General segment 17. The Economic and Social Committees of the Council shall be subsumed into the plenary as of 1994. Thus, the Council shall supervise the activities of its subsidiary bodies by considering and taking appropriate action on their reports and recommendations in the general segment. 18. The general segment shall be so organized as to recognize the distinction between economic and social issues as reflected in the agenda. In its consideration of the reports of its subsidiary bodies the Council shall concentrate on the conclusions and the adoption of recommendations and shall refrain from duplicating the substantive debate already held. However, further substantive discussions on specific issues shall be undertaken at the request of one or more Member States. 19. The various segments of the Council’s substantive session, particularly the operational activities segment, shall be organized in such a way as to ensure that there is adequate time available for proper discussion of any item on the agenda, including those currently dealt with by the Economic and Social Committees, on the basis of the practice of the Council. 20. Ministerial attendance is encouraged throughout sessions of the Council, particularly in the high-level and operational activities segments of its substantive session. 3. Governing bodies of the United Nations development funds and programmes 21. The current governing bodies of the United Nations Development Programme/the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Children’s Fund shall be transformed into Executive Boards which shall be responsible for supervising the activities of each fund or programme in accordance with the overall policy guidance of the Assembly and the Council, in accordance with their respective responsibility as set out in the Charter, and for ensuring that they are responsive to the needs and priorities of recipient countries. The Boards will be subject to the authority of the Council. The need for a separate Executive Board for the United Nations Population Fund shall be further considered in the light of the outcome of the International Conference on Population and Development to be held in 1994. 22. The functions of each Executive Board shall be the following: (a) To implement the policies formulated by the Assembly and the coordination and guidance received from the Council; (b) To receive information from and give guidance to the head of each fund or programme on the work of each organization; (c) To ensure that the activities and operational strategies of each fund or programme are consistent with the overall policy guidance set forth by the Assembly and the Council, in accordance with their respective responsibility as set out in the Charter; (d) To monitor the performance of the fund or programme; (e) To approve programmes, including country programmes, and projects with respect to the World Food Programme, as appropriate; (f) To decide on administrative and financial plans and budgets; (g) To recommend new initiatives to the Council and, through the Council, to the Assembly as necessary; (h) To encourage and examine new programme initiatives; (i) To submit annual reports to the Council at its substantive session, which could include recommendations, where appropriate, for improvement of field-level coordination. 23. Membership of each Executive Board shall be with due regard to geographical representation and other relevant factors, with a view the most effective and broadest participation. The number of seats Board shall take into account the need for the effective conduct of each Board. equitable to ensuring on each the work of 24. The Executive Boards of the United Nations Development Programme/the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Children’s Fund shall have 30 members each, as follows: 7 from African States, 6 from Asian States, 3 from Eastern European States, 4 from Latin America and Caribbean States and 10 from Western European and other States. 25. The Executive Boards shall meet regularly during the year with periodicity, agendas and other arrangements to be decided upon by each Board at its organizational session. Decision-making shall continue to be according to existing rules and the practice of striving for consensus should be encouraged. 26. In order to ensure an effective and efficient interaction between the Assembly, the Council and the individual Executive Boards, each Board will submit an annual report to the Council at its substantive session on its programmes and activities. This report will include a section which follows a common structure on the basis of specific areas designated by the Council or the Assembly. 27. The same arrangements should apply to the Committee on Food Aid Policies and Programmes of the World Food Programme, and consultations between the United Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations should be undertaken as soon as possible for this purpose, in view of the fact that the World Food Programme is an autonomous joint organ of both. This process should lead to the adoption of parallel resolutions by the General Assembly and the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization. B. Resources for operational activities 28. The fundamental characteristics of operational activities, especially those relating to their financing, as set forth in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, especially resolution 47/199, in particular the sixth preambular paragraph and paragraphs 3 and 4, are reaffirmed. 29. As part of the overall reform process, the funding mechanism of the operational activities should be strengthened in order to achieve a more predictable, continuous and assured funding basis. Any new funding system should include mechanisms for all participating countries to demonstrate their responsibility and commitment to the programmes and funds. Such mechanisms should distinguish between the financing arrangements for contributions by developed countries and others in a position to do so, as against the capacity for voluntary contributions from developing countries. 30. To facilitate the development of such a system, the Secretary-General is requested to review and analyse possible changes and improvements in the present funding system, including, but not limited to, multi-year negotiated pledges, and to submit a report with his recommendations in August 1993. The report could include, if possible, an assessment of the likely impact of each option on the overall level of funding and on the level of contributions. 31. The process would include consultations to be held in New York in September 1993 for a period of no more than five days and negotiations on prospective new modalities for financing in a resumed session of the General Assembly in early 1994. Secretariat: the enhanced role and capability of the United Nations Secretariat 32. The Secretariat administrative reforms should take into account the intergovernmental agreements on the restructuring of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields with a view better to serve the activities of Member States in the Second and Third Committees of the General Assembly, the Council and its subsidiary bodies. 33. The ongoing Secretariat reform process is noted. It has the potential to enhance the role of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields, particularly in the area of research and analysis of global development trends. There is, however, a need to further examine ways and means to enhance the modalities of reporting in the economic, social and related fields. The Secretary-—General is requested to make recommendations to the Economic and Social Council at its 1993 session to this effect, including recommendations on the advantages of establishing a system of integrated reports in the economic, social and related fields. D. Review 34. Additional efforts shall be made to further improve the functioning of the United Nations in the field of operational activities. Appropriate arrangements should be made for a comprehensive review of the implementation of the present resolution as well as of decisions on financing, including the possibility of considering those matters at a high-level meeting of the Council in 1997 and at the fifty-second session of the Assembly. That review will include further consideration of the issue of composition of the Executive Boards. ANNEX II Division of labour between the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council A. Guidelines 1.

B. Reports 2. The preparation of all reports shall take into consideration the division of labour outlined in paragraph 1 above. To that end, reports from subsidiary organs, the specialized agencies and other bodies of the United Nations system must contain sections referring to one or all of the following, as appropriate: (i) monitoring of the implementation of all previous decisions; (ii) policy recommendations; and (iii) coordination recommendations. The pertinent sections of each report should be discussed in the Assembly or the Council according to the responsibilities of each according to the Charter of the United Nations. 3. The total number of reports requested for each year should be reduced. When a biennial programme of work is adopted, the Secretariat should indicate whether it is in a position to provide the documentation in accordance with the six-week rule. If that is not the case, arrangements must be made to ensure that the Secretariat can comply with the six-week rule in regard to all documentation for the economic, social and related fields. C.
