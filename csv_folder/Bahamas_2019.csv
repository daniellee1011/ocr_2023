Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to the child’s family, benefiting the child directly; 27.

Recalls that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities® requires all States parties to ensure the full enjoyment by children with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, including with respect to family life; 24. Reaffirms that children shall not be separated from their parents against their will except when competent authorities, subject to judicial review, determine in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child, and that such determination may be necessary in a particular case such as one involving abuse or neglect of the child by the parents, or one where the parents are living separately and a decision must be made as to the child’s place of residence; 25. Reaffirms that a child shall not be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily and that the arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, and that every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age; 8/15 26. Notes that children without parental care are more likely than their peers to experience human rights violations, such as exclusion, violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation, and in this regard expresses deep concern on the potential harm of institutionalization and institutional care to children’s growth and development; 27. Recognizes that many children living without parental care have families, including at least one parent alive and/or relatives, and in this regard encourages actions to achieve family reunification unless it is not in the best interests of the child; 28. Stresses that no child should be forced to give up family connections in order to escape poverty, or to receive care, comprehensive, timely and quality health services or education, or because they are in contact with the law; 29. Recognizes that poverty, all forms of violence, including mental and physical violence, domestic violence, structural violence and survival activities may lead children into the criminal justice system, including the juvenile justice system, and that detention in the criminal justice system is sometimes used as a substitute for prevention and referral to child protection authorities and services; 30. Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers and legal guardians, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to their family, benefiting the child directly; 31. Urges States to strengthen child welfare and child protection systems and improve care reform efforts, which should include increased multisectoral collaboration, inter alia, between child welfare and health, education and justice sectors, active coordination among all relevant authorities, improved cross-border systems and improved capacity-building and training programmes for relevant stakeholders; 32. Expresses deep concern regarding the large and growing number of migrant children, particularly those who are unaccompanied or separated from their parents or primary caregivers, who may be particularly vulnerable along their journey, and expresses the commitment to protect the human rights of migrant children, given their vulnerability, in particular unaccompanied migrant children and migrant children with disabilities, to ensure that they receive appropriate protection and assistance and to provide for their health, education and psychosocial development, ensuring that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in policies on integration, return and family reunification; 33. Calls upon States to take all measures necessary to prevent and combat illegal adoptions and all adoptions that are not in the best interests of the child; 34. Urges States to take effective action to provide support to families and to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their parents, including by: (a) Prioritizing investments in child protection services and social services to support quality alternative care, including families and communities in order to prevent the separation of children from their families, with the best interests of the child as the primary consideration; (b) Adopting and enforcing laws and improving the implementation of policies and programmes, budget allocation and human resources to support children, particularly children with disabilities, and children living in disadvantaged, stigmatized and marginalized families, to address the root causes of unnecessary family separation and ensure that they are cared for effectively by their own families and communities; 9/15 (c) Taking all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child; (d) Recognizing the right of a child who has been placed by competent authorities for the purposes of care, protection or treatment of his or her physical or mental health, to a periodic review of the treatment provided to the child and all other circumstances relevant to his or her placement; (e) Ensuring that removal of children from the care of their family should be seen as a measure of last resort and should, whenever possible, be temporary and removal decisions should be regularly reviewed and the child’s return to parental care, once the causes of removal have been resolved or have disappeared, should have the best interests of the child as a primary consideration and be based on comprehensive assessment; (f) Developing and strengthening inclusive and responsive family-oriented policies and programmes for poverty reduction, also designed to promote and strengthen parents’ ability to care for their children, and to confront family poverty and social exclusion, recognizing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on inclusive and quality education and lifelong learning for all, including initiatives to promote involved and positive parenting, health and well-being for all at all ages, equal access to economic resources, full and productive employment, decent work, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion and promoting and protecting the human rights of all family members; (g) Providing gender-sensitive and child-sensitive social protection systems, which are key to ensuring poverty reduction, including, as appropriate, targeted cash transfers for families in vulnerable situations, as can be the case of families headed by a single parent, in particular those headed by women or by children, and which are most effective in reducing poverty when accompanied by other measures, such as providing access to basic services, high-quality education, affordable quality childcare services and health-care services; (h) Supporting and assisting families’ and caregivers’ capacities in regard to child development, including through comprehensive education and training, and the promotion of involved and positive parenting to enable them to provide children with care in a safe environment;
