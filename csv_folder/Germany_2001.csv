International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Taking note with satisfaction of the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recalling the recommendations of the two World Conferences to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held in Geneva in

elimination of all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, discrimination against, inter alia, Africans, people of African descent, Arabs and Muslims, and incidents of xenophobia, Negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist and are even growing in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, Particularly alarmed at the rise of racist and xenophobic ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as an institutionalized governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance taking place in segments of many societies and perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which are directed against migrant workers and their families, Reaffirming, in this regard, the responsibility of Governments for safeguarding and protecting the rights of individuals within their jurisdiction against crimes perpetrated by racist

principal objectives of the two Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to this day to be victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination, Noting also with grave concern that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase, Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications, including the Internet, continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world, Aware that racism, being one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Calling for the promotion of tolerance and respect for cultural diversity as an important factor, among others, in eliminating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Recalling General Assembly resolution 48/91 of 20 December 1993, in which the Assembly proclaimed the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, beginning in 1993, and

Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, Having examined the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance

propaganda and incitement to racial hatred are spreading and that racism is taking increasingly violent forms, Stressing the need to recognize that acts of violence motivated by racial discrimination and xenophobia are crimes punishable by law, Stressing also the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, Acknowledging that indigenous people and persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities are at times vulnerable to particular forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Noting with concern the existence of multiple discrimination, in particular against women, Recognizing that failure, especially by public authorities and politicians, to combat racial discrimination and xenophobia is a factor encouraging their perpetuation in society, I.

CO-CHAIRM ECOMMENDATIONS FROM TH AD HOC WORKING GROUP i BASIS OF TH ESSION OF TH COP 4 s8I < mon LEGISLATIVE MANDATE AND BACKGROUND Legislative mandate By its decision 6/COP.3, the Conference of the Parties decided to establish an ad hoc working group to review and analyse in depth, at the fourth session, reports submitted at its third session and reports that will be submitted at its fourth session in order to draw conclusions and propose concrete recommendations on further steps in the implementation of the Convention. By the same decision, the Executive Secretary of the UNCCD was requested to make all necessary arrangements for the above-mentioned ad hoc working group (AHWG) to fulfil its mandate and to meet at the fourth session. Further to consultations with interest and regional groups and in order to facilitate the decision on the ad hoc working group, the Secretariat prepared document ICCD/COP(4)/3/Add.7 (A), outlining a proposal for the work plan of the ad hoc working group and its objectives. This document, was well received by the Parties. Pursuant to decision 1/COP.4, the AHWG received its procedural guidelines. It is worth recalling here that one of the criteria for selecting national reports to be reviewed at COP4 was the date of ratification and the adoption and/or elaboration of a national action programme of the countries. Some subregional and regional reports were also considered. In this context, inputs from reports of developed country parties, United Nations organizations, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations, that supported project activities in the concerned affected country Parties, wer xpected to also enrich this review. Due to the size of the report review exercise, the Parties agreed on an inter- sessional meeting of up to 15 working days of the AHWG before COP 5. This was seen to be a necessary arrangement for processing the backlog of reports through an equitable review of all country reports submitted to the secretariat at COP 3 and COP 4. The decision on procedures stipulated that the AHWG would review all national reports individually prior to COP 5 and analyze reports by adopting thematic approaches without neglecting other issues contained in the reports. The ICCD/COP(4)/11/Add.1 Page 7 ad hoc working group invited the CST and the Global Mechanism to provide advice and information to be used for the review of the implementation of the Convention. Election of the Bureau The following Bureau was elected: Co-Chairmen: Mr. Mohamed Mahmoud El-Ghaouth (Mauritania) and Mr. Willem R. J. Van Cotthem (Belgium) Vice Chairmen: Mr. Octavio Perez Pardo (Argentina), Mr. Mohammad Reza Jabbari (Iran), (Rapporteur) Mr. Ogtay Jafarov (Azerbaijan) Preparation for the review of national reports The Group had to review the reports of 10 African, 6 Asian and 4 Latin American countries, plus those of 2 countries from the regional Annex IV and one report from Eastern Europe. Regional and subregional activities for all annexes were to be discussed at the end of the review process for each regional annex, within the time frame available. In order to maintain the desired coherence of presentations for reasons of comparability, the secretariat had invited the listed countries and regional groups presenting their national reports to include the following points in their presentation: assessment of measures taken; analysis of the obstacles in implementing the Convention; update on progress made since the submission of the report and assessment of the current status; suggestion as how to solve identified problems and next course of action. It was understood that this broad framework that was tentatively proposed would easily be enriched by the topics of priority interest contained in operative paragraph 2(b) of decision 1/COP.4. Comments Dby concerned international organizations, and, above all, comments from developed country partners were expected to bring added value to this exchange. The Co-chairmen also were aware that, in the light of the late approval of this very process, it had not been possible, for those who presented their reports, to prepare for it as extensively as Parties might have wished. They consider the process to be in its initial earning phase, they intend to draw the lessons of xperience gained and therefore they suggested that any constructive observation and criticism from all concerned Parties in the COP 4 segment of the AHWG review would help to fully meet Parties’ expectations in the resumed phase of the exercise. Hence, this interim report aims at extracting preliminary elements and observations from the COP 4 segment of the country report review 1in the understanding that full lessons and related recommendations will be presented in a final comprehensive report after the inter-sessional meeting. ICCD/COP(4)/11/Add.1 Page 8 ASPECTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS Broad features of the proceedings The national reports review provided a more specific complement to the brief review that took place in the COW on the overview and the synthetic aspects of the implementation of t he Convention. The initial work of the AHWG was considered an iterative process aiming at maximizing the lessons from experience as distilled through the national reports. The first session of the AHWG heard the following reports: 2. Senegal 13. United Republic of 24. Argentina Tanzania . 16. Taj 27 3 5 Benin kistan Regional America and |l Latin the Caribbean 6. Subregional - UMA 17. Uzbekistan 28. Portugal 7. Subregiona 18. . i CILSS/CEDEAO Turkmenistan 19. Mongolia . Regional Northern Mediterranean Lesotho 20. Lao People’s . Republic of Moldova Democratic Republic 9. 1 Regional Africa 2 Regional Asia The Co-chairmen are pleased with the high quality of presentations and the rich content of the exchanges. They commend affected country Parties for their thorough preparation and excellent delivery. Likewise, participants expressed their appreciation for the comprehensiv xtent of the reports’ coverage, the substantive information content, the candid assessment of obstacles and constraints and the useful summary of lessons learnt. Comments and exchanges following the presentations of the national reports aimed at seeking or providing complementary clarifications, offering advice or highlighting areas of common interest. Affected countries from the same region often focused on shared areas of concern. Developed country Parties emphasized relevant methodologies and approaches. On the whole, thes xchanges did not draw well defined conclusions from the analysis of the reports and thus did not provide sufficient elements to chart the path forward for the implementation process. Hence, many participants called for more concrete and constructive feedback. The Chairman of the CST noted the consistently weak reference made to the scientific and technical work of the CST in the national reports in fields such as benchmark and indicators, traditional knowledge or early warning systems. The CST ICCD/COP(4)/11/Add.1 Page 9 proposed to the COP a number of pertinent decisions to address these shortcomings and suggested, inter alia, the revision of the secretariat Help Guide. The CST and the Global Mechanism are invited to bring their contribution to the review of implementation at the resumed session of the AHWG in conformity with the COP’s decision on its procedures. It is expected that the Global Mechanism would provide information, in particular on support it can provide to countries in the light of its mandate. The Co-chairmen suggest that no focus should be put on physical data and welcome mor mphasis on success stories. A synthesis of issues drawn from the substantive exchanges, including the identification of best practices and of common difficulties and challenges and regional aspects as appropriate, be contained in the final comprehensive report to allow readers to benefit from the accumulated experience of all Parties having submitted a report at COP 3 and COP 4. Presentation of affected country Parties [ Given the number of presentations, participants greatly appreciated the us f visual support instruments. National reports usually covered such matters as c a I t T e nstitutional development, legislative, policy and enabling frameworks, national oordination, participatory mechanisms and partnership networking, awareness raising nd capacity building, funding issues and, many times, benchmarks and indicators. n doing so they also covered questions pertaining to inter ministerial cooperation, he field level consultative process and the mobilization of the civil society. hey called for a better integration of longer term environmental measures into conomic policies, instruments and practices. The need for predictable financial support was consistently identified as a pressing constraint at a time when national coordination bodies in charge of the UNCCD plan to move from NAP-preparation to the operational phase of field activities. The role of the Global Mechanism in facilitating and securing funding was acknowledged. Presentation of subregional and regional programmes Subregional and regional institutions presented their respective programmes. They reported on institutional developments such as the establishment of ministerial consultations, integrated planning frameworks, Coordination Committees and Thematic Groups and the use of Internet exchange forums. It was highlighted that SRAPs have the potential to turn into a cost effective channel for providing support to the NAPs in the concerned subregions. Regional and subregional institutions assisted member states in the preparation of the COPs and some delegations stated that their useful role deserved enhanced support. Emphasis was put on South-South cooperation, finding responses to challenges in areas of common interest, notably in relationship with the work of the Committee on Science and Technology. Transboundary pilot projects have been launched between neighboring countries in some subregions. Support was provided to member states for the preparation of NAPs. Technical difficulties relate notably to the harmonization of evaluation parameters, Dbenchmarks and indicators. The transaction cost of coordination and networking was recalled. ICCD/COP(4)/11/Add.1 Page 10 TENTATIVE HIGHLIGHTS ON KEY THEMATIC TOPICS (to be completed after the resumed session of the AHWG) Identification of best practices and successes At the institutional level some progress was registered in putting into place or reactivating the necessary normative framework to encourage decentralization for natural resources management under the UNCCD. Progress was also achieved in improving the conditions for partnership, through the identification and coordination of complementary initiatives through sectoral or thematic planning instruments. The decentralization process in many instances was supported by consultative mechanisms at regional and local levels that can serve the development process far and beyond the Convention. Communication strategies to this effect integrated traditional and recent technologies in support of participatory development. Countries and NGOs reported positive results 1in the strengthening of capacities for key actors of the civil society to identify and address challenges linked to sustainable development. In this &respect measures in support of participatory development could be better reflected in the Help Guide. Affected developed country Parties reported success in their awareness-raising efforts and were impressed with a strong response from the population, municipalities and academic institutions which demonstrated a growing interest in UNCCD related issues. It was noted that considerable progress was being made on critical issues such as improved natural resources governance, land tenure or the promotion of women’s role in rural development. The point was made, notably in the African context, that there was a wealth of successful experiences at micro-level in relevant areas such as efficient use of water, land reclamation, range management or protection of the vegetal cover. Initiatives under the UNCCD framework to gather resources to multiply and replicate these successful experiences at field level are strongly recommended. Identification of main difficulties, obstacles and challenges At the institutional evel, the national coordination bodies are not always anchored at th required v of decision making to bring coherence to the interventions of the concerned ministries. Nor are they always well equipped to mainstream experience gained under the NAP exercise into other strategic frameworks such as poverty reduction strategies. The Co-chairs recognize the considerable challenge the countries face in coordinating a multiplicity of agreements and strategies for environment and development, which often complicates the task of national implementation authorities. It was recognized that developed country Parties, as cooperation partners, are facing initial difficulties to internalize the Convention in their own aid delivery process and must adjust their own procedures for the delivery of programme resources in a manner deemed adequate to deliver their commitment as Party to this instrument. ICCD/COP(4)/11/Add.1 Page 11 Inappropriate policy frameworks at the macro level in areas such as, for instance, trade practices or agricultural subsidies can hamper progress into the fight against desertification. This points out in many cases to an insufficient integration of environmental and economic policies. The mobilization of financial resources from member countries and international partners remain a core challenge, notably as the process moves from the phase of NAP preparation to the phase of NAP implementation. In that context, a lack of response to push forward the forthcoming phase could demobilize key stakeholders. It must be noted that the challenge for establishing mechan partnership arrangements is also acute at the subregional and regiona level. Several interventions thus called for GEF support for UNCCD enabling activities. Coordination of external financial flows was also perceived as a difficult isms for challenge. Affected developing countries were invited to bring forward priority projects or programmes from the NAPs in their regular discussions with developed country Parties. Beyond anthropogenic factors, climate change with its context of worsening drought and unreliable rainfall patterns is perceived as a growing threat. Level of participation of all actors, including financial and technical support from developed countries Manifestation of political will through the national decision making and the budget allocation process (to be elaborated after the resumed session of the AHWG) Participatory development process involving the civil society, NGOs and CBOs (to be elaborated after the resumed session of the AHWG) Establishment of consultative mechanisms for the conclusion of partnership agreements (to be elaborated after the resumed session of the AHWG) Linkages and synergies with other conventions on the environment and development Linkages and synergies with other Multilateral Environment Agreements and/or strategic frameworks on environment and development wer ncouraged. Synergistic programmes should benefit, at field level, from efforts under the UNCCD to promote capacity building initiatives such as participatory farming systems and farmer friendly networking structures that take into account biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration and other topics of interest in the combat of desertification. Some studies are under way, at national level, to assess implications of and potential for synergistic measures between the UNCCD, UNFCC and CBD. It was observed that the upcoming initiatives under the International Forest Forum should ICCD/COP(4)/11/Add.1 Page 12 also be integrated. Support through the Joint Programme CBD/UNCCD could assist affected countries in their assessment efforts. Strategies established within the framework of sustainable development plans and/or policies For the UNCCD issues to be fully represented in the process of the coordination of policies and strategic frameworks for sustainable development, it is necessary that the expression of national political will, domestic investments and the commitment of international partners b xpressed through concrete mechanisms at national level. It was agreed that a critical level of NAP development should be achieved for successful linkages with other policies or strategies, notably those aiming at poverty reduction because the consideration of such relationships remains theoretical as long as the NAP implementation has not effectively started. The constitution of national think tanks, steering groups and /or the production of studies on synergistic programmes development should be encouraged. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CO-CHAIRMEN ON THE BASIS OF THE COP 4 SESSION OF THE AHWG Recommendations for the resumed session of the AHWG Affected country Parties presenting their reports during the inter- session of the AHWG are invited to take fully into account the procedures to review reports submitted at the third and fourth sessions of the COP contained in decision 1/COP.4, notably 1its operative paragraph 2. In the light of the important number of reports to be submitted during the resumed session of the AHWG, the affected country Parties are, to the extent possible, invited to make use of multi-media equipment. Developed country Parties participating in the review of these reports are invited to provide specific feedback on the conclusions they reach and the steps they intend to take in the light of the submission of reports from affected country Parties. As demonstrated at the COP 4 session of the AHWG, developed country Parties should continue to use the learning opportunity offered by the review process to further ducat their ongoing Dbilateral and multilateral aid efforts to assist developing country Parties. Developed country Parties are encouraged to actively incorporate their response to the reports into their consideration of future assistance measures. Relevant international organizations are requested to contribute more actively to the review process through a presentation of measures they are taking in response to the issues and concerns expressed in the national reports. ICCD/COP(4) /11/Add.1 Page 13 Presentations and exchanges during th resumed session should facilitate forward looking conclusions on the substance of the matters under review and the next steps to be taken in order to foster the implementation process. If time permits, presentations from countries of a given region could be concluded by an informal wrap up of main lessons learnt and priority themes to be addressed. There would thus be opportunities for such exchanges for each of the regional implementation annexes. Likewise it 1is suggested to accommodate, to the extent possible, a review of the reports of developed country Parties and relevant international organizations. 2. With regard to the NAP preparation process, the Co-chairmen also would like to launch an appeal to the countries in position to do so, to complete and adopt their NAP instruments so as to be in a position to report on new developments at the inter-session of the AHWG. They also invite partner countries and international organizations to provide early support to these effort. 3. The resumed session should take place at a location that facilitates maximum participation. The Co-Chairmen: Mr. Mohamed Mahmoud El-Ghaouth Mr. Willem R. J.

I. We, th members of parliament meeting at Bonn, Germany, from 12 to 13 December 2000, for the third Round Table at the invitation of the Convention secretariat and the German Federal Bundestag, with the full support of the Inter- Parliamentary Union, in the context of the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those Countries experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa, reiterat th declaration we adopted at Dakar, Senegal, and at Recife, Brazil, on our role as members of parliaments in the implementation of the Convention, and being greatly concerned with the lack of progress in combating of desertification worldwide, We declare that: We are conscious that approximately 1 population and 25 per cent of the total land area of the Earth are directly affected by land degradation and desertification processes. We share fully the founding pre mise of to Combat Desertification, according to which sustainable developme cannot be attained unless: (a) 1 addresses the interests of affected popul main objectives the alleviation affected populations and 1local of pove communi process as well as in the imple mentatio environment, to improve the management of land and water resources a to overcome the main causes of land degradation and desertification; the United Nations Convention nt t is clearly oriented towards people, lations and has as one of its rty; (b) it fully involves ties 1in the decision-making n of measures to protect the nd We are greatly concerned that desertification processes sever losses of productivity implied by growth, threaten food security and ly undermine sustainable economic xacerbate susceptibility to famine, which are often accompanied by large-scale movements of displaced people. The failure of marginally productive land to <cope with population pressures, together with increasingly variable climates, including recurrent drought, may already have displaced as many as 25 million people worldwide from their land and constituted a source of inter-communal conflict in many parts of the world. Additionally, we are equally concerned that women and children, the socially and economically weak, tend to be hit hardest by the serious consequences of desertification; We are deeply concerned with the gravity of the situation in different regions of the world, such as in Africa, a continent where deserts or arid zones constitute two thirds of the total land area and where 73 per cent of the arid land is already seriously or moderately degraded; in Asia where approximately 71 per cent of the Continent’s arid lands are severely degraded; in Latin America and the Caribbean, where nearly three quarters of the arid land, representing almost one fourth of the region, is moderately or severely degraded; the Mediterranean, where almost two thirds of the arid land 1is severely degraded, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where from 40 to 80 per cent of the arid land is severely degraded. IT. Conscious of the economic losses that result from decreasing the productive capacity of land resources and convinced that preventing further land degradation and desertification is more cost effective than remedying its environmental, social and economic consequences, w as members of parliament acknowledge that such consequences fall hardest on developing countries, that remediation programmes compete for scant financial resources and that, at the same time, these countries in fulfilling their international agreements have to divert considerable resources for debt repayment and servicing. We, therefore: Urge the international community to seriously consider the ordeal and marginalization of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) and urge it to implement appropriat relief measures, particularly in those countries seriously affected by drought and desertification; Reaffirm the importance of ensuring access to appropriate financial resources, including new and additional ones, for affected developing countries 1in order to allow them to fully deliver the obligation contracted under the UNCCD; Welcome in this regard the decision taken by the Council of t Environmental facility (GEF) during its meeting held in Washington D.C. he Global from 1 to 3 November 2000, by which it requested the Chief Officer (CEO) of the GEF to explore the best options to strengthen the support of the GEF to affected developing countries, particularly in Africa, in their process of implementation of UNCCD; Executiv Urge the international community, and particularly the executive branches of Parties to take all necessary measures for the establishment of a new window within the GEF for the specific purpose of financing the incremental costs of the UNCCD implementation; Call for a concerted effort by bodies of the UN System, regional development Dbanks, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to enhance desertification monitoring systems as a support for sustainable agricultural policies, better water resource and forest management, land use planning, as well as urban planning; Invite executive branches of government 1in deve consider the formulation of revenue-neutral na loping countries to counter further land degradation and desertification. These policies should be justified on the basis of avoidance of fu tional policies to ture costs resulting from biodiversity loss, adverse effects of climate change, further encroachment of deserts into arable land areas, increased displacement of people and refugee flows, and amplified pote ntial for conflicts within poor countries and between neighbouring countries; Urge international organizations and developed countries to increase assistance to developing countries in the implementation of their own domestic policies in combating desertification. These policies should fully integrat th advers consequences of land degradation and desertification into economic, social, agricultural and land planning; and Fully support all initiatives of agencies, donor countries and civil society to mobilise new and additional financial resources to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification as a concrete tool for ensuring the promotion of sustainable development in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems. ITI. In affirming our commitment, as members of parliaments, to contribute fully to the implementation of the Convention, we agree to initiate or continue serious efforts in the national parliaments of developed countries to strengthen technical and financial assistance to combat desertification in the most affected and poorest countries, attaching central importance to support for their own self-help efforts. We also commit ourselves: To convene an annual special event, the “International Day to Combat Desertification”, in our parliaments on 17 June to raise awareness on the implementation of the Convention and to support such initiatives as commemorative postal stamps, among others; To strengthen national initiatives to enhance the fight against desertification; To advocate increased financial and technical support from national budgets to combat desertification and land degradation; To submit, where necessary, to the executive branches of governments a proposal for the inclusion in school curricula of disciplines focusing on the protection of the environment and of natural resources, particularly land and water resources, so as to make combating erosion and desertification a priority for our countries, as well as for our regional and subregional organizations; IV. We note those countries that have ratified the Convention and urge those that have not yet ratified it to do so as soon as possible as a concrete step towards a concerted effort to combat desertification. Moreover, we support the active participation of all parliaments in the implementation of the Convention including, where necessary, the introduction, strengthening and implementation of legislation relating to the fight against desertification and the ©protection and preservation of ecosystems in countries affected; we urge Parliaments and the international community to address desertification not only as a serious environmental and/or problem, but also as a serious hindrance to development with social and political consequences. In doing so, ecological severe long-term global economic, V. In highlighting the fundamental role that technical assistance, enhanced environmental monitoring and capacity building p ay in the cha enge to achieve sustainable development, we members of parliament, wurge donor agencies and countries to consider strengthening their support for the following measures, building upon self-help efforts to be made by dev loping countries: Awareness raising on production and consumption patterns and their impact on the land; Water and river basin management; Improvement of technical land and water management skills; Sustainable use of scarce natural resources including renewable sources of energy; Promotion of specific research on the causes and negative effects of desertification; sound technologies for and th ffective use of drought-resistant Transfer and adaptation of environmentally better land and natural resource management, and safe Dbio-technologies to disseminate modern species; Use of state-of-the-art information technologies such as geographic information systems, the rational and integrated management of river basins, and the protection, promotion and utilization of traditional and site-specific technological knowledge and practices; Reforestation and forest conservation to combat desertification caused by drought as well as by deforestation due to population increase, overgrazing, illegal and excessive logging, bush and forest fires, etc; Agricultural development, for example, by establishing sustainable irrigation facilities to secure stable water supplies; Capacity building such as training sessions and despatch of experts to nhanc th scientific and technical capacity, taking into consideration the special role of women, for combating desertification; 10.

Notes that the spirit of Council of Europe resolution AP (90) 3 of 18 October 1990 is still relevant. The prescription of benzodiazepines should have regard to the following matters: (a) The need for a medical investigation to justify their prescription; (b) The setting of precise indications and prescriptions for the shortest possible period of time; (c) The discontinuation of unnecessary treatments; (d) The use of the lowest possible doses; (e) The risk of accidents for drivers and machine operators; (f) The recommendation that alcohol or psychotropic medicaments that might interact with benzodiazepines should not be taken at the same time as benzodiazepines; II TRAINING FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS Emphasizes the importance of initial and in-service training for relevant health professionals concerning the appropriate use of benzodiazepines. Such training should include diagnostic tools, methods for stopping treatment and information about alternative therapies or medicines; Recommends that patients be closely involved in the conduct of their treatment.

If necessary, health professionals and the general public should be informed about such matters; X1I CONTROL MEASURES Considers that monitoring and control are important tools in the elimination of benzodiazepine misuse. Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures (involving prescription, dispensing, measures to combat illegal trafficking, withdrawal of medicines etc.) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking; XIII NATIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES Emphasizes the decisive role played by competent national authorities, which can involve medical prescriptions, dispensing, pharmaceutical presentation, control methods, statistical systems, monitoring, training and research on benzodiazepines.

2001,General Assembly,Sixth Committee,Fifty-sixth session,N/A,United Nations Asernon,"We have the honour to request, pursuant to rule 14 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the inclusion in the agenda of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly of a supplementary item entitled “International convention against the reproductive cloning of human beings”. In view of the multidisciplinary nature and legal complexities of the issue, we believe it would be appropriate to allocate the item to the Sixth Committee of the General Assembly. Pursuant to rule 20 of the rules of procedure, this request is accompanied by an",N/A,Signed) Yves Doutriaux (Signed) Hanns Schumacher,"A/56/192 Annex I to the letter dated 7 August 2001 from the Chargés d’affaires a.i. of the Permanent Missions of France and Germany to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General Explanatory memorandum Within the general issue of biotechnological advances which open up prospects as regards health and also give rise to new ethical issues, the announcement by certain laboratories and researchers that they intend to proceed in the near future with reproductive cloning of human beings poses a particularly serious problem in terms of human dignity and identity and calls for an urgent initiative. While it is true that, at present, only a small number of researchers or scientific institutions have the technical capacity to perform such operations, there is no doubt that such operations would have an impact on the entire human family. It should be recalled, in this connection, that article 11 of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights drawn up by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and endorsed by the General Assembly in resolution 53/152 states that “Practices which are contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning of human beings, shall not be permitted”. It is in answer to this challenge that France and Germany are proposing an initiative to engage, within the universal context of the United Nations, negotiations on an international legal instrument banning the reproductive cloning of human beings. These negotiations must be open to all States and to the participation of specialized agencies, in particular UNESCO and the World Health Organization (WHO). Moreover, such negotiations should benefit in due course, from the relevant work of the group of independent experts called for by the Commission on Human Rights* to reflect on the possible follow-up to the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights. Because of its multidisciplinary nature the issue could not be dealt with in all its aspects in any of the specialized agencies (such as the Commission on Human Rights, UNESCO, WHO) and it therefore falls within the competence of the General Assembly. Within the General Assembly, it is the Sixth Committee which seems the most suited to conduct negotiations on elaborating a legally binding instrument which will, no doubt, pose complex legal and technical problems. The French- German initiative deliberately focuses on a specific aspect of a larger debate, in regard to which the necessary coherence should be maintained, regardless of the forum in which it is discussed. In view of the complex nature of this subject, it would be preferable to take a two-step approach. Thus, it is suggested that the General Assembly adopt a resolution at its fifty-sixth session whereby it would decide to open negotiations on an international legal instrument banning the reproductive cloning of human beings and establishing, for this purpose, an open-ended ad hoc committee of the Sixth Committee responsible, initially, for defining a negotiation mandate and, subsequently, for conducting the negotiations. It is hoped that the mandate prepared by the ad hoc committee could be adopted by the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session so that the negotiation of the future instrument could begin in 2003. a Commission resolution 2001/71 of 25 April 2001 (adopted by consensus), para. 4.

INTRODUCTION A. Mandate 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP), at the first part of its sixth session, requested its President “to make proposals for the further development and consideration of ... texts at a resumed session and to seek the necessary advice beforehand in a transparent manner” (decision 1/CP.6 on Implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action). 2. The consolidated negotiating text which follows responds to the above request. It is derived from the negotiating texts that the Conference transmitted to the second part of the sixth session (see FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3 (vol. I-V) together with the texts contained in document FCCC/CP/2000/INF.3 (vol. I-V))."" In developing the consolidated negotiating text, the President was able to draw on the wealth of proposed amendments to his informal note of 3. The President also consulted widely in the inter-sessional period. He met with many Parties, both bilaterally and in groups, to receive their advice. In an effort to enhance transparency he made available to all Parties initial ideas on how some key political issues might be addressed.’ B. Scope of the note 4. The consolidated negotiating text proposed by the President seeks to present a comprehensive and balanced package of decisions on all issues covered by the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and, in this way, seeks to facilitate the negotiations on the outstanding issues. It should be seen as a single, integrated document although it is issued in several parts. This introduction contains an outline of the full consolidated negotiating text (see cover page above) as well as an overview. The main body of the consolidated text, comprising six addenda, contains the decisions to be considered and adopted by the Conference of the Parties, including, as appropriate, decisions recommended for adoption by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). 5. The purpose of the overview (see section Il below) is to provide background to some of the proposals made by the President, following his consultations, in developing the consolidated negotiating text. The decisions contained in documents FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.4 and Add.5 are not addressed in this overview. ' At the close of the first part of the sixth session, the negotiating texts under consideration totalled 285 pages and included some 2500 sets of brackets. C. Possible action by the Conference 6. The Conference may wish to consider the consolidated negotiating text, in conjunction with the negotiating texts that emerged from the first part of the session, as referred to in paragraph 2 above, and undertake the intensive negotiations that will lead to the adoption, at the close of the sixth session, of a comprehensive and balanced package of decisions on all issues covered by the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. II. OVERVIEW A. Approach 7. The negotiations within the framework of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action have aimed to elaborate on modalities and procedures for implementing the Kyoto Protocol and, at the same time, to find ways to advance the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), especially in relation to the priorities of developing country Parties. The unfinished business from these negotiations is currently before the COP. The adoption of decisions to complete the Buenos Aires Plan of Action is intended to provide the basis for the requisite number of Parties to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and bring it into force. The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol is acknowledged as an important step in a long-term process to find a response to global climate change that fulfils the objective of the Convention contained in its Article 2. 8. The consolidated negotiating text by the President presents a set of decisions that, in its entirety, tries to balance the disparate interests of Parties. It is hoped that the package as a whole contains sufficient “wins” for all Parties and, in this way, provides the basis for negotiations that lead to outcomes reflecting the common interest of all Parties in addressing climate change. 9. In view of the differences that remained on many issues at the end of the first part of the sixth session, the development of the consolidated negotiating text necessitated that choices be made on issues of great importance to Parties. The President has sought advice widely on these matters and, in the light of the advice received, has made the proposals contained in the consolidated negotiating text. The underlying philosophy is one of compromise for the common good. 10. Inreviewing the consolidated negotiating text, Parties should be aware that efforts have been made to enhance the level of coherence among the various decisions that had, heretofore, been negotiated in separate groups. This has been mainly an exercise in linguistic and terminological consistency. However, special attention has been paid to the proposed new institutions in an effort to present proposals that are legally and institutionally sound. Recognizing that all decisions of the COP are of equal legal standing, and that this will also be true of the decisions of the COP/MOP, there has also been an effort to reduce duplication and overlap, and to consolidate, where possible, common elements in one decision. Other decisions then refer to rather than repeat these common elements. 1. The proposals also seek to reaffirm institutional clarity in terms of the roles of the subsidiary bodies. An effort has been made, in the spirit of Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention, to give mandates to one subsidiary body rather than two. Each body can continue to seek input or advice from the other. 12. The sections which follow seek to highlight and explain the choices made by the President on some of the key issues. B. Finance, technology transfer, adaptation, capacity-building, Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention and Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol 13. The text on finance, technology transfer, adaptation, capacity-building, Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention and Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol is contained in document FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1. The basis for this text was the negotiating text that emerged from the first part of the sixth session (see FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3 (vol. I and II)). 14. Developing country Parties have sought to enhance the implementation of, inter alia, Article 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention, while also contributing to, and promoting, the development of related new mechanisms and approaches under the Kyoto Protocol. The proposals seek to respond to the concerns of developing country Parties and to their interest in being active partners in international efforts to respond to climate change, whether through sustainable development and emission limitation or through adaptation. These decisions are grouped in one addendum because they are interrelated and have financial resources at their core. 15. To enjoy the widespread support necessary for adoption, the decisions on the completion of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action must respect a number of political and economic realities. They should: (a) Enhance the implementation of Article 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of the Convention through new and additional resources; (b) Lead to improvements in the efficiency and productivity of existing funding mechanisms rather than creating new ones; Increase funding for capacity-building and adaptation; (c) (d) Address the concerns of countries listed in Article 4.8 of the Convention and of least developed countries. 16. The consolidated negotiating text includes, inter alia, the following proposals related to finance, technology transfer, adaptation, capacity-building, Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention and Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol: (a) The COP will strengthen its continuing guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the GEF is requested to streamline its procedures and policies, project cycle and delivery system. The GEF is also requested to ensure that projects are responsive to national needs and priorities and integrated in national programmes (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Additional guidance to an operating entity of the financial mechanism, paragraph 2); (b) Guidance will be provided to the financial mechanism to make resources available for the implementation of Stage III adaptation activities through the GEF climate change focal area (see FCCC/CP/2001/2Add. 1, decision on Additional guidance to an operating entity of the financial mechanism, paragraph 1 (c)); (c) An adaptation fund will be established to finance demonstration/pilot projects and programmes and concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing country Parties. It will be financed from the share of the proceeds of the clean development mechanism (CDM) (2 per cent of certified emission reductions generated) and contributions from Parties included in Annex I. The adaptation fund will be operated by a council, composed according to the formula in paragraph 28 below, under the guidance of the COP/MOP (with guidance to be provided by the COP in the period prior to entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol). The GEF will be invited to make the necessary arrangements for this purpose (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Funding and resource levels, paragraphs 1 to 8); (d) A special climate change fund will be established to finance activities, programmes and measures related to climate change (technology transfer, capacity-building, economic diversification, energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management). These activities, programmes and measures will be additional and complementary to those currently funded by the resources allocated to the GEF climate change focal area and by bilateral and multilateral funding. The special climate change fund will be operated by the GEF council, under the guidance of the COP/MOP (with guidance to be provided by the COP in the period prior to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol). The GEF will be invited to make the necessary arrangements for this purpose (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Funding and resource levels, paragraphs 9 to 14); (e) The priorities of least developed country (LDC) Parties will be addressed through a separate work programme to be established by the COP. This work programme will include, infer alia, national adaptation programmes of action (NAPA), which will be financed by the GEF in accordance with criteria to be developed by the GEF. A LDC group of experts will be established to assist in these NAPAs. In addition, CDM projects in LDCs will be exempted from the share of the proceeds for adaptation (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention, section III, and FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.6, decision on Modalities and procedures for a clean development mechanism, paragraph 12); 3] Activities, programmes and measures to promote the transfer of technology will be financed by the special climate change fund, the adaptation fund and the GEF climate change focal area. An intergovernmental consultative group of scientific and technical experts on technology transfer will be established under the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to address barriers to technology transfer, information needs and progress on technology transfer, as well as to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Development and transfer of technologies); (g) Inorder to address the impacts of response measures, Parties included in Annex [ will, in accordance with Article 4.8 of the Convention, assist Parties not included in Annex I by giving full consideration to the impacts of response measures and by addressing this through transfer of technologies relating to fossil fuels that capture and store greenhouse gases, capacity-building to improve the environmental efficiency of activities related to fossil fuels and economic diversification, based on methodological work (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention, section II). Developing country Parties will report on their needs and concerns. Parties included in Annex I will report in their national communications on action taken under Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol to minimise the adverse social, environmental and economic impacts on developing country Parties of their implementation of Article 3.1 of the Kyoto Protocol (such as reducing or phasing out subsidies for fossil fuel production, bearing in mind the obligation under the Convention that policies and measures should comprise all economic sectors) (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Matters relating to Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol, paragraph 4); (h) The COP will recommend to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the context of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, to establish a high-level climate resources committee, with specified tasks and limited membership. The committee will develop criteria for the review of climate change contributions, monitor funding needs and availability, advise on the allocation of resources, determine whether agreed targets for funding have been achieved, mobilize additional resources, and develop policy conclusions for consideration by existing financial channels and institutions (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Climate resources committee); Resourcing for the above-mentioned activities will be based on the following (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Funding and resource levels): @ Parties included in Annex I to contribute new and additional resources for climate change activities in Parties not included in Annex II, on a grant or concessional basis; (1) Total contributions to rise to US$ one billion per year as soon as possible and not later than 2005. As an indication, the amount to be used for adaptation to rise to approximately half the resource level, over a number of years; (i) Contributions to be based on Annex I Parties’ relative share of total carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. Those Parties included in Annex I undergoing the process of transition to a market economy shall make contributions to the fund proportional to 50 percent of their share of the total emissions in 1990; (iii) Financial flows entering into the calculation of this target to comprise: (iv) Contributions to the GEF that are allocated to the climate change focal area; Contributions to the special climate change fund; Contributions to the adaptation fund; Bilateral and multilateral funding for climate change activities that is additional to current funding levels. Public funding for CDM projects and the CDM share of proceeds will not enter into the calculation; V) Parties included in Annex I to report in their national communications on these financial flows; (vi) Based on advice from the climate resources committee, the COP is to keep under review the percentage allocated to the adaptation fund and total funding levels, taking into account resources generated by the CDM share of the proceeds; (vii) COP/MOP to provide guidance to the adaptation fund council and to the council managing the special climate change fund; COP/MOP to decide on policies programme priorities and eligibility criteria for both funds; the entity or entities managing the adaptation fund and the special climate change fund to report annually to the COP/MOP on the management of these funds. (viii) 17. Parties that fail to pay their share of the contributions target will be ineligible for seats in the new bodies (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1, decision on Funding and resource levels, paragraph 15 (e)). C. Mechanisms 18. The text on mechanisms pursuant to Articles 6, 12 and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol is contained in document FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2. The basis for this text was the negotiating text that emerged from the first part of the sixth session (see FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3 (vol. V)). 19. The negotiations on mechanisms involve a great amount of important technical detail cast against a background of key issues regarding the prerequisites and rules for the extent of their use. Decisions are needed on issues such as guiding principles, supplementarity to domestic action, matters related to Article 4, and the use of emission reduction units (ERUs), certified emissions reductions (CERs) and assigned amount units (AAUs), all of which are now contained in a decision on principles, nature and scope of the mechanisms. Such decisions are equally needed for determining eligibility criteria for Parties and projects, the starting date of the CDM and provisions for a commitment period reserve. Overall agreement to complete the Buenos Aires Plan of Action is only possible if compromises can be reached on these points. 20. To this end, the consolidated negotiating text includes, inter alia, the following proposals: (a) In using the mechanisms, Parties are to be guided by the objective and principles contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2, decision on Principles, nature and scope of the mechanisms, preamble). In this context: Policies and measures, based on national circumstances, are at the centre of the response to climate change along with sound modalities, rules and guidelines for the mechanisms, strict principles and rules governing land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities and a strong compliance regime. Such policies and measures should also seek to reduce inequalities in per capita emissions between developed and developing countries. In this context, and in order to address the issue of supplementarity, Parties included in Annex I must meet their emission limitation and reduction commitments inscribed in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol chiefly through domestic action since 1990, with relevant quantitative and qualitative information to be reported and reviewed. Provisions on the use of the mechanisms should apply individually to the Parties acting under Article 4; (1) CERs, ERUs, and AAUs may be used to meet commitments under Article 3.1, but without altering the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments inscribed in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol. CERs may also be banked towards meeting commitments in the second commitment period. It is thus recognized that the Kyoto Protocol has not created any right, title or entitlement to emissions which affect the consideration of decisions on subsequent commitment periods. (i) (b) The eligibility to participate in the mechanisms by Parties included in Annex I will be dependent on compliance with methodological and reporting requirements under Articles 5.1,5.2,7.1 and 7.4 of the Kyoto Protocol, with oversight being provided by the enforcement branch of the compliance committee. Only Parties that have accepted the agreement on compliance supplementing the Kyoto Protocol will be entitled to use credits generated by the use of the mechanisms (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2, decision on Guidelines for the implementation of Article 6, annex, paragraphs 16 and 17, decision on Modalities and procedures for a clean development mechanism, annex, paragraphs 30 and 31, and decision on Modalities, rules and guidelines for emissions trading, annex, paragraphs 2 and 3); (c) On issues related to Article 6 (Joint implementation), there are two ways for verifying reductions: the Annex I host Party itself may verify if it meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph 20 (b) above; if this is not the case, an independent verification procedure is to be pursued. In analogy to the CDM, Parties included in Annex I shall refrain from using nuclear facilities for generating ERUs (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2, decision on Guidelines for the implementation of Article 6, and annex, sections B-E); (d) With regard to issues related to Article 12, a prompt start for the CDM is envisaged with the executive board being elected by COP 7. Operational provisions under the CDM specify that a non-Annex I host Party is to judge whether a project activity is in line with its national strategy and/or priorities on sustainable development. Notwithstanding, Parties included in Annex I will refrain from using nuclear facilities for generating CERs. If public funding from Parties included in Annex I is used for CDM projects, this should not result in the diversion of official development assistance. In order to facilitate the equitable regional distribution of CDM projects, simplified procedures will apply to specific small-scale projects, with the possibility of the executive board reviewing and, if necessary, recommending additional categories to the COP/MOP. It should also be recalled that CDM projects in LDCs are to be exempt from the share of proceeds for funding adaptation (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2, decision on Modalities and procedures for a clean development mechanism); (e) Afforestation and reforestation projects are to be the only eligible land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCEF) projects under the CDM during the first commitment period. Implementation of such projects will be guided by the principles referred to in paragraph 23 (b) below and modalities to be developed by the SBSTA for decision at COP 8. The modalities to be addressed include non-permanence, additionality, leakage, scale, uncertainties, socio-economic and environmental impacts (including impacts on bio-diversity and natural ecosystems). Treatment of LULUCF projects under the CDM in future commitment periods is to be decided as part of the negotiations on the second commitment period (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2, decision on Modalities and procedures for a clean development mechanism, paragraphs 8 and 9); 3] On issues related to Article 17 (Emissions trading), a Party included in Annex | is to maintain, in its national registry, a commitment period reserve which should not drop below 90 per cent of the Party’s assigned amount calculated pursuant to Article 3.7 and 3.8 of the Kyoto Protocol or five times its most recently reviewed inventory, whichever is lowest (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2, decision Modalities, rules and guidelines for emissions trading, Annex, paragraphs 6 to 9). D. Land-use, land-use change and forestry 21. The text on land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) is contained in document FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.3. The basis for this text was the negotiating text that emerged from the first part of the sixth session (see FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3 (vol. IV)). 22. During the President’s inter-sessional consultations, the high importance attached to LULUCEF by many Parties was confirmed. Sinks play a key role in the international response to climate change. No overall agreement on the Buenos Aires Plan of Action is possible without reflecting this reality. The President’s proposals seek to confirm and clarify the role for LULUCEF activities while at the same time including: (a) Safeguards to guarantee substantial levels of emission reductions in Parties included in Annex I; Safeguards to ensure environmental integrity; (b) Careful accounting procedures; (c) Provisions for further technical work to improve the state of knowledge. (d) 23. The consolidated negotiating text includes, inter alia, the following proposals on LULUCEF: Definitions of “forests”, “afforestation”, “reforestation” and “deforestation”; (a) (b) Principles governing LULUCF activities (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.3, decision (/CMP.1) on Land-use, land-use change and forestry); (c) A decision that activities in the fields of forest management, cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation will be eligible under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.3, decision on Land-use, land-use change and forestry, annex, paragraph 6); (d) Accounting rules, including a three-tiered proposal for eligible activities under Article 3.4 that involves: Compensation of possible Article 3.3 debits through accounting for forest management (up to 8.2 megatons of carbon per Party per year) (no discount applied to Article 3.4 credits up to this level); (1) An 85 per cent discount on forest management activities beyond the first tier; (i) Net-net accounting for agricultural management. (See FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.3, decision on Land-use, land-use change and forestry, annex, paragraphs 8, 9 and 11.) (iii) (e) An exemption for the application of the discount described in paragraph 23 (d) above to a level of 13 megatons of carbon per year, in case a Party meets three criteria related to energy efficiency, forest cover, and population density (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.3, decision on Land-use, land-use change and forestry, annex, paragraph 10); 3] The following two “boundary conditions” are applied to the sum total of LULUCEF credits in the first commitment period resulting from: Article 3.4 (the second and third tiers as specified in paragraph 23 (d) (ii) and (iii) above), ERUs (in accordance with Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol) and CERs (in accordance with Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol): The total amount of credits is not to exceed half of the reduction commitment of a Party if its reduction commitment in Annex B is less than 100; @ The total amount of credits is not to exceed 2.5 per cent of the base year emissions per year of a Party times five if its reduction commitment in Annex B is 100 or greater. (See FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.3, decision on Land-use, land-use change and forestry, annex, paragraphs 18 and 19.) (i) (2) Requests to the SBSTA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to undertake further work: consideration of methodologies for the possible inclusion of degradation and devegetation under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol in the first commitment period, and the investigation of the application of biome-specific forest definitions for future commitment periods. SBSTA: elaboration of reporting guidelines for LULUCF activities, preparation of a report on good practice guidance, development of methodologies for the inclusion of degradation and devegetation under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol, and development of methodologies to separate human-induced effects on carbon stocks from indirect human-induced effects, effects due to past practices in forests and natural effects. (See FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.3, decision (-/CP.6) on Land-use, land-use change and forestry, paragraphs 1 and 3.) IPCC: E. Compliance 24. The text on compliance is contained in document FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.6. The basis for this text was the negotiating text that emerged from the first part of the sixth session (see FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3 (vol. IV)). 25. The President’s inter-sessional consultations focused on three issues: the mandates of the enforcement and facilitative branches of the compliance committee, the legally-binding consequences of non-compliance to be applied by the enforcement branch, and the basis of adoption of the compliance regime. 26. The consolidated negotiating text is ed as a formal agreement supplementing the Kyoto Protocol and includes, inter alia, the following proposals: (a) The legally-binding consequences of non-compliance to be applied by the enforcement branch are directed to secure compliance as soon as possible, in order to ensure that the overall objective of the Kyoto Protocol is achieved. These consequences include deduction from the assigned amount of the subsequent commitment period of a number of tonnes in accordance with a stepped rate that increases with the amount of non-compliance, a requirement to submit for review and assessment a compliance action plan to meet commitments, and the suspension of eligibility under Article 17 of the Kyoto Protocol (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.6, decision on Procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance, annex, Article 14); (b) The consideration of compliance with commitments is clearly assigned to either the enforcement branch or to the facilitative branch. The scope for the enforcement branch is limited (Articles 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, 7.1 and 7.4 of the Kyoto Protocol, as well as eligibility requirements under Articles 6, 12 and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol). There is no procedure for appeals. However, in the case of the enforcement branch, preliminary findings will be communicated to Parties, with an opportunity to comment, before a final decision is adopted (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.6, decision on Procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance, annex, Articles 5 and 9). 27. Inorder to ensure a fair and equitable system, it is also proposed that the commitments for Annex I Parties for the second commitment period should be adopted before 2008 (see FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.6, decision on Matters relating to commitments for the second commitment period, paragraph 1(b)). F. Governance of new bodies 28. The President’s inter-sessional consultations confirmed that views continue to differ on the question of how the new bodies being established should be composed and governed. The following compromise proposal is therefore reflected in the relevant decisions: (a) All new bodies® would have the same 10-member composition based on equal representation of the five United Nations regional groups, taking into account interest groups as reflected by the current practice in the UNFCCC Bureau, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities: One member from each of the five United Nations regional groups, plus one member representing the small island developing States; (1) Two other members from Parties included in Annex I; (i) Two other members from Parties not included in Annex 1. (iii) The principle of rotation would govern membership and chairmanship; (b) () For bodies established under the Kyoto Protocol, members to be elected by the COP/MOP from amongst Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. 29. Decisions will be taken by consensus or, failing that, by a three-quarters majority in all bodies except in the enforcement branch of the compliance committee where, in addition, a majority of Parties included in Annex I and a majority of Parties not included in Annex I will be required. 30. Guidance to the bodies will be provided by the COP or the COP/MOP and will be of a general nature rather than for individual cases. 31. All new bodies will be serviced by the UNFCCC secretariat, except for the adaptation fund council. Pursuant to Article 3.9 of the Kyoto Protocol, the consideration of such commitments shall be initiated at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period. compliance committee enforcement branch, intergovernmental consultative group of scientific and technical experts on technology transfer.",06/18/2001,2001_446723,Germany,"* Document FCCC/CP/2001/2 and Corr.1 are withdrawn and replaced by FCCC/CP/2001/2/Rev.1. 24 - 27 28 -31 29 ¢¢ 29 ¢¢ 5 CDM executive board, Article 6 supervisory committee, adaptation fund council, compliance committee facilitative branch,",yes

FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 5 meaningful and effective actions contained in the annex to this decision, and to report on its findings to the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice at its sixteenth session; (b) To facilitate the implementation of the annexed framework in cooperation with the Parties, the Global Environment Facility and other relevant international organizations. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 6 ANNEX Development and transfer of technologies Framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of Article 4, paragraph 5, of the Convention Purpose 1. The purpose of this framework is to develop meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention by increasing and improving the transfer of and access to environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) and know-how. Overall approach 2. The successful development of ESTs and know-how requires a country-driven, integrated approach, at a national and sectoral level. This should involve cooperation among various stakeholders (the private sector, governments, the donor community, bilateral and multilateral institutions, non-governmental organizations and academic and research institutions), including activities on technology needs assessments, technology information, enabling environments, capacity-building and mechanisms for technology transfer. 3. The recommended themes and areas for meaningful and effective actions below are meant to cover all programmes and activities undertaken with a view to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention, encompassing both mitigation and adaptation technologies. Key themes and areas for meaningful and effective actions 1. Technology needs and needs assessments Definition 4. Technology needs and needs assessments are a set of country-driven activities that identify and determine the mitigation and adaptation technology priorities of developing country Parties and Parties included in Annex I but not included in Annex II. They involve different stakeholders in a consultative process to identify the barriers to technology transfer and measures to address these barriers through sectoral analyses. These activities may address soft and hard technologies, such as mitigation and adaptation technologies, identifying regulatory options, developing fiscal and financial incentives and capacity-building. Purpose 5. The purpose of technology needs assessments is to assist Parties in identifying and analysing priority technology needs, which can be the basis for a portfolio of mitigation and adaptation projects and programmes. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 7 Implementation 6. Developing country Parties and Parties included in Annex I but not included in Annex II are encouraged to undertake assessments of country-specific technology needs, subject to the provision of resources, as appropriate to country-specific circumstances, by developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II. Other organizations in a position to do so may also assist in facilitating the technology needs assessment process. Parties are encouraged to make available information on the results of their needs assessments in their national communications, and other related national reports and channels (e.g. technology information clearing house) for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) on a regular basis. 7. Developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II to the Convention are urged to facilitate and support the needs assessments process, recognizing the special circumstances of least developed countries. 8. The Chairman of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, with the assistance of the secretariat, is requested to organize a meeting with representatives from governments, experts drawn from the UNFCCC roster of experts, and representatives from relevant international organizations to identify methodologies needed to undertake technology needs assessments, and to report on its findings to the SBSTA at its sixteenth session. 2. Technology information Definition 9. The technology information component of the framework defines the means, including hardware, software and networking, to facilitate the flow of information between the different stakeholders to enhance the development and transfer of ESTs. This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters, economic and environmental aspects of ESTs, and the identified technology needs of developing country Parties and Parties included in Annex I but not included in Annex II, as well as the availability of ESTs from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer. Purpose 10. The technology information component serves to establish an efficient information system in support of technology transfer and to improve the quality, generation, flow of, and access to, technical, economic, environmental and regulatory information relating to the development and transfer of ESTs under the Convention. Implementation The Convention secretariat is requested: 11. (a) To accelerate its work on the development of an international technology transfer inventory/information clearing house by coordinating with Parties, relevant United Nations FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 8 agencies, and other international organizations and institutions to develop options for further implementation of the clearing house and enhancement of existing technology information centres and networks. Reports on the options and recommendations should be provided to the SBSTA at its subsequent sessions; (b) To seek to cooperate with the Climate Technology Initiative, infer alia, in the possible development of a new search engine to access existing databases of environmentally sound technologies, organize experts meetings on technology information, for example, on detailed user needs, identify gaps in existing EST inventories, update and develop inventories and facilitate sharing of experience on success stories related to technology transfer; (c) To establish a network of technology information centres before the eighth session of the Conference of the Parties, taking into consideration the conclusion of the SBSTA on this matter. 3. Enabling environments Definition 12. The enabling environments component of the framework focuses on the government actions, such as fair trade policies, removal of technical, legal and administrative barriers to technology transfer, sound economic policy, regulatory frameworks, and transparency that create an environment conducive to private and public sector technology transfer. Purpose 13. The purpose of the enabling environments component of the framework is to improve the effectiveness of the transfer of mitigation and adaptation technologies by identifying and analysing ways to facilitate transfer of ESTs, including identification and removal of barriers at each stage of the process. Implementation The following are means of creating enabling environments for technology transfer: 14. (a) All Parties, particularly developed country Parties, are urged to improve, as appropriate, the enabling environment, for transfer of ESTs through identification and removal of barriers, including, inter alia, strengthening environmental regulatory frameworks, enhancing legal systems, ensuring fair trade policies, utilizing tax preferences, protecting intellectual property rights, and improving the access to publicly funded technologies, and other programmes to expand commercial and public technology transfer to developing countries; (b) All Parties are urged to explore, as appropriate, opportunities to provide positive incentives, such as preferential government procurement, transparent and efficient approval procedures for technology transfer projects, and improvement of possible benchmarks, standards, and labelling, which support the development and diffusion of ESTs; FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 9 (c) All Parties are urged to promote joint research and development programmes, as appropriate, both bilaterally and multilaterally; (d) Developed country Parties are encouraged to further promote and implement facilitative measures, for example, export credit programmes and tax preferences, and regulations, as appropriate, to promote transfer of ESTs; (e) All Parties, particularly developed country Parties, are encouraged to integrate, as appropriate, the objective of technology transfer to developing countries into their national policies, including environmental and research and development policies and programmes; (H) Developed country Parties are encouraged to promote, as appropriate, the transfer of publicly owned technologies. 4. Capacity-building Definition 15. Within the context of enhancing the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention, capacity-building is a process that seeks to build, develop, strengthen, enhance and improve existing scientific and technical skills, capabilities and institutions in developing country Parties and Parties included in Annex I but not included in Annex II to assess, adapt, manage and develop ESTs. 16. Capacity-building must be country-driven, addressing specific needs and conditions of developing countries and reflecting their national sustainable development strategies, priorities and initiatives. It is primarily to be undertaken by and in developing countries in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. Purpose 17. The purpose of capacity-building under this framework is to strengthen the capacities of developing country Parties and Parties included in Annex I but not included in Annex II to promote the widespread dissemination, application and development of environmentally sound technologies and know-how to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention. Capacity-building under this framework should be guided by principles established in decision -/CP.6 on capacity-building. Scope 18. The following is the initial list of needs for capacity-building of developing country Parties and Parties included in Annex I but not included in Annex 11, for the transfer of, and access to, ESTs and know-how: (a) Implementation of regional, subregional and/or national capacity-building activities related to the transfer and development of technologies; FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 10 (b) Enhancing the awareness of financial institutions, public, private and international, of the need to evaluate ESTs on an equal footing with other technology options; Training on the use of ESTs through demonstration projects; (c) (d) Enhancement of skills for the adoption, adaptation, installation, operation and maintenance of specific ESTs and methodologies for evaluating alternative technological options; (e) Capacity-building of existing national and regional institutions relevant to technology transfer, taking into account country- and sector-specific circumstances, including South-South cooperation and collaboration; 3] Training on project development, management and operation of climate technologies; (2) Development and implementation of standards and regulations that promote the use, transfer of, and access to ESTs, taking cognizance of country-specific policies, programmes and circumstances; (h) Development of skills and know-how in conducting technology needs assessments; (1) Improvement of knowledge on energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy technologies. 19. The following is the initial list of needs for capacity-building for the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies in developing countries. These shall be country-driven processes supported by developed country Parties. (a) Strengthening existing and, where needed, establishing relevant organizations and institutions in developing countries; (b) Strengthening existing and, where needed, establishing expert exchange, scholarship and cooperative research programmes in relevant national and regional institutions in developing countries for the transfer, operation, maintenance, adaptation, diffusion and development of ESTs; Capacity-building to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change; (c) (d) Strengthening the endogenous capacities and capabilities in research, development, technological innovation, adoption and adaptation of ESTs and technology for systematic observation relevant to climate change and its associated adverse effects; (e) Improvement of knowledge in energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy technologies. Implementation In implementing the capacity-building activities, developed country Parties should: 20. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 11 (a) Make available resources to assist developing countries in the implementation of the capacity-building to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 taking into account the lists contained in paragraphs 18 and 19 above. These resources should include additional financial and technical resources to enable developing countries to undertake country-level needs assessments, and to develop specific capacity-building activities consistent with enhancing implementation of Article 4.5; (b) Respond to the capacity-building needs and priorities of developing countries in a coordinated and timely manner, and support activities implemented at the national and, as appropriate, subregional and regional levels; (c) Give particular attention to the needs of least developed countries and small island developing States amongst them. 21. All Parties should improve the coordination and effectiveness of capacity-building activities related to the development and transfer of technologies. All Parties should promote conditions conducive to the sustainability and effectiveness of these capacity-building activities. 5. Mechanisms for technology transfer Definition 22. The mechanisms for technology transfer, as identified in this section, are to facilitate support of institutional and methodological activities: (i) to enhance the coordination of the full range of stakeholders in different countries and regions and (ii) to engage them in cooperative efforts to accelerate the development and diffusion, including transfer, of environmentally sound technologies, know-how and practices to and between developing country Parties and Parties included in Annex I but not included in Annex II through technology cooperation and partnerships (public/public, private/public and private/private) and (iii) to facilitate development of projects and programmes that support such ends. Purpose 23. The purpose of the proposed mechanisms is to address barriers to technology transfer, information needs and progress on technology transfer to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention.

Purposes 1. This framework for capacity-building in developing countries sets out the scope and provides the basis for action on capacity-building related to the implementation of the Convention and preparation for the effective participation of developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol process that will in a coordinated manner assist them in promoting sustainable development while meeting the objective of the Convention. It should serve as a guide for the Global Environment Facility as an operating entity of the financial mechanism and be considered by multilateral and bilateral organizations in their capacity-building activities related to the implementation of the Convention and preparation for their effective participation in the Kyoto Protocol process. B. Guiding principles and approaches 2. This framework for capacity-building in developing countries is guided and informed by, inter alia, Article 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.7, in the context of Article 3, and Articles 5, 6 and 11.1 of the Convention, and relevant provisions contained in decisions 11/CP.1, 10/CP.2, 11/CP.2, 9/CP.3,2/CP.4,4/CP.4,5/CP.4,6/CP.4,7/CP.4, 12/CP.4, 14/CP.4, and 10/CP.5, and takes into account Articles 10 (c), 10 (d), 10 (e), and 11 of the Kyoto Protocol. 3. Capacity-building activities related to the implementation of the Convention by developing countries and to the preparation for their effective participation in the Kyoto Protocol process should build on work already undertaken by developing countries, as well as on the work undertaken with support from multilateral and bilateral organizations. 4. The capacity-building needs already identified in the various decisions of the Conference of the Parties should continue to be comprehensively and promptly addressed to promote sustainable development in developing countries through the effective implementation of the Convention and preparation for their effective participation in the Kyoto Protocol process. 5. There is no “one size fits all” formula for capacity-building. Capacity-building must be country-driven, addressing the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and reflecting their national sustainable development strategies, priorities and initiatives. It is primarily to be undertaken by and in developing countries in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 6. Capacity-building is a continuous, progressive and iterative process, the implementation of which should be based on the priorities of developing countries. 7. Capacity-building activities should be undertaken in an effective, efficient, integrated and programmatic manner, taking into consideration the specific national circumstances of developing countries. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 17 8. Capacity-building activities undertaken within this framework should maximize synergies between the Convention and other global environmental agreements, as appropriate. 9. Capacity-building is crucial to developing countries, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. The special circumstances of least developed countries and small island developing States need to be taken into account in the implementation of this framework. They include: Fragile ecosystems; (a) High population pressure and isolated geographical locations; (b) Weak economies, low incomes, high levels of poverty and a lack of foreign (c) investment; Land degradation, desertification; (d) (e) Undeveloped services, inter alia, meteorological and hydrological services and water resources management; Lack of early warning systems for natural disaster management; Inadequate food security. (2 10. Capacity-building involves “learning by doing”. Demonstration projects may be used in identifying and learning about the specific capacities that need to be further developed in developing countries. 11. Existing national institutions have an important role to play in supporting capacity-building activities in developing countries. Such centres can incorporate traditional skills, knowledge and practices, to provide appropriate services in developing countries and facilitate information sharing. Whenever possible and effective, therefore, capacity-building should mobilize these existing national, subregional and regional institutions and the private sector in developing countries and build on existing processes and endogenous capacities. 12. National coordinating mechanisms and focal points and national coordinating entities have an important role to play in ensuring coordination at the country and regional levels and may serve as the focal point for coordinating capacity-building activities. 13. Multilateral and bilateral bodies are encouraged to take account of this framework in their consultations with developing countries when supporting capacity-building activities related to the implementation of the Convention and the preparation for effective participation by developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol process. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 18 C. Objective and scope of capacity-building Objective 14. Capacity-building should assist developing countries to build, develop, strengthen, enhance, and improve their capabilities to achieve the objective of the Convention through the implementation of the provisions of the Convention and the preparation for their effective participation in the Kyoto Protocol process. Scope 15. The following is the initial scope of needs and areas for capacity-building in developing countries as broadly identified in the annex to decision 10/CP.5, in the compilation and synthesis document prepared by the secretariat® and in submissions by Parties:’ (a) Institutional capacity-building, including the strengthening or establishment, as appropriate, of national climate change secretariats or national focal points; Enhancement and/or creation of an enabling environment; (b) National communications; (c) National climate change programmes; (d) (e) Greenhouse gas inventories, emission database management, and systems for collecting, managing and utilizing activity data and emission factors; Vulnerability and adaptation assessment; Capacity-building for implementation of adaptation measures; (2 Assessment for implementation of mitigation options; (h) (1) Research and systematic observation, including meteorological, hydrological and climatological services; Development and transfer of technology; W) (k) Improved decision-making, including assistance for participation in international negotiations; Clean development mechanism; @ Needs arising out of the implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention; (m) Education, training and public awareness; (n) Information and networking, including the establishment of databases. (0) > FCCC/SB/2000/INF.1. > FCCC/SB/2000/INF.5. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 19 16. Other capacity-building needs and possible responses are being identified by the Parties in their discussions of other issues. The decisions resulting from these discussions, as well as other activities related to the implementation of the Convention and preparation for their effective participation in the Kyoto Protocol process, should continue to inform the scope and implementation of this framework. Specific scope for capacity-building in least developed countries 17. The least developed countries, and small island developing States amongst them, are among the most vulnerable to extreme weather events and the adverse effects of climate change. They also have the least capacity to cope with and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. The following is the initial assessment of needs and priority areas for capacity-building in these countries: (a) Strengthening existing and, where needed, establishing national climate change secretariats or focal points to enable the effective implementation of the Convention and effective participation in the Kyoto Protocol process, including preparation of national communications; (b) Developing an integrated implementation programme which takes into account the role of research and training in capacity-building; (c) Developing and enhancing technical capacities and skills to carry out and effectively integrate vulnerability and adaptation assessments into sustainable development programmes and develop national adaptation programmes of action; (d) Strengthening existing and, where needed, establishing national research and training institutions in order to ensure the sustainability of the capacity-building programmes; (e) Strengthening the capacity of meteorological and hydrological services to collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate weather and climate information to support implementation of national adaptation programmes of action; 3] Enhancing public awareness (level of understanding and human capacity development). D. Implementation Actions to enhance the implementation of this framework, taking into account the initial scope outlined in paragraphs 15 to 17 18. All Parties should improve the coordination and effectiveness of capacity-building efforts through dialogue between and among Parties included in Annex II, developing country Parties, and bilateral and multilateral institutions. All Parties should support the operation of this framework and promote conditions conducive to the sustainability and effectiveness of capacity- building activities. In implementing this framework, developing country Parties should: 19. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 20 (a) Continue to identify their specific needs, options and priorities for capacity-building on a country-driven basis, taking into account existing capacities and past and current activities; (b) Promote South-South cooperation by utilizing the services of institutions in developing countries that can support capacity-building activities at the national, subregional and regional levels, wherever possible and effective; (c) Promote the participation of a wide range of stakeholders, including governments at all levels, national and international organizations, civil society and the private sector, as appropriate; (d) Promote the coordination and sustainability of activities undertaken within this framework, including the efforts of national coordinating mechanisms, focal points, and national coordinating entities; (e) Facilitate the dissemination and sharing of information on capacity-building activities conducted by developing countries for better coordination and South-South cooperation. In implementing this framework, Parties included in Annex II should: 20. (a) Provide additional financial and technical resources to assist developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States amongst them, in the implementation of this framework, including promptly available financial and technical resources to enable them to undertake country-level needs assessments and to develop specific capacity-building activities consistent with this framework; (b) Respond to the capacity-building needs and priorities of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States amongst them, in a coordinated and timely manner, and support activities implemented at the national and, as appropriate, subregional and regional levels; (c) Give particular attention to the needs of least developed countries and small island developing States amongst them. Financing and operation 21. Financial and technical resources should be made available, through an operating entity of the financial mechanism and, as appropriate, multilateral and bilateral agencies and the private sector, to assist developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States amongst them, in the implementation of this framework. 22. Inresponse to this framework, the operating entity of the financial mechanism should elaborate a country-driven strategy for its capacity-building activities. 23. Multilateral and bilateral agencies are encouraged to take constructive action to support capacity-building activities in this framework through streamlined and coordinated approaches and in a timely manner. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 21 24. Financial and other assistance is to be made available to developing countries, in particular to the least developed countries and small island developing States amongst them, to enable them to continue to determine, assess and prioritize their needs for capacity-building in a simple, timely manner and to assist them in strengthening existing institutions and, when needed, to establish the institutional arrangements to implement effective capacity-building activities. 25. The capacity-building activities undertaken within this framework are to be country-driven and implemented primarily at the country level. 26. In order to facilitate the exchange of information and cooperation, developing countries, in collaboration with relevant institutions, should identify regional, subregional and sectoral activities that can effectively and efficiently address common capacity-building needs. 27. The results of activities conducted by the Global Environment Facility as a multilateral financial institution, including the Capacity Development Initiative, as well as activities undertaken by multilateral, bilateral and private sector entities, may be considered in further developing capacity-building activities within this framework at the regional and subregional levels. Time-frame 28. This framework for capacity-building should be implemented promptly, taking into account the immediate, medium- and long-term priority needs identified by developing countries. 29. Developing countries which have already identified their capacity-building priorities through ongoing work aimed at the implementation of the Convention, should be able to promptly implement capacity-building activities under this framework. 30. The immediate priority needs of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States amongst them, should be addressed urgently in the implementation of this framework. Review of progress 31. The Conference of the Parties, through the Subsidiary Body for Implementation, shall regularly monitor and review the progress in the implementation of this framework. 32. The Global Environment Facility, as the operating entity of the financial mechanism, is requested to report on its progress in support of the implementation of this framework in its reports to the Conference of the Parties. Role of the secretariat 33. Inaccordance with this framework for capacity-building, the secretariat is requested, consistent with Article 8 of the Convention, to undertake the following tasks: FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 22 (a) To cooperate with the operating entity of the financial mechanism, its implementing agencies and other entities for capacity-building to facilitate the implementation of this framework; (b) To collect, process, compile and disseminate the information needed by the Conference of the Parties or its subsidiary bodies to review the progress in the implementation of this framework for capacity-building.

Recommends that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session, adopt a decision endorsing a framework for capacity-building under the Convention that parallels the framework contained in the annex below, with additional reference to priority areas for capacity-building relating to implementation of the Kyoto Protocol; Requests the secretariat, consistent with Article 8 of the Convention: (a) To cooperate with multilateral and bilateral institutions to facilitate the implementation of this framework; (b) To collect, process, compile and disseminate the information needed by the Conference of the Parties and the subsidiary bodies to monitor progress in the implementation of this framework. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 25 ANNEX Framework for capacity-building in countries with economies in transition A. Purpose 1. The purpose of this framework for capacity-building is to set out the scope and basis for action for capacity-building activities in countries with economies in transition (EIT Parties) under the Convention and for the preparation of EIT Parties for their participation in the Kyoto Protocol when it enters into force. B. Guiding principles and approaches 2. This framework for capacity-building in EIT Parties is guided and informed by, inter alia, Articles 4.1, 4.2,4.5 and 4.6, 5, 6 and 12 of the Convention and relevant provisions contained in decisions 9/CP.2, 6/CP.4, 7/CP.4 and 11/CP.5 and takes account of Articles 2, 3, 5,6, 7and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol. 3. As Parties included in Annex I, EIT Parties have quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments that impose challenges to their existing capacities to implement the Convention. As Parties undergoing the process of transition to a market economy, they need to enhance their ability to address climate change issues. Capacity-building is therefore critical to the effective implementation by EIT Parties of their commitments under the Convention and the preparation of EIT Parties for their participation in the Kyoto Protocol when it enters into force. 4. Capacity-building for EIT Parties must be country-driven, consistent with their national sustainable development strategies, reflect their national initiatives and priorities, respond to needs determined and prioritized by EIT Parties themselves and be primarily undertaken by and in EIT Parties in partnership with other Parties and relevant organizations, as appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 5. Capacity-building should contribute to the effective implementation of the Convention by EIT Parties and the preparation of EIT Parties for their participation in the Kyoto Protocol when it enters into force. 6. Capacity-building efforts are more effective when they take place within an enabling environment conducive to the development of human, institutional and technical capacity. 7. Capacity-building should be results-oriented and implemented in an integrated and programmatic manner to facilitate its monitoring and evaluation, cost-effectiveness and efficiency. 8. Capacity-building is a continuous process aimed at strengthening or establishing, as appropriate, relevant institutions, organizational structures, and human resources in order to strengthen expertise relevant to paragraph 3 of this framework. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 26 9. Capacities should be developed and strengthened in a manner and under conditions that will work towards sustainability and support the short- and long-term objectives and priorities of EIT Parties under the Convention. 10. Capacity-building involves “learning by doing”. Capacity-building activities should be designed and implemented in a flexible manner. 11. Capacity-building should improve the coordination and effectiveness of existing efforts and promote the participation of and dialogue between a wide range of actors and constituencies, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society and the private sector. 12. Wherever possible, capacity-building should utilize existing institutions and bodies and build on existing processes and endogenous capacities. 13. National focal points and other institutions such as research centres and universities and other relevant organizations should play an important role in providing capacity-building services and facilitating the flow of knowledge, best practices and information. 14. Capacity-building should be designed so that it results in the development, strengthening and enhancement of institutional capacities, human resources, knowledge and information, methodologies and practices, and the participation and networking of EIT Parties to promote sustainable development and for the purpose set out in paragraph 1 of this framework. 15. Capacity-building in support of achieving the objectives of the Convention should maximize synergies between the Convention and other global environmental agreements, as appropriate. 16. Capacity-building is more effective when it is coordinated at all levels (national, regional and international) through dialogue between and among Parties included in Annex I, and when past and existing efforts are taken into account. C. Objective and scope of capacity-building Objective 17. The objective of capacity-building is to build the capacity of EIT Parties to enable them to effectively implement the objective of the Convention and to prepare for their participation in the Kyoto Protocol when it enters into force. Scope 18. To ensure that capacity-building efforts are country-driven, each EIT Party should, within the scope for capacity-building, determine its specific objectives, needs, priorities and options to implement the Convention and to prepare for its participation in the Kyoto Protocol when it enters into force, consistent with its national sustainable development strategy, taking into account existing capacities and past and current activities undertaken by the country itself and in partnership with bilateral and multilateral institutions and the private sector. FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.1 English Page 27 19. The needs for capacity-building in EIT Parties were first identified in the compilation and synthesis document prepared by the secretariat (FCCC/SB/2000/INF.2) based on the submissions of EIT Parties (FCCC/SB/2000/INF.7). The general areas and needs for capacity-building are listed below. This scope for capacity-building may be revised as further information is made available and as needs and priorities are further identified. 20. General priority areas for capacity-building identified by EIT Parties related to the implementation of the Convention, which may also be relevant to their preparation for participation in the Kyoto Protocol, are to be identified in their national action plan for capacity-building, and include: National greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories; (a) Projections of GHG emissions; (b) Policies and measures, and the estimation of their effects; (c) Impact assessment and adaptation; (d) Research and systematic observation; (e) Education, training and public awareness; Transfer of environmentally sound technologies; (2 National communications and national climate action plans; (h) National systems for estimation of GHG emissions; @ Modalities for accounting relating to targets, timetables and national registries; W) Reporting obligations; (k) Joint implementation projects and emissions trading. @ 21. In order to maximize available resources for capacity-building and to facilitate exchange and cooperation among EIT Parties, multilateral and bilateral agencies in consultation with EIT Parties should assist, as appropriate, the efforts of EIT Parties themselves to identify, develop and implement national, regional, subregional and sectoral activities that meet the capacity-building needs of EIT Parties. The results of the current and next phase of the Capacity Development Initiative of the Global Environment Facility could provide valuable inputs for these activities. D.

Parties not included in Annex I which are Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; (a) (b) Parties included in Annex I that do not meet the participation requirements in paragraph 30 or have been suspended. G. Validation and registration 33. Validation is the process of independent evaluation of a project activity by a designated operational entity against the requirements of the CDM as set out in decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and this annex, on the basis of the project design document, as outlined in Appendix B below. 34. Registration is the formal acceptance by the executive board of a validated project as a CDM project activity. Registration is the prerequisite for the verification, certification and issuance of CERs related to that project activity. 35. The designated operational entity selected by project participants to validate a project activity, being under a contractual arrangement with them, shall review the project design document and any supporting documentation to confirm that the following requirements are met: The participation requirements as set out in paragraphs 27 to 29 are satisfied; (a) Comments by stakeholders have been considered; (b) The project activity has undergone an appropriate environmental impact (©) assessment; (d) The project activity is expected to result in a reduction in anthropogenic emissions by sources or an enhancement in anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases from eligible CDM project activities, as determined in accordance with decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP, that are additional to any that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity, in accordance with paragraphs 41 to 50; (e) The baseline methodology and monitoring plan comply with requirements pertaining to: Methodologies previously approved by the executive board; or @ Modalities and procedures for establishing a new methodology; (i) 63) Provisions for monitoring, verification and reporting are in accordance with decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and this annex; (2) The project activity conforms to all other requirements for CDM project activities in decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and this annex, and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP and by the executive board. 36. If the designated operational entity determines that the project activity intends to use a new methodology, as referred to in paragraph 35 (e) (ii), it shall, prior to a submission for registration of this project activity, forward the proposed methodology to the executive board for review. The executive board shall expeditiously, if possible within three months, review a proposed new methodology. Whenever the executive board approves such a methodology, it shall make it publicly available along with any relevant guidance. Once such a methodology has been approved by the executive board, the designated operational entity may proceed with the validation of the project activity. 37. A revision of a methodology shall be carried out in accordance with procedures for approving new baselines and monitoring plans. Any revision to an approved methodology shall only be applicable to baselines and monitoring plans registered subsequent to the date of revision and shall not affect existing registered projects activities during their crediting periods. The designated operational entity shall: 38. (a) In accordance with provisions on confidentiality contained in paragraph 26 (h), make publicly available the project design document; (b) Receive, within 30 days, comments from Parties and UNFCCC accredited non-governmental organizations and make them publicly available; (©) After the deadline for receipt of comments, make a determination as to whether, on the basis of the information provided and taking into account the comments received, the project activity should be validated; (d) Inform project participants if it determines that the project design, as documented, does not fulfil the requirements for validation, and explain the reasons for non- acceptance; (e) Prior to the submission of the validation report to the executive board, have received from the project participants a formal letter of approval from the designated national authority of the host Party, including confirmation that the project activity assists the host Party in achieving sustainable development; 63) Submit to the executive board, if it determines the proposed project activity to be valid, a request for registration including the validated project design document and an explanation how it has taken due account of comments received. The request for registration shall be made in the form of a validation report; Make this validation report publicly available. (2 39. The registration by the executive board shall be deemed final 30 days after the date of receipt by the executive board of the request for registration, unless a Party involved in the project activity, or at least one fourth of the members of the executive board request a review of the proposed CDM project activity. Such a review shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Be related to issues associated with the applicability of the baseline methodology to the project activity, the adequacy of the monitoring plan, transboundary environmental and social impacts; (b) Be finalized no later than at the second meeting following the request for review, with the result and the reasons being communicated to the project participants and the public. 40. A proposed project activity that is not accepted may be reconsidered for validation and subsequent registration, after appropriate revisions, provided that it follows procedures and meets requirements for validation and registration, including those related to public comments. 41. A CDM project activity is additional if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by sources are reduced below, or anthropogenic removals of greenhouse gases by sinks are increased beyond, those that would have occurred in the absence of the registered CDM project activity, from eligible CDM project activities, as determined by decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP. Project participants shall address whether similar projects are being implemented which would meet the technological and investment needs pursuant to the sustainable development priorities of the host Party. 42. The baseline for a CDM project activity is the scenario that reasonably represents the anthropogenic emissions by sources or anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity. A baseline shall cover emissions from all gases, sectors and source categories listed in Annex A and anthropogenic removals by sinks within the project boundary. A baseline shall be deemed to reasonably represent the anthropogenic emissions by sources or anthropogenic removals by sinks that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity if it is derived using a baseline methodology referred to in paragraphs 35 and 36. A baseline shall be established: 43. (a) By project participants in accordance with provisions for the use of approved and new methodologies, contained in decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and this annex; (b) In a transparent manner regarding the choice of approaches, assumptions, methodologies, parameters, data sources, key factors and additionality; On a project-specific basis; (©) (d) In accordance with standardized procedures, developed by the executive board, for small-scale CDM project activities meeting the criteria specified in decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP; (e) Taking into account relevant national and/or sectoral policies and circumstances, such as sectoral reform initiatives, local fuel availability, power sector expansion plans, and the economic situation in the project sector. 44. The baseline may include a scenario where future anthropogenic emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels, due to the specific circumstances of the host Party. 45. The baseline shall be defined in a way that CERs cannot be earned for decreases in activity levels due to force majeure. 46. In choosing a baseline methodology for a project activity, project participants shall select from among the following approaches the one deemed most appropriate for the project activity, taking into account any guidance by the executive board, and justify their choice: Existing actual or historical emissions, as applicable; or (a) (b) Emissions from a technology that represents an economically attractive course of action, taking into account barriers to investment; or (c) The average emission or removal rates of similar projects activities undertaken in the previous five years, in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances, and whose performance is among the top 20 percent of their category. 47. The crediting period of a CDM project activity shall be limited to five years, except for small-scale CDM project activities meeting the criteria specified in decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) for which it may extend for up to ten years. The crediting period may be renewed by the project participants, provided that a designated operational entity determines and informs the executive board that the project activity continues to satisfy the original baseline criteria. 48. Reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks shall be adjusted for leakage in accordance with the monitoring and verification provisions in paragraphs 57 and 60 (e) respectively. 49. Leakage is defined as the net change of anthropogenic emissions by sources or anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases which occurs outside the project boundary, and that is measurable and attributable to the CDM project activity. 50. The project boundary shall encompass all anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases under the control of the project participants that are significant and reasonably attributable to the CDM project activity. H. Monitoring 51. Project participants shall include, as part of the project design document, a monitoring plan that provides for: (a) The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for estimating or measuring anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases occurring within the project boundary during the crediting period; (b) The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for determining the baseline of anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases within the project boundary during the crediting period; (c) The identification of all potential sources of, and the collection and archiving of data on, increased anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or reduced anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases outside the project boundary that are significant and reasonably attributable to the project activity during the crediting period; (d) The collection and archiving of information relevant to the assessment of environmental impacts; Quality assurance and control procedures for the monitoring process; (e) ) Procedures for the periodic calculation of the reductions of anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks by the proposed CDM project activity, and for leakage effects; (2) Documentation of all steps involved in the calculations referred to in subparagraphs (c) and (f) above. 52. A monitoring plan for a proposed project activity shall be based on a previously approved monitoring methodology or a new methodology, in accordance with paragraphs 35 and 36 above that: (a) Is determined by the designated operational entity as appropriate to the circumstances of the proposed project activity and has been successfully applied elsewhere; (b) Reflects good monitoring practice, i.e. its performance is at least equivalent to the most cost-effective, commercially applied monitoring methodologies appropriate to the circumstances. 53. For small-scale CDM project activities meeting the criteria specified in decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP, project participants may use simplified monitoring methodologies approved by the executive board in accordance with paragraphs 35 and 36. 54. Project participants shall implement the monitoring plan contained in the registered project design document. 55. Revisions to the monitoring plan, in accordance with paragraph 37, require justification by project participants that the revisions improve the accuracy and/or completeness of information. 56. The implementation of the registered monitoring plan and its approved revisions, as applicable, shall be a condition for verification, certification and the issuance of CERs. 57. Subsequent to the monitoring and reporting of reductions in anthropogenic emissions and/or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks, CERs of a CDM project activity during a given period shall be calculated, applying the registered methodology, in the following manner, as applicable: (a) Baseline emissions less the actual anthropogenic emissions by sources adjusted for leakage; (b) Actual anthropogenic removals by sinks less baseline removals by sinks adjusted for leakage. 58. The project participants shall provide to the designated operational entity, contracted by the project participants to perform the verification, a monitoring report in accordance with the registered monitoring plan set out in paragraph 51. 1. Verification and certification 59. Verification is the periodic independent review and ex post determination by the designated operational entity of the monitored reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or the monitored enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that have occurred as a result of a registered CDM project activity during the verification period. Certification is the written assurance by the designated operational entity that, during a specified time period, a project activity achieved the reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases as verified. 60. In accordance with the provisions on confidentiality in paragraph 26 (h), the designated operational entity contracted by the project participants to perform the verification shall make the monitoring report publicly available and: (a) Determine whether the project documentation provided is in accordance with the requirements of the registered project design document and relevant provisions of decision -/CP.6 (Article 12) and this annex; (b) Conduct on-site inspections, as appropriate, which shall comprise, inter alia, a review of performance records, interviews with project participants and local stakeholders, and may comprise collection of measurements, observation of established practices and testing of the accuracy of monitoring equipment; If appropriate, use additional data from other sources; (©) (d) Review monitoring results and verify that the monitoring methodologies for the estimation of reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks have been applied correctly and their documentation is complete and transparent; (e) Determine the reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that would not have occurred otherwise, based on the data and information derived under subparagraph (a) and obtained under subparagraphs (b) and/or (c), as appropriate, using calculation procedures consistent with those contained in the registered project design document and in the monitoring plan; 63) Identify and inform the project participants of any concerns related to the conformity of the actual project activity and its operation with the registered project design document. Project participants may address the concerns and supply relevant additional information,; (2) Recommend to the project participants appropriate changes to the monitoring methodology, if necessary; (h) Provide a verification report to the project participants, the Parties involved and the executive board. The report shall be made publicly available. 61. The designated operational entity shall, based on its verification report, certify in writing that, during the specified time period, the project activity achieved the verified amount of reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases that would not have occurred otherwise. It shall inform the project participants, Parties involved and the executive board of its certification decision in writing immediately upon completion of the certification process and make the certification report publicly available. J. Issuance of certified emission reductions 62. The certification report shall constitute a request for issuance to the executive board of CERs equal to the verified amount of reductions of anthropogenic emissions by sources and/or enhancements of anthropogenic removals by sinks of greenhouse gases. 63. The issuance shall be considered final 15 days after the date of receipt of the request for issuance, unless a Party involved in the project activity, or at least one fourth of the members of the executive board request a review of the proposed CDM project activity. Such a review shall be limited to issues of fraud, malfeasance or incompetence of the designated operational entities and be conducted as follows: (a) Upon receipt of a request for such a review, the executive board, at its next meeting, shall decide on its course of action.

Draft decision -/CMP.1 Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, Recalling Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Further recalling decisions 1/CP.3, 2/CP.3, 1/CP.4 and 8/CP.4 of the Conference of the Parties, Having considered decision -/CP.6 adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its sixth session, 1. Endorses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as accepted by the sixteenth session of the IPCC held in Montreal, Canada, 1 to 8 May 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance), as an elaboration of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; ° The organization of the workshops is subject to availability of funds. 2. Decides that the good practice guidance referred to in paragraph 1 shall be used by Parties included in Annex I in their preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories under the Kyoto Protocol; 3. Decides that adjustments referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol shall be applied only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; 4. Decides that the calculation of adjustments shall commence only after a Party has been provided with opportunities to correct any deficiencies in accordance with the time-frame and procedures set forth in the guidelines for inventory review under Article 8; 5. Decides that the adjustment procedure shall result in estimates that are conservative for the Party concerned so as to ensure that anthropogenic emissions are not underestimated and anthropogenic removals by sinks and anthropogenic base year emissions are not overestimated; 6. Emphasizes that adjustments are intended to provide an incentive for Parties to provide complete and accurate annual greenhouse gas inventories prepared in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments are intended to correct inventory problems for the purpose of accounting of the Parties’ emissions inventories and assigned amounts. Adjustments are not intended to substitute for a Party’s obligation to estimate and report greenhouse gas inventories in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; 7. Decides that adjusted estimates shall be calculated in accordance with the technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments contained in the annex to this decision. Such technical guidance shall ensure consistency and comparability and that similar methods are used for similar problems as far as possible across all inventories reviewed under Article 8; 8. Decides that any adjustments applied to the base year inventory estimates of a Party included in Annex I shall be used in the calculation of the Party’s assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, in accordance with the modalities for the accounting of assigned amount under Article 7, paragraph 4, and shall not be replaced by a revised estimate subsequent to the establishment of the Party’s assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and §; 9. Decides that any adjustments applied to the inventory for a year of the commitment period of the Party included in Annex I shall be used in the annual compilation and accounting of emission inventories and assigned amounts; 10. Decides that in the event of a disagreement between the Party and the expert review team regarding the adjustment, the issue will be forwarded to the Compliance Committee; 11. Decides that a Party may submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory of a year of the commitment period to which an adjustment was previously applied, provided that the revised estimate is submitted, at the latest, in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012. Subject to a review under Article 8 and the acceptance of the revised estimate by the expert review team, the revised estimate shall replace the adjusted estimate. In the event of a disagreement between the Party and the expert review team regarding the revised estimate, the issue will be forwarded to the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance.

PART II: REVIEW OF ANNUAL INVENTORIES A. Purpose The purpose of the review of annual inventories of Parties included in Annex I is: 36. (a) To provide an objective, consistent, transparent, thorough and comprehensive technical assessment of annual inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol for conformity with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories™ as elaborated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories™ and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP, and with section I of the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7; > In these guidelines the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are referred to as the IPCC Guidelines. » In these guidelines the IPCC report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance. (b) To assess if adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, may be needed and, if so, to calculate adjustments in accordance with relevant decisions of the COP/MOP relating to Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol; (c) To ensure that the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee have reliable information on the annual inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol of each Party included in Annex L. B. General procedures The review should cover: 37. (a) The annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format (CRF); (b) Supplementary information under Article 7, paragraph 1, incorporated in the Party’s national inventory according to section I.D, greenhouse gas inventory information, of the guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7. The annual inventory review shall consist of two elements: 38. Initial check by the expert review team, with the assistance of the secretariat; (a) Individual inventory review by the expert review team. (b) 39. The individual inventory review shall occur in conjunction with the review of assigned amount, changes in national systems and changes in national registries as set out in part I of these guidelines. 40. The base year inventory shall be reviewed only once prior to the commitment period and adjusted if appropriate. 41. The annual inventory review should be conducted as a desk review. In addition, each Party included in Annex I shall be subject to at least one in-country visit by an expert review team during the commitment period as part of its annual review. 42. In-country visits should be scheduled, planned and take place with the consent of the Party included in Annex I subject to review. 43. Inyears when an in-country visit is not scheduled, an expert review team can request an in-country visit if it believes, based on the findings of the desk review, that such a visit is necessary to allow for fuller investigation of a potential problem that the team has identified, subject to the consent of the Party. The expert review team shall provide a rationale for the additional country visit and shall compile a list of questions and issues to be addressed during the country visit to be sent to the Party in advance of the visit. If such an in-country visit occurs, the expert review team may recommend that a pending scheduled in-country visit is not necessary. 44. In addition, at least once during the commitment period, a special review of all available information on land-use, land-use change and forestry shall occur. 45. If a Party fails to provide to the expert review team the data and information necessary for the assessment of conformity with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP, the expert review team shall assume that the estimate was not prepared in accordance with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP. C. Initial checks of annual inventories Scope of the review 46. The expert review team shall conduct an initial check as a desk review to examine that each Party included in Annex I has submitted a consistent, complete and timely annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the common reporting format and that data contained in the CRF are complete by means of computerized analysis and checks and in the correct format to enable subsequent review stages to occur. The initial check shall identify whether: 47. (a) The submission is complete and information has been provided in the correct format in accordance with reporting guidelines on annual inventories; (b) All sources, sinks and gases included in the IPCC Guidelines and any good practice adopted by the COP/MOP are reported; (c) Any gaps are explained by use of notation keys, such as NE (not estimated) and NA (not applicable), in the CRF and whether there is frequent use of these notation keys; Methodologies are documented with notations in the CRF; (d) (e) Estimates for carbon dioxide (CO,) emissions from fossil fuel combustion are reported using the IPCC reference approach, in addition to estimates derived using national methods; (H) Estimates for hydrofluorocarbon, perfluorocarbon and sulphur hexafluoride emissions are reported by individual chemical species; (2) A Party has failed to submit an annual inventory or the national inventory report or the common reporting format by the due date, or within six weeks of the due date; (h) A Party has failed to include an estimate for a source category (as defined in chapter 7 of the IPCC good practice guidance) that individually accounted for 7 per cent or more of the Party’s aggregate emissions, defined as aggregate submitted emissions of the gases and from the sources listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol*, in the most recent of the Party’s reviewed inventories in which the source was estimated. emissions in 1990, emissions by sources and removals by sinks from land-use change (all emissions by sources minus removals by sinks reported in relation to the conversion of forests (deforestation)). 48. The initial check for each Party included in Annex I shall be performed and a status report shall be completed within [6-x] weeks after the submission due date of the annual inventory and sent to the Party for comment. A delay in the preparation of the status report shall not shorten the time available for the Party to comment on the status report. The secretariat shall immediately notify the Party concerned of any omissions or technical format problems identified in the initial check. 49. Any information, corrections, additional information or comments on the status report received from the Party within six weeks of the submission due date shall be subject to an initial check and shall be covered in the final status report. A delay in the submission of the annual inventory shortens the time available for the Party to comment on the status report. 50. The status report on the initial check for each Party included in Annex I shall be finalized within [6+y] weeks from the submission due date to be used in the individual inventory review. Reporting The status report shall include: 51. The date of receipt of the inventory submission by the secretariat; (a) (b) An indication whether the annual inventory, including the national inventory report and the CRF, has been submitted; (c) An indication whether any source category or gas of a source category is missing and, if so, an indication of the magnitude of the likely emissions of that source category or gas, if possible relative to the last inventory for which the review has been completed; (d) Identification of any inventory problems according to the categories listed in paragraph 51 (f) and (h). D. Individual inventory reviews Scope of the review The expert review team shall, inter alia: 52. (a) Examine application of the requirements of the IPCC Guidelines and the reporting guidelines on annual inventories and relevant decisions of the COP/MOP and identify any departure from these requirements; (b) Examine whether the IPCC good practice guidance and any other good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP was applied and documented, in particular noting the identification of key source categories, selection and use of methodologies and assumptions, » The time-frames referred to as x and y in paragraphs 48 and 50 will be decided according to the decision accompanying these guidelines. For review prior to the commitment period, the time-frames for the initial check may serve as an indication. development and selection of emission factors, collection and selection of activity data, reporting of consistent time-series, reporting of uncertainties related to inventory estimates and methodologies used for estimating those uncertainties and identify any inconsistencies; (c) Compare emission or removal estimates, activity data, implied emission factors and any recalculations with data from previous submissions of the Party to identify any irregularities or inconsistencies; (d) Compare the Party’s activity data with relevant external authoritative sources, if feasible, and identify sources where there are significant differences; (e) Assess the consistency of information in the common reporting format with that in the national inventory report; (H) Assess the extent to which issues and questions raised by expert review teams in previous reports have been addressed and resolved; (2) Recommend possible ways for improving the estimation and the reporting of inventory information. 53. The expert review team may use relevant technical information in the review process, such as information from international organizations. 54.

The expert review team shall identify whether the same key source category as defined in chapter 7 of the IPCC good practice guidance was adjusted in previous reviews and, if so, the team shall indicate the number of reviews that identified and adjusted the problem previously. Timin 29 59. The individual inventory review, including adjustment procedures, shall be concluded within one year of the due date of submission of the information to be reported under Article 7, paragraph 1. emissions in 1990, emissions by sources and removals by sinks from land-use change (all emissions by sources minus removals by sinks reported in relation to the conversion of forests (deforestation)). ¥ The time-frames referred to as a to fin paragraphs 60 to 65 will be decided according to the decision accompanying these guidelines. 60. The expert review team shall list all problems identified, indicating which would need an adjustment, and send this list to the Party no later than [a] weeks from the submission due date of the annual inventory, if the inventory was submitted at least six weeks after the submission due date. 61. The Party shall comment on these questions within [b] weeks and, where requested by the review team, may provide revised estimates. 62. The expert review team shall prepare a individual inventory review report, which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates calculated according to guidance under Article 5, paragraph 2, within [c] weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed and shall send the report to the Party concerned. 63. The Party shall be provided with [d] weeks to comment on the individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether it accepts or rejects the adjustment. 64. The expert review team shall prepare a final individual inventory review report within [e] weeks of the receipt of the comments on the report. 65. If a Party during the above steps is able to comment earlier than in the above given time- frames, the Party may use the time saved to comment on the revised final report. A total of [f] additional weeks to comment may be granted to Parties whose national language is not one of the United Nations official languages. Procedures for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2 66. Adjustments referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol shall be applied only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the COP/MOP. The procedure for the calculation of adjustments shall be as follows: 67. (a) During the individual inventory review, the expert review team shall identify problems to which the criteria in the guidance for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, apply. The expert review team shall officially notify the Party of the reason why an adjustment is considered necessary and provide advice on how the problem could be corrected; (b) The adjustment procedure should only commence after the Party has had opportunities to correct a problem and if the expert review team finds that the Party has not adequately corrected the problem through the provision of an acceptable revised estimate, in accordance with the time-frames set out in paragraphs 60 to 65 above; (c) The expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with any guidance under Article 5, paragraph 2, adopted by the COP/MOP, in consultation with the Party concerned and within the time-frame set out in these guidelines;™ (d) The expert review team shall officially notify the Party concerned of the calculated adjustment(s) within the time-frame set out in these guidelines. This notification shall describe the assumptions, data and methodologies used to calculate the adjustment(s), as well as the value of the adjustment(s); (e) Within the time-frame set out in these guidelines, the Party concerned shall notify the secretariat of its intention to accept or reject the adjustment(s), with its rationale. Failure to respond by this date shall be considered as acceptance of the adjustment(s), as follows: If the Party accepts the adjustment(s), the adjustment(s) shall be applied for the purpose of compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned amounts; (1) If the Party disagrees with the proposed adjustment(s), it should send a notification to the expert review team, including its rationale, and the expert review team should send the notification along with its recommendation in its final report to the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. (i) 68.

LAND USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY Draft decision -/CP.7"" Land use, land-use change and forestry The Conference of the Parties, Recalling its decisions 1/CP.4, 8/CP.4, 9/CP.4 and 16/CP.5, Acknowledging with appreciation the scientific advice provided in the Special Report on Land use, Land-use Change and Forestry prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 1. Recommends that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session adopt decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry); Requests the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA): (a) To consider, following the completion of the methodological work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as outlined in paragraph 3 (c¢) below, and adopt methodologies to account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions resulting from direct human-induced degradation and devegetation activities, with a view to the Conference of the Parties at its tenth session recommending a decision for adoption by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session regarding whether such activities should be included in the first commitment period; (b) To investigate the possible application of biome-specific forest definitions for the second and subsequent commitment periods with a view to the Conference of the Parties at its tenth session recommending a decision for adoption on the use of such biome-specific forest definitions for future commitment periods to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session; (c) To incorporate the work of the IPCC as outlined in paragraph 3 (d) below into any revisions of modalities, rules and guidelines prior to the second commitment period, for the accounting of activities under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol; (d) To develop at its fifteenth session terms of reference for the work to be conducted under paragraph 2 (e) below; (e) To develop definitions and modalities for including afforestation and reforestation project activities under Article 12 in the first commitment period, taking into account the issues This text was given limited distribution at the second part of the sixth session under the symbol FCCC/CP/2001/L.11/Rev.1. FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 6 of non-permanence, additionality, leakage, uncertainties and socio-economic and environmental impacts, including impacts on biodiversity and natural ecosystems, and being guided by the principles in the preamble to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) and the terms of reference referred to in paragraph 2 (d) above, with the aim of adopting a decision on these definitions and modalities at the ninth session of the Conference of the Parties, to be forwarded to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session; Invites the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): (a) To elaborate methods to estimate, measure, monitor, and report changes in carbon stocks and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4, and Articles 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol on the basis of the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, taking into account decisions -/CMP.1 and -/CP.7, to be submitted for consideration and possible adoption to the Conference of the Parties at its ninth session; (b) To prepare a report on good practice guidance and uncertainty management relating to the measurement, estimation, assessment of uncertainties, monitoring and reporting of net carbon stock changes and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the land use, land-use change and forestry sector, taking into consideration decisions - /CMP.1 and -/CP.7, to be submitted for consideration and possible adoption to the Conference of the Parties at its ninth session; () To develop definitions for direct human-induced ‘degradation’ of forests and ‘devegetation’ of other vegetation types and methodological options to inventory and report on emissions resulting from these activities, to be submitted for consideration and possible adoption to the Conference of the Parties at its ninth session; and, (d) To develop practicable methodologies to factor out direct human-induced changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks from changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks due to indirect human-induced and natural effects (such as those from carbon dioxide fertilization and nitrogen deposition), and effects due to past practices in forests (pre-reference year), to be submitted to the Conference of the Parties at its tenth session; 4. Decides that any changes to the treatment of harvested wood products shall be in accordance with future decisions of the Conference of the Parties. FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 7 Draft decision -/CMP.1 Land use, land-use change and forestry The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, Affirming that the implementation of land use, land-use change and forestry activities included under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol shall be consistent with the objectives and principles of, and any decisions taken under, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, Having considered decision -/CP.7 adopted by the Conference of the Parties at the second part of its sixth session, 1. Affirms that the following principles govern the treatment of land use, land-use change and forestry activities: That the treatment of these activities be based on sound science; (a) (b) That consistent methodologies be used over time for the estimation and reporting of these activities; (c) That the aim stated in Article 3.1 of the Kyoto Protocol not be changed by accounting for land use, land-use change and forestry activities; That the mere presence of carbon stocks be excluded from accounting; (d) (e) That the implementation of land use, land-use change and forestry activities contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources; 3] That accounting for land use, land-use change and forestry does not imply a transfer of commitments to a future commitment period; (2) That reversal of any removal due to land use, land-use change and forestry activities be accounted for at the appropriate point in time; (h) That accounting excludes removals resulting from: (i) elevated carbon dioxide concentrations above their pre-industrial level; (i1) indirect nitrogen deposition; and (iii) the dynamic effects of age structure resulting from activities and practices before the reference year; 2. Decides that good practice guidance, and methods to estimate, measure, monitor and report changes in carbon stocks and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry activities, as developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, shall be applied by Parties, if decided in accordance with relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 8 3. Decides that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks shall be accounted for in accordance with the annex to this decision and reported in annual inventories and reviewed in accordance with relevant decisions relating to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol, and in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, any future elaboration of these guidelines, or parts of them, and any good practice guidance on land-use change and forestry in accordance with relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; 4. Adopts the definitions, modalities, rules and guidelines relating to land use, land- use change and forestry activities under Articles 3, 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol contained in the annex for application in the first commitment period. FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 9 ANNEX Definitions, modalities, rules and guidelines relating to land use, land-use change and forestry activities under the Kyoto Protocol A. Definitions 1. For land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Articles” 3.3 and 3.4, the following definitions shall apply: (a) “Forest” is a minimum area of land of 0.05-1.0 hectares with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10-30 per cent with trees with the potential to reach a minimum height of 2-5 metres at maturity in situ. A forest may consist either of closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground or open forest. Young natural stands and all plantations which have yet to reach a crown density of 10-30 per cent or tree height of 2-5 metres are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention such as harvesting or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest; (b) “Afforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of land that has not been forested for a period of at least 50 years to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources; (c) “Reforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of non-forested land to forested land through planting, seeding and/or the human-induced promotion of natural seed sources, on land that was forested but that has been converted to non-forested land. For the first commitment period, reforestation activities will be limited to reforestation occurring on those lands that did not contain forest on 31 December 1989; (d) “Deforestation” is the direct human-induced conversion of forested land to non- forested land; (e) “Revegetation” is a direct human-induced activity to increase carbon stocks on sites through the establishment of vegetation that covers a minimum area of 0.05 hectares and does not meet the definitions of afforestation and reforestation contained here; 3] “Forest management” is a system of practices for stewardship and use of forest land aimed at fulfilling relevant ecological (including biological diversity), economic and social functions of the forest in a sustainable manner; (2) “Cropland management” is the system of practices on land on which agricultural crops are grown and on land that is set aside or temporarily not being used for crop production; (h) “Grazing land management” is the system of practices on land used for livestock production aimed at manipulating the amount and type of vegetation and livestock produced. > “Article” in this annex refers to an Article of the Kyoto Protocol, unless otherwise specified. FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 10 B. Article 3.3 2. For the purposes of Article 3.3, eligible activities are those direct human-induced afforestation, reforestation and/or deforestation activities that meet the requirements set forth in this annex and that started on or after 1 January 1990 and before 31 December of the last year of the commitment period. 3. For the purposes of determining the area of deforestation to come into the accounting system under Article 3.3, each Party shall determine the forest area using the same spatial assessment unit as is used for the determination of afforestation and reforestation, but not larger than 1 hectare. 4. For the first commitment period, debits’ resulting from harvesting during the first commitment period following afforestation and reforestation since 1990 shall not be greater than credits® accounted for on that unit of land. 5. Each Party included in Annex I shall report, in accordance with Article 7, on how harvesting or forest disturbance that is followed by the re-establishment of a forest is distinguished from deforestation. This information will be subject to review in accordance with Article 8. C. Article 3.4 6. A Party included in Annex I may choose to account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from any or all of the following human- induced activities, other than afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, under Article 3.4 in the first commitment period: revegetation, forest management, cropland management, and grazing land management. 7. A Party included in Annex I wishing to account for activities under Article 3.4 shall identify, in its report to enable the establishment of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3.7 and Article 3.8, the activities under Article 3.4 which it elects to include in its accounting for the first commitment period. Upon election, a decision by a Party will be fixed for the first commitment period. 8. During the first commitment period, a Party included in Annex I that selects any or all of the activities mentioned in paragraph 6 above shall demonstrate that such activities have occurred since 1990 and are human-induced. A Party included in Annex I shall not account for emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from activities under Article 3.4, if these are already accounted for under Article 3.3. 9. For the first commitment period, accountable anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation under Article 3.4, shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by 3 ‘Debits’: where emissions are larger than removals on a unit of land. 4 . . . ‘Credits’: where removals are larger than emissions on a unit of land. FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 11 sources and removals by sinks in the commitment period, less five times the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from these eligible activities in the base year of that Party, while avoiding double accounting. 10. For the first commitment period, a Party included in Annex I that incurs a net source of emissions under the provisions of Article 3.3 may account for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in areas under forest management under Article 3.4, up to a level that is equal to the net source of emissions under the provisions of Article 3.3, but not greater than [8.2] megatons of carbon times five, if the total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the managed forest since 1990 is equal to, or larger than, the net source of emissions incurred under Article 3.3. 11. For the first commitment period only, additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party’ resulting from forest management under Article 3.4, after the application of paragraph 10 above and resulting from forest management project activities undertaken under Article 6, shall not exceed the value inscribed in the appendix ° to this decision, times five. 12. A Party may request the Conference of the Parties to reconsider its numerical values as contained in paragraph 10 and in the appendix to paragraph 11, with a view to the Conference of the Parties recommending a decision for adoption to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, no later than 2 years prior to the beginning of the first commitment period.” Such a reconsideration shall be based upon country-specific data and the elements of guidance and consideration in footnote 6 to paragraph 11. These shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with relevant decisions related to Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol, and in accordance with the Revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, any future elaboration of these guidelines, or parts of them, and any good practice guidance on land use, land-use change and forestry in accordance with the relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties. D. Article 12 13. The eligibility of land-use, land-use change and forestry project activities under Article 12 is limited to afforestation and reforestation. As will be elaborated in the relevant decision dealing with modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts. In arriving at the values in the appendix below, the Conference of the Parties was guided by the application of an 85 per cent discount factor to account for the removals identified in paragraph 1(h) in the preamble of decision - /CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) and a 3 per cent cap on forest management, using a combination of data provided by Parties and by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Consideration was also given to national circumstances (including the degree of effort needed to meet Kyoto commitments and the forest management measures implemented). The accounting framework established in this paragraph shall not be construed as establishing any precedent for the second and subsequent commitment periods. 7 The Russian Federation does not recognize the numerical value in paragraph 10 and the value for the Russian Federation in the appendix to paragraph 11 as final values for it. (See FCCC/CP/2001/CRP.10.) FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 12 14. For the first commitment period, the total of additions to a Party’s assigned amount resulting from eligible land-use, land-use change and forestry project activities under Article 12 shall not exceed one per cent of base year emissions of that Party, times five. 15. The treatment of land-use, land-use change and forestry project activities under Article 12 in future commitment periods shall be decided as part of the negotiations on the second commitment period. E. General 16. Each Party included in Annex I shall, for the purposes of applying the definition of “forest” as contained in paragraph 1 (a) above, select a single minimum tree crown cover value between 10 and 30 per cent, a single minimum land area value between 0.05 and 1 hectare and a single minimum tree height value between 2 and 5 metres. The selection of a Party shall be fixed for the duration of the first commitment period. The selection shall be included as an integral part of its report to enable the establishment of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3.7 and 3.8 in accordance with decision -/CP.7, and shall include the values for tree crown cover, tree height and the minimum land area. Each Party shall justify in its reporting that such values are consistent with the information that has historically been reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations or other international bodies, and if they differ, explain why and how such values were chosen. 17. For the first commitment period, and subject to other provisions in this annex, the additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party pursuant to Article 3.7 and 3.8 shall be equal to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under Article 3.3 and forest management under Article 3.4, that have taken place since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink of greenhouse gases, this value shall be added to the assigned amount of that Party. Where the result of this calculation is a net source of greenhouse gas emissions, this value shall be subtracted from the assigned amount of that Party. 18. Accounting of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4, shall begin with the onset of the activity or the beginning of the commitment period, whichever comes later. 19. Once land is accounted for under Article 3.3 and 3.4, all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources from and removals by sinks on this land must be accounted for throughout subsequent and contiguous commitment periods. 20. National inventory systems under Article 5.1 shall ensure that areas of land subject to land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 are identifiable, and information about these areas should be provided by each Party included in Annex I in their national inventories in accordance with Article 7. Such information will be reviewed in accordance with Article 8. FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2 English Page 13 21. Each Party included in Annex I shall account for all changes in the following carbon pools: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon. A Party may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period, if transparent and verifiable information is provided that the pool is not a source.

WORK PROGRAMME ON MECHANISMS (DECISIONS 7/CP.4 AND 14/CP4) Note The following text’ represents work in progress as at the end of the second part of the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties. Based on the text contained in document FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3 (vol. V), using the consolidated negotiating text on mechanisms proposed by the President (FCCC/CP/2001/2/Add.2) as a tool, and fully taking into account “The Bonn Agreements on the implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action” (decision 5/CP.6). The",N/A,"In order to allow Parties to be fully aware of the progress made on the work on mechanisms at the end of the second part of the sixth session and to facilitate the smooth continuation of work at the seventh session, the status of the text is marked as follows: agreed text as reflected in decision 5/CP.6 is marked with “+++"";","text agreed in ing groups is marked with “++""; and text partially agreed in ing groups is marked with “+”. Unmarked text is either not agreed or has not yet been considered. It should be noted that the four decisions on mechanisms were not, or at least not in their entirety, taken up by Parties at the second part of the sixth session. Parties wished instead to concentrate on the annexes to the decisions during the limited time available. Therefore they also agreed to take up the appendices to the annexes on Articles 6 and 12 only at the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties. Wherever possible, issues of a cross- cutting nature have been addressed in only one of the decisions. Cross-references have been made to trace how such issues have been dealt with. Regarding appendices A and B to the annex of the decision on Article 6 projects, one group of Parties announced that it would submit a proposal for a miscellaneous document before the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties. ’ This text was given restricted distribution at the second part of the sixth session under the symbol FCCC/CP/2001/CRP.11.

(2 39. + The registration by the executive board shall be deemed final 60 days after the date of receipt by the executive board of the request for registration unless a Party involved in the project activity, or at least one fourth of the members of the executive board, requests a review of the proposed CDM project activity. The review by the executive board shall be made in accordance with the following provisions: ++ Be related to issues associated with the validation requirements; (a) (b) ++ Be finalized no later than at the second meeting following the request for review, with the decision and the reasons for it being communicated to the project participants and the public. 40. ++ A proposed project activity that is not accepted may be reconsidered for validation and subsequent registration, after appropriate revisions, provided that it follows the procedures and meets the requirements for validation and registration, including those related to public comments. 41. ++ A CDM project activity is additional if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases by sources are reduced below those that would have occurred in the absence of the registered CDM project activity. 42. + The baseline for a CDM project activity is the scenario that reasonably represents the anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity. A baseline shall cover emissions from all gases, sectors and source categories listed in Annex A within the project boundary. A baseline shall be deemed to reasonably represent the anthropogenic emissions by sources that would occur in the absence of the proposed project activity if it is derived using a baseline methodology referred to in paragraphs 35 and 36 above. ++ A baseline shall be established: 43. (a) ++ By project participants in accordance with provisions for the use of approved and new methodologies, contained in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and the present annex; (b) ++ In a transparent and conservative manner regarding the choice of approaches, assumptions, methodologies, parameters, data sources, key factors and additionality, and taking into account uncertainty; ++ On a project-specific basis; (c) (d) ++ In the case of small-scale CDM project activities which meet the criteria specified in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP, in accordance with simplified procedures developed for such activities; (e) ++ Taking into account relevant national and/or sectoral policies and circumstances, such as sectoral reform initiatives, local fuel availability, power sector expansion plans, and the economic situation in the project sector. 44. ++ The baseline may include a scenario where future anthropogenic emissions by sources are projected to rise above current levels, due to the specific circumstances of the host Party. 45. ++ The baseline shall be defined in a way that CERs cannot be earned for decreases in activity levels due to force majeure. 46. ++ In choosing a baseline methodology for a project activity, project participants shall select from among the following approaches the one deemed most appropriate for the project activity, taking into account any guidance by the executive board, and justify the appropriateness of their choice: ++ Existing actual or historical emissions, as applicable; or (a) (b) ++ Emissions from a technology that represents an economically attractive course of action, taking into account barriers to investment; or (c) ++ The average emissions of similar project activities undertaken in the previous five years, in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances, and whose performance is among the top 20 percent of their category. 47. ++ Project participants shall select a crediting period for a proposed project activity from one of the following alternative approaches: (a) ++ A maximum of seven years which may be renewed at most two times, provided that, for each renewal, a designated operational entity determines and informs the executive board that the original project baseline is still valid or has been updated taking account of new data where applicable; or ++ A maximum of ten years with no option of renewal. (b) 48. ++ Reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources shall be adjusted for leakage in accordance with the monitoring and verification provisions in paragraphs 57 and 60 (f) respectively. 49. ++ Leakage is defined as the net change of anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases which occurs outside the project boundary, and that is measurable and attributable to the CDM project activity. 50. ++ The project boundary shall encompass all anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases under the control of the project participants that are significant and reasonably attributable to the CDM project activity. H. Monitoring 51. ++ Project participants shall include, as part of the project design document, a monitoring plan that provides for: (a) ++ The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for estimating or measuring anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases occurring within the project boundary during the crediting period; (b) ++ The collection and archiving of all relevant data necessary for determining the baseline of anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases within the project boundary during the crediting period; (c) ++ The identification of all potential sources of, and the collection and archiving of data on, increased anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases outside the project boundary that are significant and reasonably attributable to the project activity during the crediting period; (d) ++ The collection and archiving of information relevant to the provisions in paragraph 35 (c) above; ++ Quality assurance and control procedures for the monitoring process; (e) () ++ Procedures for the periodic calculation of the reductions of anthropogenic emissions by sources by the proposed CDM project activity, and for leakage effects; (2) ++ Documentation of all steps involved in the calculations referred to in subparagraphs 51 (c) and 51 (f) above. 52. + A monitoring plan for a proposed project activity shall be based on a previously approved monitoring methodology or a new methodology, in accordance with paragraphs 35 and 36 above, that: (a) ++ Is determined by the designated operational entity as appropriate to the circumstances of the proposed project activity and has been successfully applied elsewhere; ++ Reflects good monitoring practice appropriate to the type of project activity. (b) 53. For small-scale CDM project activities meeting the criteria specified in decision -/CP.7 (Article 12) and relevant decisions by the COP/MOP, project participants may use simplified monitoring methodologies in accordance with paragraphs 35 and 36 above. 54. ++ Project participants shall implement the monitoring plan contained in the registered project design document. 55. Revisions to the monitoring plan require justification by project participants that the revisions improve the accuracy and/or completeness of information and shall be validated by the relevant designated operational entity. 56. + The implementation of the registered monitoring plan and its revisions, as applicable, shall be a condition for verification, certification and the issuance of CERs. 57. ++ Subsequent to the monitoring and reporting of reductions in anthropogenic emissions, CERs resulting from a CDM project activity during a specified time period shall be calculated, applying the registered methodology, by subtracting the actual anthropogenic emissions by sources from baseline emissions and adjusting for leakage. 58. ++ The project participants shall provide to the designated operational entity, contracted by the project participants to perform the verification, a monitoring report in accordance with the registered monitoring plan set out in paragraph 51 above for the purpose of verification and certification. 1.

Certification is the written assurance by the designated operational entity that, during a specified time period, a project activity achieved the reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases as verified. 60. ++In accordance with the provisions on confidentiality in paragraph 26 (h) above, the designated operational entity contracted by the project participants to perform the verification shall make the monitoring report publicly available, and: (a) ++ Determine whether the project documentation provided is in accordance with the requirements of the registered project design document and relevant provisions of decision - /CP.7 (Article 12) and the present annex; (b) ++ Conduct on-site inspections, as appropriate, that may comprise, inter alia, a review of performance records, interviews with project participants and local stakeholders, collection of measurements, observation of established practices and testing of the accuracy of monitoring equipment; ++ If appropriate, use additional data from other sources; (c) (d) ++ Review monitoring results and verify that the monitoring methodologies for the estimation of reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources have been applied correctly and their documentation is complete and transparent; (e) ++ Recommend to the project participants appropriate changes to the monitoring methodology for any future crediting period, if necessary; 6] ++ Determine the reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that would not have occurred in the absence of the CDM project activity, based on the data and information derived under subparagraph 60 (a) and obtained under subparagraphs 60 (b) and/or 60 (c), as appropriate, using calculation procedures consistent with those contained in the registered project design document and in the monitoring plan; (2) ++ Identify and inform the project participants of any concerns related to the conformity of the actual project activity and its operation with the registered project design document. Project participants shall address the concerns and supply relevant additional information,; (h) ++ Provide a verification report to the project participants, the Parties involved and the executive board. The report shall be made publicly available. 61. ++ The designated operational entity shall, based on its verification report, certify in writing that, during the specified time period, the project activity achieved the verified amount of reductions in anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases that would not have occurred in the absence of the CDM project activity. It shall inform the project participants, Parties involved and the executive board of its certification decision in writing immediately upon completion of the certification process and make the certification report publicly available. J. Issuance of certified emission reductions 62. ++ The certification report shall constitute a request for issuance to the executive board of CERs equal to the verified amount of reductions of anthropogenic emissions by sources of greenhouse gases. 63. + The issuance shall be considered final 15 days after the date of receipt of the request for issuance, unless a Party involved in the project activity, or at least one fourth of the members of the executive board request a review of the proposed CDM project activity. Such a review shall be limited to issues of fraud, malfeasance or incompetence of the designated operational entities and be conducted as follows: (a) ++ Upon receipt of a request for such a review, the executive board, at its next meeting, shall decide on its course of action.

That, during the first commitment period, a Party that selects any or all of the activities mentioned in paragraph 4 above shall demonstrate that such activities have occurred since 1990 and are human-induced. Such activities should not account for emissions and removals resulting from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation as accounted for under Article 3.3. 6. That the following accounting rules are applicable in the first commitment period only. They aim to pragmatically implement the guiding principles in the preamble: (a) Application of net-net accounting (net emissions or removals over the commitment period less net emissions or removals in the base year, times five) for agricultural activities (cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation); (b) Accounting for forest management up to the level of any possible Article 3.3 debits, if the total carbon stock change in the managed forests since 1990 is equal to or larger than this Article 3.3 debit (up to 8.2 megatons of carbon per Party per year; no discounting); (c) Additions to and subtractions from the assigned amount of a Party® resulting from forest management under Article 3.4 after the application of the Article 3.3 debit compensation described in subparagraph (b) above and resulting from forest management undertaken under Article 6, shall not exceed the value inscribed in Appendix Z to this decision; ° 7. That for the first commitment period, the eligibility of land use, land-use change and forestry project activities under Article 12 is limited to afforestation and reforestation; As will be elaborated in decision -/CP.6 (modalities for accounting for assigned amounts). In arriving at the values in Appendix Z, the Conference of the Parties was guided by the application of an 85 per cent discount factor to account for the removals identified in paragraph 1(h) and a 3 per cent cap on forest management, using a combination of data provided by Parties and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Consideration was also given to national circumstances (including the degree of effort needed to meet Kyoto commitments and the forest management measures implemented). The accounting framework established in this paragraph shall not be construed as establishing any precedent for the second and subsequent commitment period. 6 The zero entry for Australia in Appendix Z reflects the fact that Australia is determined to be eligible to access the second sentence of Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol. 8. That for the first commitment period, the total of additions to the assigned amount of a Party resulting from eligible land use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article12 shall not exceed one per cent of base year emissions of that Party, times five; 9. To request the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice to develop definitions and modalities for including afforestation and reforestation projects under the clean development mechanism in the first commitment period, to address the issues of non-permanence, additionality, leakage, uncertainties and socio-economic and environmental impacts, including impacts on biodiversity and natural ecosystems, and being guided by the principles in paragraph 1 and terms of reference to be agreed by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, with the aim of adopting a decision on these definitions and modalities at its ninth session, to be forwarded to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its first session.

Affirms that the following principles govern the treatment of land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities: That the treatment of these activities be based on sound science, (a) (b) Consistent methodologies be used over time for the estimation and reporting of these activities, (c) The aim stated in Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Kyoto Protocol not be changed by accounting for LULUCEF activities, That the mere presence of carbon stocks be excluded from accounting, (d) (e) That the implementation of LULUCF activities contributes to the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources, 3] That accounting for LULUCF does not imply a transfer of commitments to a future commitment period, (2) That reversal of any removal due to LULUCF activities be accounted for at the appropriate point in time, (h) That accounting excludes removals resulting from (a) elevated carbon dioxide concentrations above their pre-industrial level; (b) indirect nitrogen deposition and (c) the dynamic effects of age structure resulting from activities and practices before the reference year. The Conference of the Parties agrees: 2. On a definition of “forest” and on definitions of the activities “afforestation”, “reforestation” and “deforestation” for the purpose of implementing Article 3.3. These activities shall be defined on the basis of a change in land use. 3. That debits from harvesting during the first commitment period following afforestation and reforestation since 1990 shall not be greater than credits earned on that unit of land. 9% ¢¢ 9% ¢¢ 4. That “forest management”, “cropland management”, “grazing land management” and “revegetation” are eligible land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, paragraph 4, of the Kyoto Protocol.

Annex Recommendations on ways Governments and the United Nations system could support volunteering 1. General considerations 1. In these Recommendations the terms volunteering, volunteerism and voluntary activities refer to a wide range of activities, including traditional forms of mutual aid and self-help, formal service delivery and other forms of civic participation, undertaken of free will, for the general public good and where monetary reward is not the principal motivating factor. 2. Actions by Governments and the United Nations system are mutually reinforcing but are treated separately below for the sake of clarity. 3. There is not one universal model of best practice since what works well in one country may not work in another with very different cultures and traditions. 4. Support for voluntary activities does not imply support for government downsizing or for replacing paid employment. 5. It is not just targeted measures that have an impact on volunteering; general social and economic policy measures can also influence citizens’ opportunities and willingness to volunteer. A/56/L.27 6. Neglecting to factor volunteering into the design and implementation of policies could entail the risk of overlooking a valuable asset and undermine traditions of cooperation that bind communities together. 7. It is important to ensure that opportunities for volunteering in all sectors are open to both women and men, given their different levels of participation in different areas, and recognizing the potential positive effect of volunteering on the empowerment of women. II. Government support 1. It is recommended that Governments further support voluntary activities by creating a favourable environment, including through the following policies and measures, and taking into account the local cultural context. (a) Increasing public awareness of the vital contribution of volunteerism to the social and economic functioning of their communities through, inter alia, public information activities and public events (1) Highlight the contribution of volunteering; organize briefings and seminars for policy makers and the media. Official papers on the status of volunteering and the issues that need to be addressed can be published and widely disseminated. High profile events and campaigns can be organized on national days and on International Volunteer Day (5 December). Negative stereotyping of volunteers can be challenged. Promotion of volunteering can be achieved through special programmes and public service announcements or by joint initiatives such as award schemes; (i1) Encourage the media to play a supportive role in public awareness- raising activities; (iii) Disseminate the results of studies and surveys on the contribution of volunteerism through the media, schools, non-governmental organizations and other channels. (b) Taking general measures concerning encouragement and facilitation, preparation, training and recognition of volunteers (1) Provide, in a way complementary to the support from other sources, an adequate human and physical infrastructure for volunteering. This could include, inter alia, awareness-raising campaigns, development of a volunteer centre infrastructure, establishment of focal points or the use of pilot schemes and the promotion of online volunteering. Specific campaigns in the area of, for example, mass immunization, literacy, or low-cost housing, could include budgetary provision for the encouragement and facilitation, orientation and training, monitoring and recognition of volunteers; (i1) Facilitate the establishment and functioning of volunteer centres, which provide a valuable stimulus to formal service volunteering through advocacy, monitoring and encouraging new initiatives. National volunteer centres provide effective leadership in the formal volunteer movement, while regional and local centres ensure linkages with the grass-roots communities. Legal and fiscal frameworks are important factors in the sustainability of such centres and financial support may also be desirable; A/56/L.27 (iii) Provide or facilitate specialized training and the formation of professional volunteer managers and trainers in the area of formal service volunteering, including by introducing formal credentials and standards; (iv) Encourage public sector workers to volunteer, for instance by facilitating measures, recognition, career enhancement incentives and the establishment of a dedicated special unit. This sets a positive example for society and helps to strengthen the sense of collective responsibility. (c) Enabling fiscal, legislative and other frameworks, including for community-based organizations and not-for-profit organizations engaged in volunteering (1) Introduce enabling legislation. The goal is to encourage or inspire citizens to volunteer but allow the choice to rest with the individual or organization; it can also facilitate employee volunteering. It can provide tax incentives and subsidies for organizations, as well as coverage and protection against risks, in a way fitting the particular society; (i1) Facilitate partnership-building around volunteer-based activities of civil society, including arrangements for joint planning, implementation and monitoring. This could incorporate employee volunteer activities of the private sector. (d) Encouraging and undertaking research in the various aspects of volunteerism and its impact on society (1) Ensure that consideration of the issues regarding volunteering is based on a sound appreciation and analysis of the parameters, profile and trends of volunteering in the particular country context. Studies on volunteering can be undertaken by independent public policy research and/or academic institutions. Governments can also initiate research themselves, in partnership with other stakeholders; (i1) Establish the economic value of volunteering to help to highlight one important aspect of its overall contribution to society and thereby assist in the development of informed policies which take into account the different levels of participation of women and men, youth and older people in different fields of volunteering. (e) Ensuring citizens’ access to information on opportunities for volunteering (1) Facilitate the establishment of national databases on volunteer opportunities in collaboration with community-based organizations and not- for-profit organizations; (i1) Disseminate information through the media, schools, and other channels with particular attention given to ensuring that information is accessible also to disadvantaged segments of the population. Encourage media companies to support and expand the concept of pro bono public service announcements on behalf of volunteer-based organizations and activities. (f) Addressing the possible impact of general social and economic policy measures upon citizens’ opportunities and willingness to volunteer A/56/L.27 (i) Take into account the possible impact of general social and economic policy upon citizens’ opportunities to volunteer. Such a “volunteer check” could pertain to measures related to labour, for example, such as the length of the work week and the age of retirement, which have an impact on the profile of volunteering. Legal and fiscal measures could also be reviewed to assess whether they impinge negatively on the status of volunteer involving organizations, including issues related to juridical status, rights to associational activities, and resource mobilization. Subsequently, legal and administrative hindrances to volunteering, where they exist, can be reduced; (i) Give due weight to local ownership and citizen participation, to bring public services closer to communities and to open space for greater citizen engagement expressed through channels such as parental involvement in schools and community involvement in natural resource management; (iii) Recognize that transport, communication and other infrastructure, such as public spaces, enhances the capacity of people to organize for voluntary activities. This is especially true of geographically dispersed populations and of people living in poverty, as well as older persons and people with disabilities. It is desirable that the impact of such infrastructure on levels of volunteering be factored into the planning process. (g) Integrating volunteerism into national development planning, recognizing the potential contribution of volunteerism to the achievement of sustainable development goals (1) Extend the notion of volunteerism as an additional valuable component of national development planning to development cooperation policy. Recognizing and building strategically on rich, local traditions of voluntary self-help and mutual aid can open the way to building up a new constituency in support of development efforts. Forging a link in the mind of the general public in countries providing development assistance between domestic volunteering in those countries and volunteering in countries receiving assistance can also help enlist public support for development cooperation. (h) Participation of all population groups (1) Consider all means available for more people to become involved in voluntary activities and to be drawn from a broader cross-section of society, including youth, older persons and people with disabilities and persons belonging to minorities, targeting opportunities for voluntary activities to facilitate the active participation of those groups which have little or no access to the benefits of engaging in volunteering; (i) Promote volunteering within educational establishments and youth services; develop specific programmes to encourage youth volunteering; put in place systems to recognize and accredit volunteering by youth; and work with the media to present an attractive image of volunteering. This can have a significant impact on the level of youth participation and constitute a sound investment in a country’s human resources. A/56/L.27 III. Support by the United Nations system 1. It is recommended that the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, including the regional commissions, further support voluntary activities by creating a favourable environment, including through: (a) Awareness-raising (1) Raise awareness internally and with their partners as regards the role of volunteerism in the various areas in which they are active and can sensitize their constituencies as to the implications in terms of activities undertaken. At the political level, strategically manage and support volunteering and incorporate it into the agenda of their meetings; (i1) Undertake research and disseminate information about the cross-cutting link between volunteerism and major global concerns, including through technical and popular publications, workshops and Internet sites. This would serve also to extend recognition to volunteers and their organizations, which could be complemented by awards and other measures, including raising the profile of International Volunteer Day for Economic and Social Development on 5 December. (b) Recognition of the contributions of volunteers (1) Enhance and expand the current practice of extending special recognition to volunteers and volunteer-involving organizations across the United Nations system. (c) Involving volunteers in their programmes, interlinking with national initiatives (1) Include volunteers in their activities, supporting, inter alia, the establishment of volunteer schemes to address a range of global concerns. Where they exist, national and local volunteer centres could benefit substantially from the specialized expertise and networks of the United Nations system; (i) Actively encourage staff of the United Nations system to volunteer, utilizing their special skills and experiences.
