participation, Recalling that the right to privacy, as well as freedom of expression and freedom of access to information, contribute to enabling the free development of an individual’s personality

medical and health data, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken on a mass scale,

capabilities of business enterprises to collect, process and use personal data can pose a risk to the right to privacy, Noting also the impact that certain business enterprises may have on the enjoyment of human rights, given that they may be able, through technological means or owing to a dominant position in the market, to influence or restrict the free flow of information, Welcoming

sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting also in that respect that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Recognizing that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful environment in cyberspace is of paramount importance for the

Recognizing the need to adopt or strengthen legislative or other measures, such as educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand, which fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to trafficking, Recognizing also the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations, including in conflict and post-conflict environments, natural disasters and other emergency environments, as well as the devastating consequences for women and girls in such circumstances, and noting in this regard the Migrants in Countries in Crisis initiative and the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change resulting from the Nansen Initiative, while recognizing that not all States are participating in them, Recognizing further the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of being trafficked and to help to identify victims of trafficking in persons, Recognizing that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls and to protecting and assisting the victims of human trafficking remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt and implement adequate legislation and other measures and to continue improving the 4/13 collection of reliable data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant factors and of statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls, Recognizing also that further work is required both to better understand the link between migration and

exploitation of the prostitution of others, including for exploiting women and children and for child pornography, including sexual abuse material, paedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse of children, as well as for forced marriage and forced labour, while acknowledging the role that information and communications technologies play in reducing the risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, including by empowering women and children to report such abuses, Concerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of national laws and international standards, Noting with concern that women and girls are also vulnerable to the risk of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and in this regard taking note of Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 25/1, entitled “Preventing and combating trafficking in human organs and trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal”,’” adopted by the Commission at its twenty-fifth session, Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons, Noting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, exploitative labour and the illegal removal of organs is met by trafficking in persons, and recognizing that human trafficking is fuelled by high profits for traffickers and demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, owing to pervasive and persistent gender inequality, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of the violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness, See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2016, Supplement No. 10
