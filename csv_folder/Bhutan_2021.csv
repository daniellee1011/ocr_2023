the right to development, as well as gender equality, the empowerment of women and intergenerational equity, Noting the Secretary-General’s Call to Action for Human Rights, which calls for, inter

growing risk of emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin may be caused by human actions that damage ecosystems and biodiversity, stressing that biodiversity is important for the enjoyment of a
