GE.10-14411 A/HRC/14/L.9/Rev.1 Underscoring the fact that the duty of States to exercise due diligence to prevent violence against women and girls includes using all appropriate means of a legal, political, administrative and social nature that promote the protection of human rights and ensuring that acts of violence are considered and treated as illegal acts for which adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate punishment and remedies, including reparations, are available, Recognizing that power imbalances and structural inequality between men and women are among the root causes of violence against women, and that effective prevention of violence against women and girls requires action at all levels of government, the engagement of civil society, the involvement of men and boys and the adoption and implementation of multifaceted and comprehensive approaches that promote gender equality and empowerment of women, and integrate awareness, education, training, political will, legislation, accountability, targeted policies and programmes, specific measures to reduce vulnerability, data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and protection, support and redress for women who have experienced violence, Recognizing also that violence against women is one of the factors impeding progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, Recognizing further the importance of the full participation of women in the development of effective policies and programmes relating to the prevention of violence against women, Acknowledging that confronting and changing the harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women are fundamental to ensuring effective prevention, Stressing that the realization of all human rights by women and girls, such as those regarding ownership of land, property, inheritance, housing, financial services, including loans, nationality and legal capacity, education, conditions of work, access to health, economic participation, access to labour and disparities in salaries and compensation, public and political participation, access to decision-making processes, social security and cultural life, supported by interventions dealing with legal literacy, skills training and access to productive resources, is a key factor in preventing violence against women and girls, and that, in many instances, the different treatment of women before the law has resulted in the lack of equal opportunities for them in these areas, Deeply concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination and disadvantage, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of some women and girls, including women belonging to minority groups, indigenous women, refugee and internally displaced women, stateless women, migrant women, women living in rural or remote communities, women living in slums and informal settlements, women living in conditions of poverty, women in institutions or in detention, women with disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in all situations of armed conflict, women who face trafficking, sexual or labour exploitation, and women who are otherwise discriminated against, including on the basis of their HIV/AIDS status, Concerned that the threat or risk of being exposed to violence may constitute a barrier to women and girls realizing their right to education, Alarmed that, in situations of armed conflict, women are particularly exposed to sexual and other forms of violence, and recognizing the need to intensify efforts to prevent such violence in accordance with intemational humanitarian law and human rights law, 1.

Also calls upon States to support initiatives undertaken by women’s groups, intemational and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and community groups and other relevant civil society actors aimed at promoting gender A/HRC/14/L.9/Rev.1 equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls, and raising awareness of and preventing violence against women and girls; 9.

Urges States to enhance efforts to involve men and boys in initiatives to prevent violence against women and in highlighting the unacceptability of violence against women; 13. Stresses that women should be empowered to protect themselves against violence and, in this regard, that women have the right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and calls upon States to take all necessary legislative and policy steps; 14. Calls upon States to strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacity of women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by providing HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services, to ensure protection from and prevention of stigma and discrimination, and to cooperate with United Nations bodies, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non- governmental organizations in this regard; 15.

V.10-53897 Annex Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Preamble 1. The multifaceted nature of violence against women necessitates different strategies to respond to the diverse manifestations of violence and the various settings in which it occurs, both in private and public life, whether committed in the home, the workplace, educational and training institutions, the community or society, in custody, or in situations of armed conflict and natural disaster. In the Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the importance of adopting a systematic, comprehensive, coordinated, multisectoral and sustained approach to fighting violence against women is recognized. The practical measures, strategies and activities described below can be introduced in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice to address violence against women. Except where otherwise specified, the term “women” encompasses “girl children”’. 2. Violence against women exists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace. Violence against women is rooted in historically unequal power relations between men and women. All forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and have serious immediate and long-term implications for health, including sexual and reproductive health, for example through increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and public safety, and have a negative impact on the psychological, social and economic development of individuals, families, communities and States. 3. Violence against women is often embedded in and supported by social values, cultural patterns and practices. The criminal justice system and legislators are not immune to such values and thus have not always regarded violence against women with the same seriousness as other types of violence. Therefore, it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligation with respect to its elimination and that the criminal justice system recognize violence against women as a gender-related problem and as an expression of power and inequality. 4. Violence against women is defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and reiterated in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women? to mean any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or a General Assembly resolution 48/104. ’ Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annex 1. V.10-53897 suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures build on the measures adopted by Governments in the Platform for Action, which was adopted in 1995 and subsequently reaffirmed in 2000 and 2005, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted in 1997, and relevant General Assembly resolutions, including Assembly resolutions 61/143 and 63/155, bearing in mind that some groups of women are especially exposed and vulnerable to violence. 5. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures specifically acknowledge the need for an active policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies, programmes and practices to ensure gender equality and equal and fair access to justice, as well as establishing the goal of gender balance in all areas of decision-making, including those related to the elimination of violence against women. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be applied as guidelines in a manner consistent with relevant international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,° the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4 the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,¢ the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,‘ the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime,i with a view to furthering their fair and effective implementation. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures reaffirm the commitment of States to promote gender equality and empower women with a view to meeting goal 3 of the Millennium Development Goals.i 6. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be endorsed by national legislation and implemented by Member States and other entities in a manner consistent with the right to equality before the law, while also recognizing that gender equality may sometimes require the adoption of different approaches that acknowledge the different ways in which violence affects women as compared to men. Member States should ensure that women have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice in order to facilitate efforts by Governments to prevent and sanction acts of violence against women through comprehensive and coordinated policies and strategies, and to deal with all forms of violence against women within the criminal justice system. 7. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women must be focused on the needs of victims and empower individual women who are victims of ¢ United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1249, No. 20378. d Tbid., vol. 1577, No. 27531. e Ibid., vol. 2171, No. 27531. f Ibid., vol. 999, No. 14668. & Ibid., vol. 2237, No. 39574. h Tbid., vol. 2187, No. 38544. i Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. ji A/56/326, annex. V.10-53897 violence. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at ensuring that prevention and intervention efforts are made to not only stop and appropriately sanction violence against women, but also restore a sense of dignity and control to the victims of such violence. 8. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim at contributing to de jure and de facto equality between women and men. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures do not give preferential treatment to women but aim at ensuring that any inequalities or forms of discrimination that women face in accessing justice, particularly in respect of acts of violence, are redressed. 9. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that sexual violence is an issue of international peace and security, as outlined in Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) on women and peace and security, particularly the need for parties to armed conflict to adopt prevention and protection measures in order to end sexual violence. 10. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that some special groups of women are particularly vulnerable to violence, either because of their nationality, ethnicity, religion or language, or because they belong to an indigenous group, are migrants, are stateless, are refugees, live in underdeveloped, rural or remote communities, are homeless, are in institutions or in detention, have disabilities, are elderly, are widowed or live in conflict, post-conflict and disaster situations and as such they require special attention, intervention and protection in the development of crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women. 11. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize advances in crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women and the importance of investing in the prevention of violence against women. 12. The Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that States have the obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, including women, and that they must exercise due diligence and take relevant measures to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women, to eliminate impunity and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of women’s human rights and fundamental freedoms. I. Guiding principles 13.

Throughout the review process, governmental experts and the secretariat shall be guided by the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the terms of reference of the Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 2. In particular, governmental experts shall bear in mind article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, which states that States parties shall carry out their obligations under the Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. 3. Furthermore, governmental experts shall carry out the reviews in full recognition of the purpose of the review process as specified in paragraph 11 of the terms of reference. 4. During all interactions within the review process, governmental experts shall respect the collective approach. Governmental experts are expected to act with courtesy and diplomacy, and shall remain objective and impartial. Governmental experts need to be flexible in their approach and ready to adapt to changes in schedules. 5. Governmental experts and the secretariat shall maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of, or used in, the country review process, as well as the country review report, as stipulated in the terms of reference. If there are serious grounds for believing that a governmental expert or a member of the secretariat has violated the obligation of confidentiality, the States parties concerned or the secretariat may inform the Implementation Oversight Group for appropriate consideration and action, including referring the matter to the Conference. 6. It is also expected that governmental experts are not to be influenced in their assessment of the implementation of the Convention. While information generated through competent regional and international organizations of which the State party under review is a member and whose mandates cover issues relevant to the review of the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols is to be taken into account, governmental experts shall make their own analysis of the facts provided by the State party under review in order to present findings that are in line with all the specific requirements of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto under review. 7. Throughout the review process, governmental experts are encouraged to contact the secretariat for any assistance required. 14 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6 II. Specific guidance for the conduct of the review 8. In accordance with the terms of reference and consistent with the importance of ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the review process, reviews shall be conducted in a spirit of constructive collaboration, dialogue and mutual trust. 9. States parties and the secretariat shall endeavour to adhere to the indicative timelines set out in the paragraphs below. 10. The governmental experts shall prepare themselves by: (a) Studying thoroughly the Convention and the terms of reference of the Mechanism, including the present guidelines; (b) Familiarizing themselves with the Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime’ as well as the Travaux Préparatoires of the Negotiations for the Elaboration of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto,® particularly those parts pertaining to the articles that are the subject of the relevant review cycle; (c) Reviewing the responses provided by the State party under review in its comprehensive self-assessment checklist and supplementary documentation and familiarizing themselves with the issues addressed by the State party under review; (d) Informing the secretariat if additional information and material are required and highlighting issues requiring further clarification. 11. The Secretariat shall organize periodic training courses for governmental experts who participate in the review process, so that they can familiarize themselves with the guidelines and increase their capacity to participate in the review process. 12. The secretariat, within one month after the drawing of lots, shall officially inform the State party under review and the reviewing States parties of the date of the beginning of the conduct of the country review, as well as of all relevant procedural matters, including the schedule for the training of experts and a provisional schedule for the country review. 13.

The State party under review shall, within two months of being officially informed of the beginning of the conduct of the country review, provide to the secretariat the information required on its compliance with and implementation of the Convention, using the comprehensive self-assessment checklist as an initial step for that purpose. Assistance in the preparation of the responses shall be provided by the secretariat to the State party requesting such assistance. The secretariat shall, within one month of the receipt of the checklist response, submit that response for translation and circulate it to the governmental experts. 16. Within one month after the State party under review has been officially informed about the beginning of the conduct of the country review, governmental experts shall participate in a telephone conference or videoconference, to be organized by the secretariat for the purpose of an initial introduction of the reviewing States parties, the State party under review and the staff member of the secretariat assigned to the country review, as well as for general orientation, including a review of the schedule and requirements established for the review. 17. Governmental experts from reviewing States parties shall take a decision on how to divide tasks and issues among themselves, taking into account their respective fields of competence. 18. While governmental experts shall establish open lines of communication with the State party under review, the experts shall keep the secretariat abreast of all these communications. 19. Throughout the process, the governmental experts shall appropriately consider the information and material provided by the State party under review through the different means of communication as described in the terms of reference. 20. When seeking additional information and asking for clarification, governmental experts shall bear in mind the non-adversarial, non-intrusive and non- punitive character of the review and the overall goal of assisting the State party under review to reach full implementation of the Convention. 21. Within one month of the receipt of the response to the comprehensive self- assessment checklist and any supplementary information provided by the State party under review, governmental experts shall submit to the secretariat the outcome of the desk review, including requests for clarifications, additional information or supplementary questions, to be translated into the designated languages of the review and provided to the State party under review. 22.

During the conference call, governmental experts from the reviewing States parties shall introduce their parts of the desk review and explain the findings. The ensuing dialogue shall ideally last up to two months and consist of requests for additional information or specific questions from the governmental experts, to 16 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6 which the State party under review shall respond, using various means of dialogue including conference calls, videoconferences, e-mail exchanges or further means of direct dialogue as mentioned in paragraph 24 of the terms of reference and as specified below. 24. If agreed by the State party under review, the desk review should be complemented by any further means of direct dialogue, such as a country visit or a joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. The country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna shall be planned and organized by the State party under review. While the secretariat will facilitate all practical arrangements, governmental experts shall take all necessary measures from their side to participate in the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, bearing in mind paragraph 29 of the terms of reference. 25. During the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, governmental experts shall uphold the principles and standards outlined in the general guidance above. 26. Governmental experts are expected to actively and constructively participate in all meetings, including at internal debriefings at the end of each working day, or at the end of the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 27. Governmental experts are expected to be respectful and courteous in meetings, respecting time frames set in the programme and allowing time for all members to participate. At the same time, governmental experts are expected to be flexible, as the programme may change during the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 28. Questions should seek to complement information already provided by the State party under review and relate only to the review process. Governmental experts shall therefore remain neutral and not voice personal opinions during the meetings. 29. Governmental experts are expected to take notes during all meetings, which they can refer to for the production of the final country review report. They shall share their opinions and preliminary findings in writing among themselves and with the secretariat within two weeks after the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 30. At the final stage of the country review process and preferably within five months of the beginning of the review, based on the blueprint format, the governmental experts shall, with the assistance of the secretariat, prepare a country review report and send it to the State party under review in the designated language of the review. The report shall identify successes, good practices and challenges and make observations for the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. Where appropriate, the report shall include the identification of technical assistance needs for the purpose of improving implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. The comments of the State party under review shall be incorporated into the country review report. 31. Governmental experts shall include observations with respect to the implementation in national law of the articles of the Convention and its Protocols under review, as well as their application in practice. 17 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6 32. Governmental experts shall further identify successes and good practices and challenges and make observations with respect to the implementation of the articles of the Convention and its Protocols under review, as well as areas where technical assistance may be required. 33. At the request of the State party under review and as required, governmental experts may also be asked to provide the State party under review with explanations of how to address the challenges identified so as to allow the State party to fully and effectively implement the relevant articles of the Convention and its Protocols. 34. The secretariat shall send the country review report to the State party under review for its agreement. In case of disagreement, there shall be a dialogue between the State party under review and the governmental experts to arrive at a consensual final report. An executive summary shall subsequently be prepared and agreed on. 18 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6 Appendix IT Blueprint for country review reports and executive summaries Review by [names of reviewing States| of the implementation by [name of State under review] of article(s) [number(s) of articles| of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [and articles [numbers] of the Protocols thereto| for the review cycle [time frame] Introduction 1.
