Recalls that it welcomed the release of political prisoners in August 2015, and called for the full reinstatement of the civil and political rights of former political prisoners; however, those civil and political rights have not been reinstated and political activists continue to be ill-treated and faced with questionable and politically motivated charges, while there has been no progress on four cases of enforced disappearance of political opponents dating back to 1999 and 2000; 13. Strongly encourages Belarus to implement the comprehensive reform of the electoral legal framework and to address long-standing systemic shortcomings pertaining to the electoral legal framework and practices, following the recommendations made by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) and the Special Rapporteur, and especially in view of the presidential election scheduled for 9 August 2020; 14.

Elimination of female genital mutilation,"The Human Rights Council, Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Recalling the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the optional protocols thereto, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and all other relevant international human rights instruments, Reaffirming that the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, together with the optional protocols thereto, constitute an important contribution to the legal framework for the protection and promotion of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women and girls, Recalling General Assembly resolution 73/149 of 17 December 2018, on intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilation, and all other relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on the Status of Women on measures to eliminate traditional practices that are detrimental to women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, as well as Human Rights Council resolution 38/6 of 5 July 2018 GE.20-09247(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/44/L.20 on the elimination of female genital mutilation and other Council resolutions on the same topic, Recalling also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, Recalling further the commitment made by States to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, Recalling the annual commemoration of the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, on 6 February, with the aim to enhance awareness-raising campaigns and to take concrete action against female genital mutilation, Recognizing that, like all other harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation constitutes a human rights violation and a form of violence against women and girls that is mainly motivated and perpetuated by gender inequality and discriminatory social norms that jeopardize the recognition, enjoyment and exercise of their human rights and fundamental freedoms while posing a serious threat to their health and well-being, including physical integrity and mental, sexual and reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, Recognizing also that the practice has no documented health benefits and may, on the contrary, increase the risk of sickness and death, that it causes severe stress and shock, that it may give rise to post-partum and obstetric complications such as fistula or haemorrhage, and that it is likely to increase vulnerability to HIV and hepatitis B and C and to cause other health problems, Recognizing further that all harmful practices, including female genital mutilation, when perpetrated against girl children, have particular detrimental consequences on their health and growth, and recalling in that regard the need to guarantee the right of girl children to be free from all forms of violence, Recognizing that the practice of female genital mutilation continues to have an adverse effect not on only the economic, legal, health and social status of all women and girls, but also on the development of society as a whole, while the empowerment of and investment in women and girls, the full enjoyment of their human rights and their full, equal, effective and meaningful participation at all levels of decision-making are key to breaking the cycle of gender inequality, discrimination, gender-based violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, to sustainable development, Recognizing also that harmful practices such as female genital mutilation are an impediment to the full realization of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and to the respect for, and protection and fulfilment of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and the development of their full potential as equal partners with men and boys, as well as to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, and convinced that such harmful practices seriously impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and human rights and prohibit gender- based discrimination and violence, Deeply concerned that, despite increased national, regional and international efforts, the harmful practice of female genital mutilation, like many other harmful practices, persists in all parts of the world, that it is exacerbated in humanitarian situations, armed conflicts, pandemics and other crises, and that new forms, such as medicalization and cross-border practice, are emerging, Recognizing that the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation is a national development, human rights and public health priority, thereby requiring a comprehensive and multisectoral approach based on States’ obligations under international human rights law and underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, accountability, participation, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, equality and non-discrimination, and international cooperation, A/HRC/44/L.20 Considering that holistic strategies to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation must be mainstreamed and coordinated both vertically and horizontally; that horizontal coordination requires the joint participation of organizations across sectors, including education, health, justice, social welfare, law enforcement, immigration and asylum, and communications and media, while vertical coordination brings together stakeholders at the national, subnational and local levels, including, inter alia, parliamentarians, national human rights institutions, traditional community leaders and religious authorities, women and girls, parents, legal guardians and families, health-care providers, civil society, human rights groups, youth organizations and men and boys, Recognizing that the practice constitutes torture or ill-treatment and must be prohibited, in accordance with regional and international human rights standards, Expressing deep concern about the lack of effective measures for prosecuting perpetrators, providing victims and survivors of female genital mutilation with access to remedies and redress, health care and health services, mental health and psychosocial counselling, legal assistance and socioeconomic reintegration services, Noting that human rights accountability means not only the establishment of protection measures ensuring criminal liability and the provision of legal remedies, but also the implementation of a broad range of other measures in the design, implementation and monitoring of policies, programmes and services to ensure women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights with the full, equal active and meaningful participation of women and girls at risk of and affected by female genital mutilation, Noting with concern that many countries lack accurate and reliable data on female genital mutilation to inform planning and track progress in eliminating female genital mutilation, due to the absence of indicators in administrative data systems, the absence of robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to track progress and the absence of standard guidelines on data collection, Bearing in mind the most recent global and national commitments made by States, including in the 2019 Ouagadougou call to action on eliminating female genital mutilation, and the 2019 Cairo call to action for the elimination of child marriage and female genital mutilation in Africa, to accelerate efforts to ensure the global elimination of the practice of female genital mutilation by 2030, Welcoming the growing global consensus on the need to take appropriate measures to prevent and eradicate female genital mutilation, and considering that this practice cannot be justified on religious or cultural grounds, Welcoming also initiatives, such as the Saleema initiative launched by the African Union, to galvanize political action, increase allocation of financial resources and strengthen partnerships to end female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned about studies indicating that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis could drive international, regional and national efforts away from the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation and other harmful practices, which could result in delayed programme implementation and at least 2 million additional cases of female genital mutilation that could have been averted by 2030, Reaffirming the obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and to prevent and eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation, and emphasizing in this regard the specific role of the different departments of government, the legislative branch and the judiciary at the national and subnational levels, Bearing in mind that States have primary responsibility for preventing and eliminating female genital mutilation and for achieving zero tolerance of the practice, A/HRC/44/L.20 1. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the expert group meeting on the elimination of female genital mutilation;! 2.

Also urges States to ensure the protection of and provision of support to women and girls subjected to, or at risk of, female genital mutilation and to address the underlying systemic and structural causes in which the harmful practice is rooted by establishing well- defined, comprehensive, rights-based, gender-responsive and multisectoral prevention and response strategies that include supportive legislation and policy, programme and budgetary measures based on integrated, coordinated and collective approaches combining political commitment, civil society engagement and accountability at the national, local and community levels; 4. Further urges States to ensure that national action plans and strategies on the prevention and elimination of female genital mutilation are adequately resourced and include projected timelines for goals and incorporate clear targets and indicators for the effective monitoring, impact assessment and coordination of programmes among all relevant stakeholders and promote their participation, including the participation of affected women and girls, practising communities and non-governmental organizations, in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of such plans and strategies; 5. Encourages States to put in place national coordination mechanisms to prevent and eliminate female genital mutilation and ensure their sustainability and effectiveness by recognizing, preferably by law, their convening authority and by providing them with adequate financial resources and capacities so that they can oversee the implementation of comprehensive and multisectoral strategies, national plans, policies and programmes; and mobilize relevant actors, including girls, women, parents, legal guardians and families, women’s organizations, health-care workers, youth groups, human rights groups, religious and traditional leaders, community leaders, men and boys and other members of civil society and national stakeholders as appropriate to participate in the design, implementation and monitoring of national efforts to prevent and end female genital mutilation and provide care for women and girls who have undergone female genital mutilation; 6.

The human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation,"The Human Rights Council, Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Recalling all resolutions of the General Assembly on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in particular resolution 64/292 of 28 July 2010, in which the Assembly recognized the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights, and resolution 74/141 of 18 December 2019, Reaffirming all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, Council resolution 39/8 of 27 September 2018, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Recalling also that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to the right to life and human dignity, Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that human GE.20-12836(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 rights must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis, and that it is the duty of States to promote and protect all human rights, and which also reaffirms the right to development, Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which States pledged to leave no one behind, Recalling that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development covers the issue of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also that 10 years after the recognition of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, integrated approaches that support the practical realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, particularly by tackling inequalities and ensuring special attention to the needs and rights of all women and girls, are more pertinent than ever before, also in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the need to pursue these integrated approaches to the implementation of Goal 6 and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals that reflect the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and personal hygiene, in particular for women and girls, to enable menstrual hygiene management in a dignified and healthy way, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water and to reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity, Recalling General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which the Assembly proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, Noting the work of the High-level Panel on Water, jointly convened by the United Nations and the World Bank Group, in order to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation-related services in line with Sustainable Development Goal 6 and taking note of its outcome document of 14 March 2018, Noting also the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2019 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report of the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2019, 1.6 billion people gained access to safe drinking water between 2000 and 2017 and that an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 785 million people lack a basic water service, 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.2 billion people lack access to a safely managed sanitation service and 673 million people still practise open defecation, Deeply alarmed about the fact that, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, scarcity of water could displace an estimated 700 million people by 2030, A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms by which to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Recognizing that sustained access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities is essential to preventing infectious diseases and that people without or with inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are at a much higher risk of contracting and passing on diseases, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities and that those most at risk are persons in vulnerable and marginalized situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, and gravely concerned that 3 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home, which is the most effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable and marginalized situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island developing States and the least developed countries, rural and local communities and people facing desertification, land degradation, drought and water scarcity, as well as rising water levels due to storm surges, sea level rise and flooding, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water, when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or when, A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 in the absence of adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, which limits their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, Deeply concerned also that persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities, as such facilities are often inaccessible and inappropriate for meeting their needs, which affects their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is further exacerbated in particular in the situation of homelessness, in informal settlements and in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed that water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or during natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability, and reaffirming also the importance of taking steps with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, tenure status, income levels or other related considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of achieving universal access to safe, affordable and adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030 and of adequate and new sources of funding, including innovative financing, Stressing also the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international cooperation and technical assistance, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have sustained access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and takes note with appreciation of his reports; 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and_ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals; urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach that includes menstrual health management when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; and invites regional and international organizations to complement the efforts made by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in accordance with their respective mandates; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons in vulnerable situations have equal access to effective remedies; 6. Notes with concern that, in spite of all efforts, gender inequalities still exist in the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in particular as a result of women’s and girls’ specific needs concerning menstrual hygiene and menstrual health; 7. Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law; (b) To consider making the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, a priority at the highest level in order to ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability; (c) To increase public funding and support private capital in order to make adequate funding available to the sector and to close the financing gap that hampers the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 and the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;

to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside of their home or practising open defecation; to protect women’s and girls’ equal access to water and sanitation; and to take positive measures to guarantee the availability and accessibility of these rights; A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 (f) To promote safe public spaces and improve the security and safety of all women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and infrastructure when accessing sanitation facilities and water waste collection and treatment facilities outside their homes or when collecting household water; (g) | To enhance international solidarity, cooperation and support for countries hosting large numbers of displaced persons and refugees to address their water- and sanitation-related challenges; (h) To address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by ensuring access to factual information thereon, addressing the negative social norms around the issue in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender- sensitive facilities, including options for the disposal and waste management of menstrual hygiene products, while recognizing that women’s and girls’ attendance at school, university or, for women, work, can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, public places and, for women, the workplace; (i) To take steps to promote action to raise international awareness on the issue of waterborne diseases and to mitigate the disproportionate impact of water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases on children and reduce child mortality, morbidity and stunting by ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and by engaging in partnerships with stakeholders to implement projects aimed at scaling up access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in developing countries;

States parties to pursue the full implementation of the rights of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution, and that States parties have agreed that the education of the child shall be directed to, among others, the development of respect for the natural environment, Recalling the 2016 Day of General Discussion of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which focused on the contents and the implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child with regard to environmental matters, and taking note of its

Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, A/HRC/45/L.48 Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, or primary caregivers and legal guardians, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, A/HRC/45/L.48 Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1.

States parties to pursue the full implementation of the rights of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution, and that States parties have agreed that the education of the child shall be directed to, among others, the development of respect for the natural environment, Recalling the 2016 Day of General Discussion of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which focused on the contents and the implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child with regard to environmental matters, and taking note of its outcome report and recommendations, Welcoming the attention paid by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council to the rights of the child in the context of their respective mandates, in particular the work of the Special Rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Reaffirming that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, that the best interests of the child shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his or her nurture and protection, and that families’ and caregivers’ capacities to provide the child with care and a safe environment should be promoted, including in the context of natural disasters, the adverse impacts of climate change or other forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous

of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Recalling with appreciation general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, !’ while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption and the need to discuss the right to privacy in view of the challenges of the digital age, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, based on international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies, the impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, necessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices, Recognizing also that the discussion on the right to privacy should be based upon existing international and domestic legal obligations, including international human rights law, as well as relevant commitments, and should not open the path for undue interference with an individual’s human rights, Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information and democratic participation, Recognizing that the right to privacy is important for the enjoyment of other rights and can contribute to an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, and noting with concern that violations or abuses of the right to be free from unlawful or arbitrary interference with the right to privacy might affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association, Noting that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, Expressing concern that individuals, particularly children, often do not and/or cannot provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the sale or multiple resale of their personal data, and that the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, have increased significantly in the digital age, Noting that general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee recommends that States take effective measures to prevent the unlawful retention, processing and use of personal data stored by public authorities and business enterprises, Noting also that the use of artificial intelligence can contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and has the potential to transform governments and "" Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-third Session, Supplement No. 40 (A/43/40), annex VI. 3/8 societies, economic sectors and the world of work and can also have various far- reaching implications, including with regard to the right to privacy, Noting with concern that artificial intelligence or machine-learning technologies, without proper technical, regulatory, legal and ethical safeguards, may lead to decisions that have the potential to affect the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, and affect non-discrimination, and recognizing the need to apply international human rights law and data protection frameworks in the design, evaluation and regulation of these practices, Recognizing that, while the use of artificial intelligence can have significant positive economic and social impacts, it requires and allows for the processing of large amounts of data, often relating to personal data, including biometric data and data on an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, race or ethnicity, religion or belief, which can pose serious risks to the enjoyment of the right to privacy, especially when done without proper safeguards, in particular when employed for identification, tracking, profiling, facial recognition, classification, behaviour prediction or scoring of individuals, Noting that the use of artificial intelligence may, without proper safeguards, pose the risk of reinforcing discrimination, including structural inequalities, and recognizing that racially and otherwise discriminatory outcomes should be prevented in the design, development, implementation and use of emerging digital technologies, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, hacking and the unlawful use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and the right to freedom of religion or belief and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Recognizing that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with regard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the necessary steps to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Expressing concern about the spread of disinformation and misinformation, particularly on social media platforms, which can be designed and implemented so as to mislead, to spread racism, xenophobia, negative stereotyping and stigmatization, to violate and abuse human rights, including the right to privacy, to impede freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, and to incite all forms of violence, hatred, intolerance, discrimination and hostility, and emphasizing the important contribution of journalists, civil society and academia in countering this trend, Emphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect personal data, when they share or otherwise provide access to data collected through, inter alia, information- and intelligence-sharing agreements 4/8 and when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including business enterprises, Noting the increase in the collection of sensitive biometric information from individuals, and stressing that States must comply with their human rights obligations and that business enterprises should respect the right to privacy and other human rights when collecting, processing, sharing and storing biometric information by, inter alia, considering the adoption of data protection policies and safeguards, Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption, pseudonymization and anonymity, are important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of opinion and expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and recognizing that States should refrain from employing unlawful or arbitrary surveillance techniques, which may include forms of hacking, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy, as a result of their activities, Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting also, in that respect, that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Stressing the need to address prevailing challenges to bridge the digital divides, both between and within countries, and the gender digital divide, and to harness information and communications technologies for development, and recalling the need to emphasize quality of access to bridge digital and knowledge divides, using a multidimensional approach that includes speed, stability, affordability, language, training, capacity-building, local content and accessibility for persons with disabilities, and to promote the full enjoyment of human rights, including the right to privacy, Stressing also the need to ensure that national security and public health measures, including the use of technology to monitor and contain the spread of infectious diseases, are in full compliance with the obligations of States under international human rights law and adhere to the principles of lawfulness, legality, legitimacy with regard to the aim pursued, necessity and proportionality and the need to protect human rights, including the right to privacy, and personal data in the response to health or other emergencies, Noting the importance of protecting and respecting the right of

Also emphasizes the need to develop economic recovery plans that drive change towards inclusive societies by, inter alia, targeting all women and girls, especially those who face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence, underlining that economic response, including poverty eradication measures, social assistance and protection, and fiscal and stimulus packages, must be equally accessible to all, be gender-responsive and specifically address the care sector and the issues of informal and non-standard forms of employment, and recognize and take measures to reduce and redistribute women’s and girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, and consider focusing on actions regarding financial inclusion for women, equal pay for work of equal value and career opportunities, as well as women’s leadership and female entrepreneurship and ensure women’s participation in economic activity, as this is key to sustainable economic recovery; Resolution 70/1. 3 Report of the International Conference on Population and Development, Cairo, 5-13 September 1994 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.95.XIII.18), chap.

Resolution 70/1. 2/11 pandemic are projected to result in 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that otherwise would have been averted by 2030, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering of information on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Noting with concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls, but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Noting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of education are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic independence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women can expand their options for leaving abusive relationships, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls, Recognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and 3/11 confronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the importance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that respond to their specific needs, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict, public health emergencies and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Expressing deep concern about the unprecedented and multifaceted negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of, and efforts to end, child, 4/11 early and forced marriage, including the wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences and devastating impacts of the pandemic on the livelihoods of people and families, especially women and girls, and the poorest and most vulnerable, as well as the severe disruption to health and education systems, social protection programmes and the provision of protection and support services, including essential Services, Noting with deep concern that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, are likely to increase risks faced by girls, including already married girls, as well as women affected by this harmful practice, including risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, unintended and/or early pregnancy, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the associated risk of not returning to school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services, hindering the fulfilment of their rights and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations, Expressing deep concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates root causes of child, early and forced marriage, but also diverts international, regional and national attention and resources away from, inter alia, the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices, and furthermore that COVID-19 containment measures are delaying and disrupting efforts,
