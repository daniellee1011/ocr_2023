women, migrant women and women with disabilities, and the particular risk of violence they face, and stressing the urgent need to address violence and discrimination against them, Underscoring the fact that shame, stigma, fear of reprisals and negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced household income, prevent many A/HRC/29/L.16/Rev.1 women and girls from leaving dangerous relationships, reporting or acting as witnesses in cases of domestic violence, and seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Noting with deep concern that children can also be victims of domestic violence, including as witnesses, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage places individuals, in particular the girl child, at risk of being exposed to and encountering various

violence, are exacerbated in armed conflict and humanitarian crisis situations, 1.
