be retained in perpetuity and never used is not supported by the history of human experience, and convinced that the only complete defence is the elimination of nuclear weapons and the assurance that they will never be produced again, Concerned also at the continued retention of the nuclear-weapons option by those three States that are nuclear-weapons-capable and that have not acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,' and concerned at their failure torenounce that option, Concerned further that negotiations on nuclear arms reductions are currently stalled, Bearing in mind that the overwhelming majority of States entered into legally binding commitments not to receive, manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosivedevices, and recalling that these undertakings have been made inthe context ofthe corresponding legallybinding commitments by the Nuclear-Weapon States to the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, Recalling

of nuclear weapons will be considered legitimate for the indefinite future, and convinced of the imperative to proceed with determination to prohibit and eradicate them for all time, Recognizing that the total elimination of nuclear weapons will require measures to be taken firstly by those Nuclear-Weapon States that have the largest arsenals, and stressing that these States must be joined in a seamless process by those Nuclear-Weapon States with lesser arsenals in the near future, Welcoming the achievements to date and the future promise of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks process and the

treaty banning the production offissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and considering that such a treaty must further underpin the process towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons, Emphasizing that, for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved, effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through, infer alia, the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, Emphasizing the importance of existing nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaties and of the early signature and ratification of the relevant protocols to these treaties, 2 Noting the Joint Ministerial Declaration of 9 June 1998* and its
