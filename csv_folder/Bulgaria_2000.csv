Takes note of the submission of the preliminary elements of a declaration of basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters, annexed to the present resolution; 2. Requests the Secretary-General to seek comments from Member States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as the institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network, on the desirability and the means of establishing common principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters, including the advisability of developing an instrument, such as the preliminary declaration annexed to the present resolution, and on the contents of this ; 3. Also requests the Secretary-General to convene, subject to the availability of voluntary contributions, a meeting of experts selected on the basis of equitable geographical representation to review the comments received and to examine proposals for further action in relation to restorative justice, including mediation, as well as the possibility of developing an instrument such as a declaration of basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes, taking into account the preliminary declaration annexed to the present resolution; 4.

Annex Preliminary elements of a declaration of basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters Definitions 1. “Restorative justice programme” means any programme that uses restorative processes or aims to achieve restorative outcomes. 2. “Restorative outcome” means an agreement reached as the result of a restorative process. Examples of restorative outcomes include restitution, community service and any other programme or response designed to accomplish reparation of the victim and community, and reintegration of the victim and/or the offender. 3. “Restorative process” means any process in which the victim, the offender and/or any other individuals or community members affected by a crime actively participate together in the resolution of matters arising from the crime, often with the help of a fair and impartial third party. Examples of restorative process include mediation, conferencing and sentencing circles. 4. “Parties” means the victim, the offender and any other individuals or community members affected by a crime who may be involved in a restorative justice programme. 5. “Facilitator” means a fair and impartial third party whose role is to facilitate the participation of victims and offenders in an encounter programme. E/CN.15/2000/L.2/Rev.1 II. Use of restorative justice programmes 6. Restorative justice programmes should be generally available at all stages of the criminal justice process. 7. Restorative processes should be used only with the free and voluntary consent of the parties. The parties should be able to withdraw such consent at any time during the process. Agreements should be arrived at voluntarily by the parties and contain only reasonable and proportionate obligations. 8. All parties should normally acknowledge the basic facts of a case as a basis for participation in a restorative process. Participation should not be used as evidence of admission of guilt in subsequent legal proceedings. 9. Obvious disparities with respect to factors such as power imbalances and the parties’ age, maturity or intellectual capacity should be taken into consideration in referring a case to and in conducting a restorative process. Similarly, obvious threats to any of the parties’ safety should also be considered in referring any case to and in conducting a restorative process. The views of the parties themselves about the suitability of restorative processes or outcomes should be given great deference in this consideration. 10. Where restorative processes and/or outcomes are not possible, criminal justice officials should do all they can to encourage the offender to take responsibility vis-a-vis the victim and affected communities, and reintegration of the victim and/or offender into the community. III. Operation of restorative justice programmes 11. Guidelines and standards should be established, with legislative authority when necessary, that govern the use of restorative justice programmes. Such guidelines and standards should address: (a) The conditions for the referral of cases to restorative justice programmes; (b) The handling of cases following a restorative process; (c) The qualifications, training and assessment of facilitators; (d) The administration of restorative justice programmes; (e) Standards of competence and ethical rules governing operation of restorative justice programmes. 12. Fundamental procedural safeguards should be applied to restorative justice programmes and in particular to restorative processes: (a) Theparties should have the right to legal advice before and after the restorative process and, where necessary, to translation and/or interpretation. Minors should, in addition, have the right to parental assistance; (b) Before agreeing to participate in restorative processes, the parties should be fully informed of their rights, the nature of the process and the possible consequences of their decision; (c¢) Neither the victim nor the offender should be induced by unfair means to participate in restorative processes or outcomes. E/CN.15/2000/L.2/Rev.1 13. Discussions in restorative processes should be confidential and should not be disclosed subsequently, except with the agreement of the parties. 14. Judicial discharges based on agreements arising out of restorative justice programmes should have the same status as judicial decisions or judgements and should preclude prosecution in respect of the same facts (non bis in idem). 15. Where no agreement can be made between the parties, the case should be referred back to the criminal justice authorities and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Lack of agreement may not be used as justification for a more severe sentence in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. 16. Failure to implement an agreement made in the course of a restorative process should be referred back to the restorative programme or to the criminal justice authorities and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Failure to implement the agreement may not be used as justification for a more severe sentence in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. IVv. Facilitators 17. Facilitators should be recruited from all sections of society and should generally possess good understanding of local cultures and communities. They should be able to demonstrate sound judgement and interpersonal skills necessary to conducting restorative processes. 18. Facilitators should perform their duties in an impartial manner, based on the facts of the case and on the needs and wishes of the parties. They should always respect the dignity of the parties and ensure that the parties act with respect towards each other. 19. Facilitators should be responsible for providing a safe and appropriate environment for the restorative process. They should be sensitive to any vulnerability of the parties. 20. Facilitators should receive initial training before taking up facilitation duties and should also receive in-service training. The training should aim at providing skills in conflict resolution, taking into account the particular needs of victims and offenders, at providing basic knowledge of the criminal justice system and at providing a thorough knowledge of the operation of the restorative programme in which they will do their work. Continuing development of restorative justice programmes 21. There should be regular consultation between criminal justice authorities and administrators of restorative justice programmes to develop a common understanding of restorative processes and outcomes, to increase the extent to which restorative programmes are used and to explore ways in which restorative approaches might be incorporated into criminal justice practices. 22. Member States should promote research on and evaluation of restorative justice programmes to assess the extent to which they result in restorative outcomes, serve as an alternative to the criminal justice process and provide positive outcomes for all parties. 23. Restorative justice processes may need to undergo change in concrete form over time. Member States should therefore encourage regular, rigorous evaluation and modification of such programmes in the light of the above definitions.",04/18/2000,2000_423370,Bulgaria,N/A,yes

We recommend that item be considered directly in the plenary meeting. Pursuant to rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly we attach an explanatory memorandum (annex I)",N/A,Signed) Vladimir C. Sotirov,"Minister Plenipotentiary Chargé d’affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Bulgaria to the United Nations (Signed) Walter Balzan Ambassador Permanent Representative of Malta to the United Nations (Signed) Janusz Stanczyk Ambassador Permanent Representative of Poland to the United Nations (Signed) Peter Tomka Ambassador Permanent Representative of Slovakia to the United Nations (Signed) Ernest Petri¢ Ambassador Permanent Representative of Slovenia to the United Nations A/55/238 Annex | Explanatory memorandum Solidarity was recognized in the United Nations Millennium Declaration (General Assembly resolution 55/2) as one of the fundamental values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century. The Declaration also states that global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice and that those who suffer most or who benefit least will receive help from those who benefit most. Founded 20 years ago, the “Solidarity” social movement, whose significance for the world has been acknowledged, notably in the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to its legendary leader, Lech Walesa, and which was indeed based on solidarity ideals, became a great driving force for change, not only in Poland but also in the broader context, which ultimately toppled the Berlin Wall and led to the revival of democracy behind the Iron Curtain. This movement also contributed to directing the attention of people on all continents to the increasing importance of solidarity as an essential value in relations between individuals, peoples and nations. Solidarity is not only a requirement of a moral nature, but also a precondition of the efficiency of the policies of individual countries and peoples. It is one of the guarantees of peace in the world. We are living in a period of widening gaps between the rich and the poor. Authentic progress will not be possible without cooperation between all nations and peoples in overcoming poverty and without solidarity with the have-nots. We must take a positive responsibility for those who cannot assure themselves of sufficient resources for development, whose human rights are not observed and whose dignity is not respected. They are our common concern. Let the twenty-first century, therefore, be an age of nations, peoples and individuals committed to solidarity. The lonely road leads inescapably to isolation. Supranational structures, founded precisely on the principle of solidarity but respecting local distinctiveness and cultural diversity, hold out the prospect of full and stable development. The proclamation of 31 August as the International Day of Solidarity, coinciding as it does with the anniversary of the birth of the “Solidarity” movement, which inspired and paved the way to the aforementioned changes, would help to promote and strengthen the ideals of solidarity as values essential to relations within and among nations, peoples and individuals. The proclamation of this day would contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration. Solidarity has various dimensions and finds shape in various planes, which is why the proposed resolution of the General Assembly indicates the possibility of commemorating the day in a variety of ways and by a variety of means according to local, regional and international needs. A/55/238 Annex I1 Draft resolution Proclamation of 31 August as the International Day of Solidarity The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 55/2 of 8 September 2000, entitled “United Nations Millennium Declaration”, in which it recognized solidarity as one of the fundamental values essential to international relations in the twenty-first century, Reaffirming its conviction, as it has been expressed by heads of State and Government in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, that global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice, Mindful of the need for the implementation of the Millennium Declaration, Emphasizing the importance of solidarity as a moral means of establishing a just and lasting peace in accordance with the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,! Recognizing the role of solidarity in the strengthening of international cooperation and mutual understanding, Recalling that on 31 August, twenty years ago, the independent “Solidarity” movement was born in Poland and, being based on solidarity ideals, proved to be an important driving force for change that ultimately in an international plane toppled the Berlin Wall and led to the revival of democracy behind the Iron Curtain, Being aware that only when nations, peoples and individuals base their relations on solidarity ideals, humanity might be saved from wars, bridging the gap between the rich and the poor will be facilitated and respect for human rights and dignity enhanced, 1. Proclaims 31 August as the International Day of Solidarity in order to promote and strengthen the ideals of solidarity within and among nations, peoples and individuals; 2. Urges Governments and national, regional and international organizations to take appropriate steps to observe the International Day of Solidarity and to extend their full cooperation to civil societies and individuals in observing that day. 1 Resolution 2625 (XXV), annex.",11/15/2000,2000_427313,Bulgaria,N/A,yes
