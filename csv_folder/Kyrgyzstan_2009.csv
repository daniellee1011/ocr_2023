Mongolia, the Republic of India, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoy the status of SCO observer States. The charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization reaffirms the adherence of the member States to the goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as well as principles and norms of international law concerning maintenance of international peace, security and development of good-neighbourly and friendly relations as well as cooperation between States. Goals of the Organization: ¢ To strengthen mutual trust, friendship and good-neighbourliness between the member States. «To encourage efficient cooperation in such spheres as politics, trade and economy, science and technology, culture, education, energy, transport, environment and others. ¢ To consolidate efforts in maintaining and ensuring peace, security and stability in the region, building a democratic, fair and rational political and economic international order. The Council of Heads of the SCO member States is the SCO supreme governing body. It determines priorities and major areas of the Organization’s activities, decides on the fundamental issues of its internal arrangement and functioning, cooperation with other States and international organizations and considers the most urgent international problems. To implement the goals and tasks embodied in the SCO charter, the following bodies have been established: the Council of Heads of Government (Prime Ministers) of SCO member States, which approves the budget of the organization, considers and decides upon main issues pertaining to particular, especially economic, fields of development of cooperation within the Organization; the Council of SCO Foreign Ministers; and the Meetings of Heads of Ministries and Agencies of SCO member States (including ministers responsible for foreign trade, transport, education, culture, defence, etc.). Regular meetings of heads of law enforcement and Customs agencies, supreme and arbitration judges and attorneys general are conducted. There are committees of senior officials and expert working groups active within the Meetings of Heads of Ministries and Agencies. The Council of National Coordinators of SCO members States is the body that coordinates the Organization’s current activities, cooperation between the ministries and agencies of SCO member States. A/64/141 The following standing bodies of the Organization have been functioning since January 2004: ¢ The SCO secretariat in Beijing. Since 1 January 2007, Mr. Bolat Nurgaliev, Representative of the Republic of Kazakhstan, has been holding the post of Secretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. «The Executive Committee of the SCO Regional Anti-terrorist Structure in Tashkent.

Permanent representatives of the SCO member States are appointed to the secretariat and the Executive Committee of the SCO Regional Anti-terrorist Structure. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization has enjoyed observer status with the United Nations General Assembly since 2004. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization cooperates closely with the United Nations system on most of its major areas of activity. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is its principal partner. Likewise, the prospects for joint work with the United Nations system in environmental protection, humanitarian and migration spheres look very promising. A memorandum of understanding was signed between SCO and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in January 2008 in order to strengthen the institutional framework of cooperation between the Organization and United Nations bodies. Thus, favourable starting conditions have been created for mutually beneficial cooperation between the United Nations and SCO. However, it is obvious that in order to enhance the practical component of this cooperation and ensure its synergy for the purpose of addressing common tasks in the socio-economic field, it is necessary to make relations between the Organization and the United Nations more systematic.

Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;® 2.

Reaffirms that the Commission for Social Development continues to have the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly and that it serves as the main United Nations forum for an intensified global dialogue on social development issues, and calls upon Member States, the relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system and civil society to enhance their support for its work; 5. | Expresses deep concern that the world financial and economic crisis, world food and energy crises, and continuing food insecurity and climate change, as well as the lack of results so far in the multilateral trade negotiations and a loss of confidence in the international economic system, have negative implications for social development, in particular for the achievement of poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all, and social integration; 6. | Recognizes that poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration are interrelated, and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment therefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously; 7. Also recognizes that the broad concept of social development affirmed by the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly has been weakened in national and _ international policymaking and that, while poverty eradication is a central part of development policy and discourse, further attention should be given to the other commitments agreed to at the Summit, in particular those concerning employment and social integration, which have also suffered from a general disconnect between economic and social policymaking; A/C.3/64/L.9/Rev.1 8. | Acknowledges that the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), launched after the World Summit for Social Development, has provided the long-term vision for sustained and concerted efforts at the national and international levels to eradicate poverty; 9.

Also emphasizes that poverty eradication policies should attack poverty by addressing its root and structural causes and manifestations, and that equity and the reduction of inequalities need to be incorporated in those policies; 12. Stresses that an enabling environment is a critical precondition for achieving equity and social development and that, while economic growth is essential, entrenched inequality and marginalization are an obstacle to the broad- based and sustained growth required for sustainable, inclusive, people-centred development, and recognizes the need to balance and ensure complementarity between measures to achieve growth and measures to achieve economic and social equity in order for there to be an impact on overall poverty levels; 13. Also stresses that stability in global financial systems and corporate social responsibility and accountability, as well as national economic policies that have an impact on other stakeholders, are essential in creating an enabling international environment to promote economic growth and social development; 14. Recognizes the need to promote respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to address the most pressing social needs of people living in poverty, including through the design and development of appropriate mechanisms to strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and governance; 15. Reaffirms the commitment to the empowerment of women and gender equality, as well as to the mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all development efforts, recognizing that these are critical for achieving sustainable development and for efforts to combat hunger, poverty and disease and to strengthen policies and programmes that improve, ensure and broaden the full participation of women in all spheres of political, economic, social and cultural life, as equal partners, and to improve their access to all resources needed for the full exercise of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms by removing persistent barriers, 9 Report of the International Conference on Financing for Development, Monterrey, Mexico, 18-22 March 2002 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.02.1I.A7), chap.

Takes note with interest of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 10 June 2008 of the International Labour Organization Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization,° which acknowledges the particular role of the Organization in promoting a fair globalization and its responsibility to assist its members in their efforts, and the adoption of the ILO Global Jobs Pact’ in June 2009; 18. Reaffirms that there is an urgent need to create an environment at the national and international levels that is conducive to the attainment of full and productive employment and decent work for all as a foundation for sustainable development and that an environment that supports investment, growth and entrepreneurship is essential to the creation of new job opportunities, and also reaffirms that opportunities for men and women to obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity are essential to ensuring the eradication of hunger and poverty, the improvement of economic and social well-being for all, the achievement of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of all nations and a fully inclusive and equitable globalization; 19.

Calls upon the organizations of the United Nations system to commit to mainstreaming the goal of full and productive employment and decent work for all in their policies, programmes and activities; 22.

Also recognizes that full and productive employment and decent work for all, which encompass social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work, tripartism and social dialogue, are key elements of sustainable development for all countries and are therefore a priority objective of international cooperation; 25.

Also stresses the need to allocate adequate resources for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women in the workplace, including unequal access to labour market participation and wage inequalities, as well as reconciliation of work and private life for both women and men; 27.

Also recognizes the importance of providing social protection schemes for both the formal and informal economy as instruments to achieve equity, inclusion, and stability and cohesion of societies and emphasizes the importance of supporting national efforts aimed at bringing informal workers into the formal economy; 33. Further recognizes that the social integration of people living in poverty should encompass addressing and meeting their basic human needs, including nutrition, health, water, sanitation, housing and access to education and employment, through integrated development strategies; 34. Reaffirms that social integration policies should seek to reduce inequalities, promote access to basic social services, education for all and health care, increase the participation on equal terms and integration of social groups, particularly youth, older persons and persons with disabilities, and address the challenges posed by globalization and market-driven reforms to social development in order for all people in all countries to benefit from globalization; 35. Urges Governments, with the cooperation of relevant entities, to develop systems of social protection and to extend or broaden, as appropriate, their effectiveness and coverage, including for workers in the informal economy, recognizing the need for social protection systems to provide social security and support labour-market participation, and invites the International Labour Organization to strengthen its social protection strategies, including assistance to countries in building social protection floors and policies on extending social security coverage, and also urges Governments, while taking account of national circumstances, to focus on the needs of those living in, or vulnerable to, poverty and give particular consideration to universal access to basic social security systems; 36. Requests the United Nations system to support national efforts to achieve social development, in particular in fostering social integration at the local, national, regional and international levels, in a coherent, coordinated and results-based manner; 37.

Recognizes the need to formulate social development policies in an integral, articulated and participative manner, recognizing poverty as a multidimensional phenomenon, calls for interlinked public policies on this matter, and underlines the need for public policies to be included in a comprehensive development and well-being strategy; 15 Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.IV.13), chap.

Mahiga Ambassador Permanent Representative of the United Republic of Tanzania to the United Nations A/64/233 Annex I Explanatory memorandum 1. The relevance and magnitude of international migration and the growing awareness of its importance in the economic, social, cultural or humanitarian debates within the United Nations framework led to the granting of observer status to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) by the General Assembly in 1992 (resolution 47/4), to the inclusion of IOM by the Assembly as a “standing invitee” in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee for the coordination of humanitarian assistance the same year, and to the signature of the Cooperation Agreement between the United Nations and IOM in 1996. The Assembly, in its resolution 51/148 of 13 December 1996 on cooperation between the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration, took note with satisfaction of the conclusion of the Agreement; invited the Secretary-General to ensure that the needed cooperation and liaison between the secretariats of the two organizations was undertaken in order to ensure complementary actions; requested the Secretary- General, in consultation with the Director-General of IOM, to foster systematic consultations; and invited the specialized agencies and other organizations, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to cooperate with the Secretary- General and the Director-General of IOM in order to initiate, maintain and increase consultation and programmes with IOM. 2. In resolution 51/148, however, the General Assembly did not establish a systematic and periodic reporting on IOM/United Nations cooperation, a practice in place for several other non-United Nations organizations. The initiative presented in the present explanatory memorandum is meant to fill this gap without adding to the number of reports submitted to the Assembly, as the reports on cooperation with non-United Nations organizations are consolidated into one report. 3. Since the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement, in fact, the level and range of cooperation between the United Nations system and IOM has increased and diversified, covering both policy and operational levels. Similarly, over the last 12 years, States and other stakeholders have become increasingly aware of the challenges and opportunities presented by international migration. For these reasons, the establishment of a United Nations/IOM reporting mechanism would be useful, timely and constructive. 4. The collaboration of IOM with the United Nations system and its agencies has been further strengthened by the conclusion of memorandums of understanding with several departments, funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and, inter alia, by the membership in the Global Migration Group, a 14-member inter-agency group, meeting at the level of heads of agencies, which aims to promote the wider application of all relevant international and regional instruments and norms relating to migration, and the provision of more coherent and stronger leadership to improve policy and operational responses. This increasing operational collaboration that has evolved over the past decade and a half between IOM and a broadening range of United Nations entities has resulted in more frequent ad hoc inclusion of IOM in relevant United Nations processes. This has especially been the case in emergency and/or post-conflict rehabilitation situations, but also extends to a number of development-oriented initiatives and partnerships. A/64/233 5. A score of non-United Nations organizations which have been granted the status of Permanent Observer to the United Nations are part of periodic reporting arrangements in the General Assembly. The areas of cooperation between those reporting organizations and the United Nations system are outlined and described in biennial consolidated reports prepared and submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary-General under the title “Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations”. 6. The resolution in annex II contemplates the establishment of a biennial IOM/United Nations reporting mechanism as part of the above-mentioned report, which would recognize the increasing cooperation that already exists between the two organizations while in no way changing the nature of the current institutional relationship. 7. In the light of the above, it would be of particular importance if the General Assembly would request the Secretary-General to include in his report on cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations a section on cooperation between the United Nations and IOM.

A/C.3/64/L.20/Rev.1 violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful traditional practices, such as female infanticide, child and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned further that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice that affects between 100 and 140 million women and girls alive today, and that each year over three million girls are at risk of undergoing the harmful procedure, Deeply concerned that the goal set out in “A world fit for children” of ending female genital mutilation by 2010 will go unmet, Deeply concerned also that, in situations of poverty, war and armed conflict, girl children are among those most affected and furthermore become the victims of sexual violence, abuse and exploitation and sexually transmitted infections and diseases, including HIV and AIDS, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Emphasizing that increased access to education, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, for young people, especially girls, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases, in particular HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases, Concerned by the increasing number of child-headed households, in particular those headed by orphaned girls, including those orphaned by the HIV and AIDS pandemic, Deeply concerned that early childbearing and limited access to sexual and reproductive health care, including in the area of emergency obstetric care, causes high levels of obstetric fistula and maternal mortality and morbidity, Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and can be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and limitation or denial of their human rights, Recognizing that early childbearing continues to be an impediment to the improvement of the educational and social status of girls in all parts of the world and that, overall, child and forced marriages and early motherhood can severely curtail their educational opportunities and are likely to have a long-term, adverse impact on their employment opportunities and on their, and their children’s, quality of life, Noting with concern that in some areas of the world men outnumber women as a result, in part of harmful attitudes and practices, such as female genital mutilation, son preference, which results in female infanticide and prenatal sex selection, early marriage, including child marriage, violence against women, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and discrimination against girls in food allocation and in other practices related to health and well-being, resulting in fewer girls than boys surviving into adulthood, A/C.3/64/L.20/Rev.1 Taking note with appreciation of the adoption of the Rio de Janeiro Declaration and Call for Action to Prevent and Stop Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, which is the outcome document of the Third World Congress against the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents, held in Rio de Janeiro, in November 2008, 1.
