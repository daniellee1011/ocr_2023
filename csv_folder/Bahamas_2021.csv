initiatives such as the Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action, Conscious that change in the Earth’s climate, and the ensuing adverse effects, have led to economic, social, cultural and environmental consequences and have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective promotion and protection of human rights and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and to mitigate and adapt to its adverse impact, and the protection of the environment, contribute to human well-being and to the better enjoyment of human rights, as well as to sustainable development, Recognizing also that, while the human rights implications of the adverse impact of climate change affect individuals and communities around the world, especially in developing countries, in particular small island developing States, least developed countries and landlocked developing States, the consequences most acutely affect women, children, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, local communities, peasants and other people working in rural areas, people living in conditions of water scarcity, drought and desertification, persons belonging to minority groups, homeless persons, persons living in poverty, older persons, migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons, those living in conflict areas and those already in vulnerable situations, and the importance of recognizing their agency in contributing to

Rights Council, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, Noting that implementation of the commitments made under the United Nations Framework

development, Reaffirming Human Rights Council resolution 40/11, in which the Council recognized the contribution of human rights defenders, including women and indigenous human rights defenders, working in environmental matters, referred to as environmental human rights defenders, to the enjoyment of human rights, environmental protection and sustainable development, urging all States to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of the rights and safety of all persons, including environmental human rights defenders, and underscoring the responsibility of all business enterprises, both transnational and others, consistent with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, to respect human rights, including the rights to life, liberty and security of human rights defenders, including environmental human rights defenders, Considering that the impact of climate change, the unsustainable management and use of natural resources, the pollution of air, land and water, the unsound management of chemicals and waste, the resulting loss of biodiversity and the decline in services provided by ecosystems may interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, that environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights, and that, henceforth, these issues

of the child carried out by all relevant organs, bodies, entities and organizations of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates, by relevant mandate holders and special procedures of the United Nations and by relevant regional organizations, where appropriate, and intergovernmental organizations, and recognizing the valuable role of national human rights institutions and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, Recognizing the importance of international, regional and bilateral multi-stakeholder partnerships and initiatives to advance the effective protection and promotion of the rights of the child and the elimination of all forms of violence against children, including all violent punishment of children, Urging all States to respect, protect and fulfil the right of children, including children with disabilities and children in vulnerable situations, to express themselves freely and their right to be heard, to ensure that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, that their views are given due weight and that they are included in decision-making processes, in accordance with their evolving capacities or age and maturity, in all matters affecting them, including those relating to relevant aspects of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while recognizing also the importance of involving children’s organizations and child-led initiatives, Concerned about the occurrence of bullying and cyberbullying in all parts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may be at heightened risk of compromising their health, emotional well-being and education and for a wide range of physical and/or mental health conditions, as well as potential long-term effects on the individual’s ability to realize his or her own potential, Deeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of discrimination, exclusion and inequality and that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of poverty and inequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is one of the greatest global challenges and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, recognizing the impact of poverty beyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable development, and in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence and to promote the resilience of children, their families and their communities, Recognizing that girls are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, including sexual violence, and forced labour, which, among other things, would hinder the realization of their rights and efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and the empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and 4/17 effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing further that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, Expressing serious concern that children with disabilities, particularly girls, face stigmatization, discrimination or exclusion and are disproportionately subjected to mental and physical violence and sexual abuse in all settings, Reaffirming that the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States parties to pursue the full implementation of the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through ensuring access to health-care services, the provision of adequate nutritious food and clean drinking water, hygiene and sanitation, and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Reaffirming also the need to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, and recognizing that infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, remain a leading cause of death in children under 5, along with pre-term birth and intrapartum-related complications, Recognizing that the risk of maternal mortality is highest for girls under 15 years of age and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among girls under 15 years of age in many countries, Profoundly concerned that children, particularly in early childhood, in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, including persistent drought, natural disasters such as extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity and pollution, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and in this regard calling for the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,* Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling the importance of promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrant children, regardless of their migration status, with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration; reaffirming all latest international policy developments and relevant United Nations agreements in this regard; and strengthening international and regional cooperation, within the framework of the United Nations and relevant regional forums, Recognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the greatest global challenges in the history of the United Nations, and noting with deep concern its disproportionately heavy impact, inter alia, on children, and its impact on health and the loss of life, mental health and well-being, as well as the negative impact on global humanitarian needs and the enjoyment of human rights and across all spheres of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, and education, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, trade, societies and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social inequalities 517 within and among countries, which is reversing hard-won development gains and hampering progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and all its Goals and targets, Deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children, including on their access to essential health-care services, and about the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the largest ever mass disruption to education systems across the world, forcing school closures in more than 190 countries and affecting 90 per cent of the world’s students at its peak, with an estimated 7.6 million girls at risk of not returning to school and an estimated 370 million children missing out on free or subsidized school meals, and noting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in schools, and that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and reduce absenteeism, Recognizing also that there is increased reliance on virtual learning, with more than 90 per cent of Governments enacting policies to provide digital or broadcast learning, and that, while recalling Committee on the Rights of the Child general comment No. 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment,> meaningful access to digital technologies can support children to realize the full range of their rights, as has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges faced by children in accessing the Internet and digital devices can limit their right to education, and increase inequalities among and within countries, with children living in rural areas and from the poorest households being the most affected, Stressing that new information and communications technologies and applications can create new ways to enhance education and foster learning and teaching on the rights of the child and can be useful tools to promote children’s rights and protection, and in that regard stressing the need to enhance efforts to expand connectivity and digital learning and bridge the digital divide, including the gender digital divide, while protecting children from violence in the digital environment, Deeply concerned that increased unsupervised use of the Internet, inter alia, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has exacerbated children’s exposure to the risk of all forms of violence, including in digital contexts, inter alia, sexual harassment, peer-to-peer sexual harassment and cyberbullying, child sexual exploitation and abuse, child grooming, trafficking in persons, hate speech, stigmatization, racism, xenophobia and discrimination, Reiterating the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda and that a strong focus is needed on combating poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all violations and abuses and to promote the rights of children, and the importance of promoting education, including early childhood education, 1. Recognizes that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the human rights treaty with the largest number of ratifications, and acknowledges that the Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto contain a comprehensive set of international legal standards for the protection and well-being of children; 2. Calls upon States parties to increase their efforts for the full implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; 3. Reaffirms paragraphs 1, 4 and 5 of its resolution 71/177 of 19 December 2016 and that the general principles of, inter alia, the best interests of the child, 6/17 non-discrimination, participation and survival and development provide the framework for all actions concerning children; 4.

Takes note with appreciation of the work of the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and for Children and Armed Conflict, the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, and the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and, in this regard, their contribution to the progress achieved in the promotion and protection of the rights of children; 7. Reaffirms section I of its resolution 74/133, on children without parental care, in which it addressed, inter alia, the economic and social well-being of children; the right to education; promoting and protecting the rights of children, including children in particularly difficult situations, including children with disabilities; migrant children; children affected by armed conflict; children facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination; the human rights of children in alternative care; the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective; and children who are victims of trafficking; 8. Calls upon States to ensure the enjoyment by all children of all their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination of any kind; 9. Notes with concern the large number of children belonging to national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, migrant children, refugee or asylum- seeking children, internally displaced children, children with disabilities, children of African descent and indigenous children who are victims of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, stresses the need to incorporate special measures, in accordance with the principle of the best interests of the child and respect for their views and the child’s gender-specific needs, including children with disabilities, into education and programmes to combat these practices, and calls upon States to provide special support and to ensure equal access to services for those children and their effective protection; 10.
