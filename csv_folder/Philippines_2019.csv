post-conflict settings, and that gaps need to be addressed, Recognizing that women and girls undertake a disproportionate share of unpaid and domestic work and that policies and initiatives that

welcoming in this regard the commitment of Member States to respond to the specific needs of Africa, Acknowledging the remarkable progress seen in global malaria control between 2000 and 2015, during which mortality decreased in South-East Asia by 44 per cent, in Africa by 37 per cent and in the Americas by 27 per cent, but noting with concern the trend of stalling mortality rates in some countries and that the global malaria community needs to increase its focus on supporting countries where malaria elimination will be hardest, Recognizing that continued scale-up of integrated community case management of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea in children under 5 years of age in the highest burden countries, and a strengthening of integrated delivery systems for malaria prevention tools, would be a cost-effective solution to help in bridging systems gaps until health systems are further strengthened,’ while also helping to reach populations at highest risk of malaria, Recalling that the target for malaria reduction under Millennium Development Goal 6 had been achieved, with the incidence rate decreasing by 18 per cent globally, from 76 to 63 cases per

per cent decline in malaria case incidence and a 66 per cent decline in malaria death rates between 2000 and 2015,!° Acknowledging the progress made in parts of Africa in reversing the high burden of malaria through political engagement and sustainable national malaria control programmes, as well as the success achieved in respect of the 2015 goals concerning malaria control set by the World Health Assembly, the RBM Partnership to End Malaria and the Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa, ® Acknowledging also the progress made in Latin America in reducing the incidence of malaria, with 15 out of 21 countries reducing the incidence by 75 per cent by 2015, and in significantly decreasing the number of malaria deaths by 79 per cent since 2000, owing to the commitment of countries to improving access to medicines and health services and to sustained efforts in prevention programmes, Recognizing that, despite the fact that increased global and national investments in malaria control have yielded significant results in decreasing the burden of malaria in many countries, and that some countries are moving towards the elimination of malaria, many countries continue to have unacceptably high burdens of malaria and, in order to reach the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, must rapidly increase malaria prevention and control efforts, which rely heavily on medicines and insecticides whose utility is continuously threatened by the development of resistance to antimalarial agents, as well as resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides and their shift to outdoor biting and resting, Aware that recent successes in prevention and control are fragile and can be maintained only with sufficient and sustained national and international investment to fund global malaria control efforts fully, Regretting the high number of people still without access to medicines, and underscoring that improving access to medicines could save millions of lives every year, Recognizing the serious challenges relating to substandard and falsified medical products, poor malaria diagnostics and poor quality of vector control products, Expressing concern about the continued morbidity, mortality and debility attributed to malaria, and recalling that more efforts are needed as countries implement the Sustainable Development Goals and focus on targets set out in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 and the Action and Investment to Defeat Malaria 2016—2030 plan to reduce malaria mortality rates by 90 per cent by 2030, Aware that a concerted and coordinated global effort will be needed to substantially reduce malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality by 2030 and achieve the targets set in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, Recognizing that progress can be accelerated through a multi-pronged response by expanding currently available life-saving interventions, making malaria a higher political priority and considering malaria control as an integrated part of the health system, increasing accountability, strengthening regional and _ cross-border collaboration, and ensuring that the development and use of new tools and approaches are maximized, Gravely concerned about the health burden of malaria worldwide, with 219 million cases and 435,000 deaths reported in
