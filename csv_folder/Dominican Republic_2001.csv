Notes with concern the persistence of the external debt problem, that the vicious cycle of debt and underdevelopment has become further entrenched, that debt service has grown at a much greater rate than the debt itself and that the burden of payments has become heavier in many developing countries, including those with low and middle incomes, despite repeated rescheduling, and that the current debt and poverty reduction and growth initiatives lack sufficient funding and have several conditions attached; 4. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session (resolution S-24/2, of 1 July 2000, annex, chap. ]) to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 5. Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based, inter alia, in open, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, predictable, transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems, which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 6.

Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 10.

Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the 12. 16. population in the affected countries; 17. Recognizes that there is a need for more transparency, participation by all States and consideration of the relevant resolutions of the Commission in the deliberations and 17. activities of international and regional financial institutions; 18.

I, sect. C. Considering that older women have suffered from past discrimination and lack of opportunity and that in many countries the plight of older women is becoming more serious, Recognizing that the risk of impoverishment, particularly in old age, is greater for women because social security schemes are based on a history of continuous remunerated employment and older women have often spent their lives in unremunerated caregiving or in informal labour activity, and that in this regard women have also faced lifelong discrimination in respect of entering and functioning in the formal labour market, Concerned that lower educational opportunities available to women hinder their full participation in the public and political life of their country throughout the age continuum, Concerned also that post-menopausal conditions and diseases have been neglected in research, academic studies, public policy and service provision, and that the quality of life of older women is therefore in danger, Recognizing that the interrelationship of ageing and disability among women needs special attention, since lifelong neglect of women’s health, social condition, poor nutrition and hard physical labour leaves them at and after menopause especially vulnerable to the risks of disabilities, Aware that statistics are an essential ingredient of planning and policy evaluation and that few statistics are available on the situation of older women, Calling attention to the urgent need to develop and improve the publication of statistics by gender and age, and to identify and evaluate the different forms of activities of older women, which are not normally recognized as having an economic value, in particular in the informal sector, Believing that it is critical to mainstream the needs and concerns of older women into the planning process at all levels, Emphasizing the consequent need to adopt an approach for the advancement of women that takes into account all stages of life, so as to identify measures that respond to women’s needs and human rights, 1. Notes with appreciation the valuable contributions that non-governmental organizations have made in calling attention to the specific needs of older women and encourages them to continue to cooperate with the international community on behalf of these women,; 2. Invites international development agencies and organizations, including the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme, to take account of the potential of older women as a human resource for development, to include older women in their development strategies and programmes, and to encourage Governments to ensure the inclusion of women, regardless of age, in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions; 3. Urges, that the special problems faced by older women, such as income security, education, employment, housing, health and community support services, should be given explicit and full attention by the Second World Assembly on Ageing A/C.3/56/L.21 to be held in Madrid in April 2002, and should be dealt with in the International Plan of Action on Ageing to be adopted by the Second World Assembly; 4. Invites the Second World Assembly on Ageing to therefore include in its agenda an item entitled “Discrimination on grounds of age and gender”; 5. Recommends that older women should be accorded a respected role in society, which would reduce their isolation and permit their full participation in society, including participation in the development of policies and programmes that affect their well-being; 6. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that in all future reports on the question of ageing, data are presented and analysed by gender and age, and that information is included on the needs and risks of older and very much older persons, most of whom are disadvantaged older women; 7. Recommends that, within existing budgetary resources or, where necessary, with the help of extrabudgetary or voluntary resources, the concerned specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system provide to the bodies responsible for the advancement of women, information that would enable them to undertake a precise and in-depth analysis of the situation of older women, including developing, if necessary, specific new methods for data collection; 8. Requests, therefore, that appropriate resources be invested in research and data collection on the situation of older women, to provide the basis for development of policies and implementation of programmes that recognize and reflect the past, present and future contributions of older women and that address the needs of older women relating to economic and social security, education and appropriate health-care services; 9. Invites relevant research and training institutions for the advancement of women of the United Nations, in cooperation with the regional commissions, to pay special attention to older women in their efforts to improve methodology for data- gathering on women; 10. Urges Governments, in cooperation with the non-governmental organizations concerned, to strengthen activities for the benefit of older women, taking better account of their specific needs; 11. Requests that the results of data collection and research on older women be widely disseminated in order to effect positive changes in policy development and programme implementation for all women of all ages.",10/25/2001,2001_451134,Dominican Republic,N/A,yes
