Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that more than 6 million children still die every year from hunger-related illnesses before their fifth birthday, that there are at least 963 million undernourished people in the world and that, while the prevalence of hunger has diminished, the absolute number of undernourished people has been increasing in recent years, when, according to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the planet could produce enough food to feed 12 billion people, twice the world’s present population; 4. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 5. Encourages States, in accordance with their relevant obligations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 6.

Calls upon States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to fulfil their obligations under article 2, paragraph 1, and article 11, paragraph 2, in particular with regard to the right to adequate food; 11. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 12. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes, that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers, and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is an element key to food security and provision of the right to food; 13. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa; 14. Also stresses its commitments to promote and protect, without discrimination, the economic, social and cultural rights of indigenous peoples, in accordance with international human rights obligations and taking into account, as appropriate, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous communities have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face for the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 15. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 16. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon request and in cooperation with affected countries, towards a better realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or natural or man-made disasters affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 17. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 18. Takes note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food (A/HRC/10/5), which examines how development cooperation and food aid policies could make a contribution to the realization of the right to food everywhere; 19. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue cooperating with States in order to enhance the contribution of development cooperation and food aid to the realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all stakeholders; 20. Stresses that all States should make every effort to ensure that their international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 21. Takes note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food on his mission to the World Trade Organization (A/HRC/10/5/Add.2), and encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to engage with the World Trade Organization to follow up on the issues of concern identified in his report; 22. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty; 23. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, and invites once again all Governments, international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium Declaration; 24. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 25. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 26. Stresses the importance of international development cooperation and assistance, in particular in activities related to disaster risk reduction and in emergency situations such as natural and man-made disasters, diseases and pests, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 27. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 28. Encourages the Special Rapporteur on the right to food and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises to cooperate on the subject of the contribution of the private sector to the realization of the right to food, including the importance of ensuring sustainable water resources for human consumption and agriculture; 29. Recognizes the negative impact on the full enjoyment of the right to adequate food of insufficient purchasing power and of increased volatility of prices of agricultural commodities on the international markets, particularly on people in developing countries and on net-food importing countries; 30. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as extended for a period of three years by the Council in its resolution 6/2 of 27 September 2007; 31. Requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to provide all the necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 32. Welcomes the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (art. 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and the international levels, oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all; 33.

Reaffirms that the Voluntary Guidelines to support the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the context of national food security represent a practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the achievement of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration; 35.

Takes note with appreciation of the proposed elements for a conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between foreign debt and human rights, and encourages the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights to continue to develop them with a view to addressing the debt crisis in a just, equitable and sustainable manner; 3. | Welcomes the areas of focus identified by the independent expert for the period 2009-2010, in particular the development of the general guidelines on foreign debt and human rights and the issue of illegitimate debt, and in that regard calls on the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist the independent expert in the organization and holding of regional consultations on these issues, including through the allocation of sufficient budgetary resources; 4. Recalls that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, social and cultural development of its people, and to that end has the right and responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 5. Recognizes that structural-adjustment reform programmes limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 6. Affirms that the current global financial and economic crises should not result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop debt relief measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human rights in affected countries; 7. Expresses its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long-term debt burden; 8. Reiterates its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 9. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of middle-income and low-income heavily indebted countries, and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor in them, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, and by armed conflicts; 10. Acknowledges that, in least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals regarding development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 11. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; 12. Recalls once again the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 13. Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 14. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 15. Stresses the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and ina consistent way, in the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of human rights; 16. Also stresses that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights; 17. Further stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 18. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting ongoing programmes; 19. Calls upon creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and debtors alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to development projects, loan agreements or Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers; 20. Reaffirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 21. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS, so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 22. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 23. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 24. Requests the independent expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 25. Also requests the independent expert to continue to seek the views and suggestions of States, international organizations, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, regional economic commissions, international and regional financial institutions and non-governmental organizations on the general guidelines and his proposal of possible elements for consideration and urges them to respond to his requests; 26. Encourages the independent expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Council and its Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, in his work towards the elaboration of the general guidelines; 27. Requests the independent expert to report to the General Assembly on the issue of the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 28. Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular all the staff and resources required to carry out his functions; 29. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 30. Requests the independent expert to submit an analytical report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Council in 2009 in accordance with its annual programme of work, and to submit a progress report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session; 31.

resolutions 2005/84, 2003/47, 2001/51 and 1999/49, the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS adopted by the General Assembly on 2 June 2006 and the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session on HIV/AIDS in 2001, which all affirm that the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is essential to reduce vulnerability to HIV and the impact of AIDS, as is the involvement of people living with HIV, Recalling also Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2005/23, 2004/26 and 2003/29, and Council decision 2/107, and their acknowledgement that prevention and comprehensive care and support, including treatment and access to medication without discrimination, for those infected and affected by pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are inseparable elements of an effective response and must be integrated into a comprehensive approach to respond to such pandemics, Recalling further Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2005/24, 2004/27, 2003/28 and 2002/31, in which the Commission reaffirms the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and also recalling Council resolution 6/29 of 14 December 2007, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Taking note with interest of the reports by the United Nations special procedures that have devoted specific attention, in the context of their mandates, to the critical intersection between the protection of human rights and an effective response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Noting with grave concern that, according to estimates by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, at the end of 2007 the number of people living with HIV was 33 million, including 2.7 million people newly infected with HIV in 2007, and that a disproportionate number of them are presently in sub-Saharan Africa, and also deploring the 25 million lives lost to HIV/AIDS since the epidemic was identified, Recalling the urgent need to scale up significantly towards the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010, affirmed by Governments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, and emphasizing the concern with the increasing instances of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, and reiterating that such discrimination affects the enjoyment of human rights and can lead to particular targeting of people living with HIV/AIDS and members of key populations affected by the epidemic, as well as increased vulnerability to HIV, and also recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen programmes or measures to eradicate multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, in particular by adopting or improving penal or civil legislation to address these phenomena, Expressing appreciation for the important role played by the engagement of civil society in the response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, Welcoming the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, adopted by the World Health Assembly on 24 May 2008, Welcoming also progress in expanding access to HIV treatment, particularly the 35 per cent increase in the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy from 2007 to 2008, noting, however, that while nearly 3 million people in low- and middle-income countries were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral medicines as of the end of 2007, an estimated 9.7 million in need lacked access to such life-saving medicines, an estimated | million end-stage HIV/AIDS patients had no access to treatment for moderate to severe pain, and many people in need failed to receive treatment for tuberculosis and other HIV-related opportunistic infections, Noting with particular concern that, also according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization, women and girls are disproportionately affected by the epidemic in that they comprise an increasing proportion of the people infected, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where women account for 57 per cent of those infected, and young women aged from 15 to 24 years are three times more likely to be infected than young men of the same age, Welcoming resolution 53/2 of 13 March 2009 of the Commission on the Status of Women and the recognition of the disproportionate impact of HIV and AIDS on women and girls and the need to increase significantly and coordinate political and financial commitment to address gender equality and equity in national HIV and AIDS responses, and recognizing the need to link the AIDS response more closely with the overall response to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to health, and underlining in this regard the interrelated nature of health- and gender-related Millennium Development Goals, Emphasizing, in view of the increasing challenges presented by HIV, including apparent trends to criminalize beyond the crime of intentional HIV transmission, and the ongoing application of HIV-specific restrictions on the entry, stay residence of HIV-positive people, the need for intensified efforts to ensure universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all in order to reduce vulnerability to HIV, prevent HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and stigma and reduce the impact of AIDS, Recognizing the need for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to significantly expand and strengthen its work with national Governments and to work with all groups of civil society to address the gap in access to services for injecting drug users in all settings, including prisons, to develop comprehensive models of appropriate service delivery for injecting drug users, to tackle the issues of stigmatization and discrimination, and to support increased capacity and resources for the provision of a comprehensive package of services for injecting drug users, including harm-reduction programmes in relation to HIV, as elaborated by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in the Technical Guide for countries to set targets for universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care for injecting drug users, in accordance with relevant national circumstances, Recalling the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and human rights as referred to by the Secretary-General in his report on the Second International Consultation on HIV/AIDS and human rights (E/CN.4/1997/37, para. 12), including the summary of the revised Guideline 6: Access to prevention, treatment, care and support (2002), which provide guidance to ensuring the respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights in the context of HIV, Welcoming the attention given to HIV-related human rights by all the human rights treaty bodies and taking note of general comment No. 3 on HIV/AIDS and the rights of the child, adopted by the Committee on the Rights of the Child at its thirty-second session, Welcoming also the positive steps taken to implement previous resolutions, including the enactment of legislation in some countries to promote human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS and to prohibit discrimination against all persons infected or presumed to be infected, living with and affected by HIV/AIDS, and members of all populations vulnerable to and affected by the epidemic, but noting with concern that one third of countries still do not have laws protecting people living with HIV/AIDS from discrimination, Welcoming further the significant role played by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and its co-sponsor agencies in cooperation with relevant bodies of the United Nations system, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, national and international non-governmental organizations, in particular organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS, in promoting and protecting human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, including fighting discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS and in the full range of prevention, treatment, care and support activities, Recalling that HIV-related stigma and discrimination are major obstacles to an effective HIV response and that discrimination on the basis of HIV or AIDS status, actual or presumed, is prohibited by existing international human rights standards and that the term “or other status” in non-discrimination provisions in international human rights texts should be interpreted as covering health status, including HIV/AIDS, Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on the protection of human rights in the context of HIV and AIDS (A/HRC/10/47), in which the Secretary-General provides an overview of action taken by a number of Governments, specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations on the implementation of the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, as referred to by the Secretary-General in his report on the Second International Consultation on HIV/AIDS and human rights (E/CN.4/1997/37,

specialized agencies, and international and non-governmental organizations to continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the respect, protection and fulfilment of human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS, as referred to in the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, as referred to in paragraph 12 of document E/CN.4/1997/37, as an essential part of efforts to achieve the goal of universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support; 2. Also calls upon all States to implement in full the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session on HIV/AIDS, in 2001, and the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS, adopted by the Assembly 2006 High-level Meeting on AIDS; 3. Invites States, United Nations organs, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries, in particular least developed countries and those in Africa, in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV/AIDS on the human rights of their populations; 4. Encourages all countries to eliminate HIV-specific restrictions on entry, stay and residence and ensure that people living with HIV are no longer excluded, detained or deported on the basis of their HIV status; 5. Recalls the commitment, as expressed by the General Assembly in its Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS on 2 June 2006, to intensifying efforts to ensure that a wide range of prevention programmes that take into account local circumstances, ethics and cultural values is available in all countries, particularly the most affected countries, including information, education and communication, in languages most understood by communities and respectful of cultures, aimed at reducing risk-taking behaviours and encouraging responsible sexual behaviour, including abstinence and fidelity, expanded access to essential commodities, including male and female condoms and sterile injecting equipment, harm-reduction efforts related to drug use, expanded access to voluntary and confidential counselling and testing, safe blood supplies, and early and effective treatment of sexually transmitted infections; 6. Urges all States to eliminate gender inequalities, gender-based abuse and violence, increase the capacity of women and girls, including those in prison or detention, to protect themselves from the risk of HIV transmission, principally through the provision of health care, and services, including sexual and reproductive health, and the provision of full access to comprehensive information and education, ensure that women can exercise their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality in order to increase their ability to protect themselves from HIV transmission, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, integrate the promotion and protection of reproductive rights, as understood in previous international commitments, such as the Programme of Action adopted by the International Conference on Population and Development in September 1994 and the Beijing Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the Fourth World Conference for Women in September 1995, as strong and robust components of their national strategies on HIV/AIDS; and take all necessary measures to improve legal access and protection for women and girls, and to create an enabling environment for the empowerment of women and strengthen their economic independence, and in this context, reiterate the importance of the role of men and boys in achieving gender equality; 7. Requests States to further develop and, where necessary, establish coordinated, participatory, gender-sensitive, transparent and accountable national policies and programmes for the HIV response, and to translate those national policies on the district level, in local action, in prisons or detentions, involving, in close cooperation with civil society and in all phases of development and implementation, non-governmental, faith- and community-based organizations, women’s organizations, advocacy groups and representatives of people living with HIV and other key populations affected by the epidemic; 8. Calls upon States to address as a priority the vulnerabilities faced by children affected by and living with HIV, including those who find themselves trapped in armed conflicts; providing support and rehabilitation to these children and their families, women and older persons, particularly in their role as caregivers, promoting child-oriented HIV/AIDS policies and programmes, including the issue of pediatric HIV services and drugs, and increased protection for children orphaned and affected by HIV/AIDS, and intensifying efforts to develop new treatments for children, and building, where needed, and supporting the social security systems that protect them; 9. Recalls the obligations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities of 2006 to provide persons with disabilities with the same range, quality and standard of free or affordable health care and programmes as provided to other people; 10. Reaffirms that the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights of the World Trade Organization does not and should not prevent members from taking measures now and in the future to protect public health and, while reiterating its commitment to that Agreement, reaffirms that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of the right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all including the production of generic antiretroviral drugs and other essential drugs for AIDS-related infections; 11.

(n) Take measures to ensure the exercise of the right to expression of views for children belonging to minorities and/or vulnerable groups, including migrant children, and indigenous children within their cultural values or ethnic identities; (o) Adopt measures, including providing or promoting the use of accessible means, modes and formats of communication, to facilitate the expression of views by children with disabilities; (p) Ensure that, while taking the necessary measures to prevent and punish the wrongful removal of children who are subjected to enforced disappearance, children whose father, mother or legal guardian is subjected to enforced disappearance and children born during the captivity of a mother subjected to enforced disappearance, and while cooperating and assisting in the search for the identification of children who have been victims of such practices and returning them to their families of origin, in accordance with legal procedures and applicable international agreements, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration and that a child who is capable of forming his or her own views shall have the right to express those views freely, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child;

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 24.

In particular, governmental experts shall bear in mind article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, which states that States parties shall carry out their obligations under the Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. 3. Furthermore, governmental experts shall carry out the reviews in full recognition of the purpose of the review process as specified in paragraph 11 of the terms of reference. 4.

It is also expected that governmental experts are not to be influenced in their assessment of the implementation of the Convention. While information generated through competent international organizations whose mandates cover anti- corruption issues and international and regional mechanisms for combating and preventing corruption is to be taken into account, governmental experts shall make their own analysis of the facts provided by the State party under review in order to present findings that are in line with all the specific requirements of the Convention provisions under review. 7. Throughout the review process, governmental experts are encouraged to contact the secretariat for any assistance required. II. Specific guidance Preparatory stage 8.

During this period, various means of dialogue shall be employed and facilitated by the secretariat, including, inter alia, e-mail communications, telephone conferences or videoconferences, and meetings to be conducted upon request by the State party under review. 10. While governmental experts shall establish open lines of communication with the other members of the review team and governmental experts of the State party under review, experts shall keep the secretariat abreast of all these communications. 11. Within one month of the establishment of the review teams or of the receipt of the self-assessment checklist, governmental experts shall actively participate in a telephone conference or videoconference, to be organized by the secretariat, for the purpose of an initial introduction of the reviewing States parties, the State party under review and the staff of the secretariat assigned to the particular country review team and for general orientation, including a review of the schedule and requirements established for the review. 12.

The analysis is to be concise and factual and is to include solid reasoning for the conclusions drawn and observations made for each article of the Convention assessed. 19. Depending on the scope of the review cycle, governmental experts shall include findings with respect to the domestication in national law of each article of the Convention, as well as its implementation in practice. 20. Governmental experts shall further identify successful measures and good practices, as well as challenges, implementation gaps and areas where technical assistance may be required. 21. At the request of the State party under review and as required, governmental experts may also be asked to provide the State party under review with explanations on how to bridge the gaps identified so as to allow the country to fully and effectively implement the relevant articles of the Convention. 22.

In particular, governmental experts shall keep in mind the following points throughout the country visit. 29. When seeking additional information and asking for clarification, governmental experts shall bear in mind the non-adversarial, non-intrusive and non- punitive character of the review and the overall goal of assisting the State party under review to reach full implantation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 30. Governmental experts are expected to actively and constructively participate in all meetings, including at internal debriefings at the end of each working day, or at the end of the country visit or joint meeting in Vienna. 31. Governmental experts are expected to be respectful and courteous in meetings, respecting time frames set in the programme and allowing time for all members to participate. At the same time, governmental experts are expected to be flexible, as the programme may change during the visit. 32. Questions should seek to complement information already provided by the State party under review and relate only to the review process. Governmental experts shall therefore remain neutral and not voice personal opinions during the meetings. 33. Governmental experts are expected to take notes during all meetings, which can be referred to when producing the final report. They shall share their opinions and preliminary findings during debriefings, as well as in writing within two weeks after the country visit. 34.

Throughout the review process, governmental experts and the secretariat shall be guided by the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the terms of reference of the Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 2. In particular, governmental experts shall bear in mind article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, which states that States parties shall carry out their obligations under the Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. 3. Furthermore, governmental experts shall carry out the reviews in full recognition of the purpose of the review process as specified in paragraph 11 of the terms of reference. 4. During all interactions within the review process, governmental experts shall respect the collective approach. Governmental experts are expected to act with courtesy and diplomacy, and shall remain objective and impartial. Governmental experts need to be flexible in their approach and ready to adapt to changes in schedules. 5. Governmental experts and the secretariat shall maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of, or used in, the country review process, as well as the outcome documents, as stipulated in the terms of reference. If there are serious grounds for believing that a governmental expert or a member of the secretariat has violated the obligation of confidentiality, the secretariat shall inform the Implementation Review Group. 6. It is also expected that governmental experts are not to be influenced in their assessment of the implementation of the Convention. While information generated through competent international organizations whose mandates cover anti- corruption issues and international and regional mechanisms for combating and preventing corruption is to be taken into account, governmental experts shall make their own analysis of the facts provided by the State party under review in order to present findings that are in line with all the specific requirements of the Convention provisions under review. 7. Throughout the review process, governmental experts are encouraged to contact the secretariat for any assistance required. II. Specific guidance Preparatory stage 8. The governmental experts shall prepare themselves by: 12 CAC/COSP/2009/L.9 (a) Studying thoroughly the Convention; (b) Reading the Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption,‘ particularly those parts pertaining to the articles that are the subject of the relevant review cycle; (c) Familiarizing themselves with the substantive background information contained in annex A to the present guidelines; (d) Reviewing the responses provided by the State party under review in its self-assessment checklist and supplementary documentation; (e) Informing the secretariat if additional information and material are required; (f) Highlighting issues requiring further clarification; (g) Familiarizing themselves with the issues addressed by the State party under review, and formulating questions and comments. Constructive dialogue 9. Constructive dialogue is key to the efficiency and effectiveness of the review process.

During this period, various means of dialogue shall be employed and facilitated by the secretariat, including, inter alia, e-mail communications, telephone conferences or videoconferences, and meetings to be conducted upon request by the State party under review. 10. While governmental experts shall establish open lines of communication with the other members of the review team and governmental experts of the State party under review, experts shall keep the secretariat abreast of all these communications. 11. Within one month of the establishment of the review teams or of the receipt of the self-assessment checklist, governmental experts shall actively participate in a telephone conference or videoconference, to be organized by the secretariat, for the purpose of an initial introduction of the reviewing States parties, the State party under review and the staff of the secretariat assigned to the particular country review team and for general orientation, including a review of the schedule and requirements established for the review. 12.

The analysis is to be concise and factual and is to include solid reasoning for the conclusions drawn and observations made for each article of the Convention assessed. 19. Depending on the scope of the review cycle, governmental experts shall include findings with respect to the domestication in national law of each article of the Convention, as well as its implementation in practice. 20. Governmental experts shall further identify successful measures and good practices, as well as challenges, implementation gaps and areas where technical assistance may be required. 21. At the request of the State party under review and as required, governmental experts may also be asked to provide the State party under review with explanations on how to bridge the gaps identified so as to allow the country to fully and effectively implement the relevant articles of the Convention. 22. As required, the secretariat will organize a telephone conference or videoconference bringing together the governmental experts of the reviewing States parties and the State party under review. During the conference call, governmental experts from the reviewing States parties shall introduce their parts of the report and explain the findings and observations. 23. Once governmental experts’ contributions from the reviewing States parties have been received, the secretariat will prepare a first of the country review report, based on the blueprint format.

While the Secretariat will facilitate all practical arrangements, governmental experts shall take all necessary measures from their side to participate in the country visit. 28. During the country visit or joint meeting in Vienna, governmental experts shall uphold the principles and standards outlined in the general guidance above. In particular, governmental experts shall keep in mind the following points throughout the country visit. 29. When seeking additional information and asking for clarification, governmental experts shall bear in mind the non-adversarial, non-intrusive and non- punitive character of the review and the overall goal of assisting the State party under review to reach full implantation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 30. Governmental experts are expected to actively and constructively participate in all meetings, including at internal debriefings at the end of each working day, or at the end of the country visit or joint meeting in Vienna. 31. Governmental experts are expected to be respectful and courteous in meetings, respecting time frames set in the programme and allowing time for all members to participate. At the same time, governmental experts are expected to be flexible, as the programme may change during the visit. 32. Questions should seek to complement information already provided by the State party under review and relate only to the review process. Governmental experts shall therefore remain neutral and not voice personal opinions during the meetings. 33. Governmental experts are expected to take notes during all meetings, which can be referred to when producing the final report. They shall share their opinions and preliminary findings during debriefings, as well as in writing within two weeks after the country visit. 34. Once comments from governmental experts of the reviewing States parties have been received, the secretariat will prepare an amended country review report, taking into account the additional information received during the meetings. Governmental experts shall comment on this report within two weeks after receiving it. 35. The secretariat will then follow the same procedure as outlined in paragraphs 22 to 26 above.] 15 CAC/COSP/2009/L.9 Annex A Substantive background information relevant to the articles subject to the review cycle Relevant parts of the Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and other relevant United Nations tools.
