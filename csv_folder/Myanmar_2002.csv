Stresses that structural adjustment policies have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 2. Deeply aware that the structural adjustment programmes give inadequate attention to the provision of social services and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 3. Expresses its concern at the persistence of the external debt problem, that the vicious cycle of debt and underdevelopment has become further entrenched, that debt service has grown at a much greater rate than the debt itself and that the burden of payments has become heavier in many developing countries, including those with low and middle incomes, despite repeated rescheduling, and that the current debt and poverty reduction and growth initiatives lack sufficient funding and have several conditions attached; 4. Also expresses its concern at the external debt overhang that affects most least developed countries and remains a main obstacle to their development; 5. Recalls the pledge, contained in the political declaration contained in the annex to resolution S-24/2 of 1 July 2000 adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 6. Welcomes the conclusion of the statement on poverty adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001 that some of the structural obstacles confronting developing States’ anti-poverty strategies lie beyond their control in the contemporary international order and that it is imperative that measures be taken urgently to remove these global structural obstacles, such as unsustainable foreign debt, the widening gap between rich and poor, and the absence of an equitable multilateral trade, investment and financial system; otherwise, the national anti-poverty strategies of some States have limited chance of success; 7. Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based, inter alia, on open, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, predictable, transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems, which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 8. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and a consistent way, with the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the specific characteristics, conditions and needs of the debtor countries; 9. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 10. Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt, in particular in the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms, to be extended, expedited, implemented completely and made more flexible, and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives, which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis; 11. Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 12. Requests the independent expert to present an analytical report to the Commission, on an annual basis, on the implementation of the present resolution, paying particular attention to: (a) The effects of the foreign debt and the policies adopted to face them on the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights in developing countries; (b) Measures taken by Governments, the private sector and international financial institutions to alleviate such effects in developing countries, especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries; E/CN.4/2002/L.45 page S5 (c) New developments, actions and initiatives being taken by international financial institutions, other United Nations bodies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with respect to structural adjustment policies and human rights; 13.

Requests the Secretary-General to provide the independent expert with all necessary assistance, in particular the staff and resources required to perform his functions; 15. Urges Governments, international organizations, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and the private sector to cooperate fully with the independent expert in the discharge of his mandate; 16. Calls upon Governments, international organizations and international financial institutions, as well as non-governmental organizations and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and action for the implementation of the commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits organized since the beginning of the 1990s on developments related to the question of external debt; 17. Also calls upon Governments, international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries, giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters; 18. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care, research and treatment of 13. 14. 18. the population in the affected countries; 19. Recognizes that there is a need for more transparency, participation by all States and consideration of the relevant resolutions of the Commission in the deliberations and activities of international and regional financial institutions; 20. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem, there is a need for a political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests 20. and responsibilities; 21. Requests the Economic and Social Council to authorize the Working Group on Structural Adjustment to meet for two weeks well in advance of, and at least four weeks prior to, the fifty-ninth session of the Commission with the mandate to: (a) continue working on the elaboration of basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment programmes and economic, social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and international financial institutions, and () report to the Commission at its fifty-ninth session; 22. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay particular attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of the least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from the foreign debt; 23. Requests the High Commissioner to take urgent action to strengthen the responsiveness of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the area of economic, social and cultural rights; 24.

Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State; 2. Reaffirms that, in addition to States’ separate responsibilities to their individual societies, they have a collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level; 3. Also reaffirms the commitment to create an environment at both the national and international levels that is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty through, inter alia, good governance within each country and at the international level, transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system; 4.

Welcomes the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights (E/CN.4/2002/54), which focuses on the liberalization of agricultural trade and its impact on the realization of the right to development, including the right to food, and takes note of the conclusions and recommendations contained therein; 6. Underlines that, in the absence of a framework based on the fundamental principles which underpin the corpus of human rights, such as equality, participation, accountability, non-discrimination, respect for diversity and international cooperation and solidarity, globalization will continue on its inherently asymmetrical course; 7. Requests, therefore, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, taking fully into account the present resolution and in cooperation with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the World Trade Organization and other relevant international financial and economic institutions, to study and clarify the fundamental principle of non-discrimination and its application at the global level with a view to recommending measures for its integration and effective implementation in the debate on and process of globalization, and to submit a comprehensive analytical study on that subject to the Commission at its fifty-ninth session; 8.

Underlines once again, the need for the treaty bodies, special rapporteurs/ representatives, independent experts and working groups of the Commission, within their mandates and where appropriate, to take into consideration the content of the present resolution and the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on globalization and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights; 10. Requests the High Commissioner for Human Rights to integrate the theme of globalization and its impact on the enjoyment of human rights in the programmes of her Office concerning regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights and, in this context, convene intersessional workshops during the year to gather relevant data and opinions with a view to evaluating the varied impact of globalization on the enjoyment of human rights in various regions/parts of the world, and to report to the Commission at its next session; 11.
