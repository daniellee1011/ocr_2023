undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments, and the illicit traffic in and proliferation of armaments, especially small arms and light weapons, Recognizing also the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts, Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security, Recognizing, therefore, that urgent action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, Recognizing also the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for urgent international action to 03-32135 (E) 110403 *0332135* prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in

diamonds, Recalling further its resolutions 55/56 of 1 December 2000 and 56/263 of 13 March 2002 in which it called for the development of proposals for a simple and workable international certification scheme for rough diamonds based primarily on national certification schemes and on internationally agreed minimum standards, under the Kimberley Process, Believing that the introduction of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme should substantially reduce the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict and should help to protect the legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds, Recalling the objective of ensuring that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme should be simple, effective and pragmatic and that it should not impede the present legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and should not hinder the development of the diamond industry, Acknowledging the important initiatives already taken to address the problem of conflict diamonds, in particular by the Governments of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea and Sierra Leone and by other key producing, exporting and importing countries, and encouraging those Governments to continue the initiatives, Acknowledging also the continued efforts of regional organizations and other groups of countries to curb conflict diamonds, Welcoming the important contribution made by the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council, as well as civil society, to assist international efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds, Welcoming also the voluntary self-regulation initiatives for the diamond industry announced by the World Diamond Council, and recognizing that a system of such voluntary self-regulation will contribute, as described in the Interlaken Declaration of 5 Navember 2002 on the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds,* to ensuring the effectiveness of national systems of internal controls for rough diamonds, A/57/L.76/Rev.1 Recognizing that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme will be credible only if all participants have established internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices, as well as differences in institutional controls thereof, may require different approaches to meet minimum standards, Welcoming the important contribution of the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African diamond producing countries, Noting

industry and civil society, Recognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and the principles of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to, Welcoming the Interlaken

E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 Annex Recommendations of the Meeting of Experts on the Application of United Nations Standards and Norms in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Recommendations to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 1. The application and formulation of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should continue to be accorded high priority by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. The standing agenda item on those standards and norms should be maintained and appropriate time and resources should be devoted to it. 2. Possible future United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should focus on emerging practices in crime prevention or criminal justice, in order to facilitate the development of detailed practical guidelines for use by interested States in carrying out specific tasks. 3. The Commission should establish a mechanism, such as a group of experts and/or a special rapporteur, to supplement existing procedures for undertaking periodic reviews of the application of selected standards and norms in order to ensure their promotion, as well as to make appropriate recommendations to the Commission. 4. The focus in subsequent review cycles should be on identifying difficulties that have been encountered in the application of United Nations standards and norms, in crime prevention and criminal justice, ways in which technical assistance can be used to overcome those difficulties and desirable practices in crime prevention and control. 5. The resulting data and other information should be shared in order to enhance the level and impact of technical cooperation in the world, the overall objective being to promote criminal justice reform in line with applicable United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 6. The entire review process should be guided by the need to relate it to the main programme priorities of the United Nations, as noted in the United Nations Millennium Declaration (General Assembly resolution 55/2) and the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty- first Century (Assembly resolution 55/59, annex), including strengthening the rule of law, good governance, sustainable development and the alleviation of poverty. 7. In line with the programme priorities of the United Nations, the Commission, at each of its sessions, should seek to focus on the application of a cluster of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. The Commission may wish to consider the possibility of reviewing a presentation of a particular cluster of standards and norms and their application in specific countries. Such a presentation could be prepared in cooperation with the institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network. 8. In redesigning the information-gathering mechanisms and within the limits of current programme budget resources, the Commission should examine and propose focusing the future review process on selected clusters of instruments with the most widespread potential and relevance for application in criminal justice reforms in the E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 world, in the following order of priority, bearing in mind gender as a cross-cutting issue, and grouped into clusters as follows: (a) Juvenile justice and prison reform, including alternatives to imprisonment and restorative justice; (b) The conduct of law enforcement and criminal justice practitioners, including the integrity of the judiciary; (c) Public security and crime prevention; (d) The treatment of victims and witnesses; (e) Legal, institutional and practical arrangements for international cooperation (model treaties). 9. The Commission should request donor States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental institutions to support criminal justice reforms, in accordance with the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, in countries requesting assistance. The Commission could rely on a roster of national and regional experts who could, upon request, provide technical assistance and advice on the use and application of selected standards and norms. 10. The Commission should encourage donor countries to make financial contributions to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund. Contributions should be directed towards technical cooperation projects for implementing and promoting United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, as well as organizing meetings of experts to identify priority areas for the development of future standards and norms. Recommendations to Member States and other entities 11. Each of the Member States should be encouraged to identify at least one contact person who could serve as a knowledgeable source for the analysis of the State’s response concerning the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 12. Member States should establish mechanisms and provide resources at the national level for promoting and monitoring the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 13. Focused efforts should be made to obtain the commitment of policy makers and criminal justice managers to the implementation of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 14. Member States should publish and disseminate, in their local languages, the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 15. The United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should be easily accessible and explained in understandable language. 16. Member States, financial institutions and development agencies should support projects for the implementation of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 17. Member States, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and interregional, regional and national training and educational institutions should E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 vigorously promote programmes and projects that advance the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 18. National institutions and non-governmental organizations should integrate United Nations standards and norms fully in their relevant training programmes. Recommendations to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 19. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should emphasize in its organizational structure and operations the essential role of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 20. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should assist Member States, upon request, in the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice and in the development of projects. 21. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should seek to ensure that the relevant entities within the Secretariat and in the field are fully aware of the importance of the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice for building and maintaining the rule of law. 22. Well-focused efforts should be undertaken to encourage officials in peacekeeping and peace-building operations and their counterparts to apply United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. 23. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should identify opportunities for sharing data and other information on United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice with Governments and with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. 24. The information provided by Member States on the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should be distributed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime via the World Wide Web. 25. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should encourage financial institutions, development agencies and non-governmental organizations to expand their technical assistance programmes for improving access to justice and the rule of law. 26. The information-gathering mechanisms used by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should be reviewed in order to bring them in line with the overall programme priorities of the United Nations. The goal should be to redesign the mechanisms in a more comprehensive, consistent and operational manner, so that the collected data and other information are more relevant to those priorities. The goal should also be to enhance cooperation among respondents, both in the collection of data and in the execution of technical cooperation projects. 27. New information-gathering mechanisms should be focused on identifying difficulties encountered in application and desirable practices. The mechanisms should be based on the present United Nations priorities unless the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, to be held in 2005, identifies new priorities. E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 28. Bearing in mind the priorities, the new information-gathering mechanisms should be conceptualized and existing mechanisms reviewed along the following parameters: (a) Standards and norms related primarily to persons in custody, non- custodial sanctions and juvenile and restorative justice; (b) Standards and norms related primarily to good governance, the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of criminal justice personnel; (c) Standards and norms related primarily to crime prevention and victim issues; (d) Standards and norms related primarily to legal, institutional and practical arrangements for international cooperation. 29. Reviews of United Nations standards and norms related primarily to capital punishment should be conducted pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995/57 of 28 July 1995, in which the Council recommended that the quinquennial reports of the Secretary-General should continue to cover the implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. 30. In gathering information on the above-mentioned priorities, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should also focus its efforts on practical measures that make it possible to determine their operational usefulness in restoring or maintaining law and order, with particular reference to developing countries, countries with economies in transition and post-conflict situations. 31. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should continue to explore the possibility of additional approaches and techniques in information-gathering in order to develop even more concise, simplified and cross-sectoral methods. 32. The survey instruments should be designed to be short, easy to complete and comprehensible. 33. The Secretary-General is requested to involve the regional institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network in the review and design of the information-gathering instruments and the analysis of information collected. 34. Procedures should be developed according to which the Secretary-General, in reporting on the application of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, would be able to utilize not only other relevant information available within the United Nations, but also the expertise of specialized agencies, relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and academic institutions. Recommendations on training 35. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should continue to develop and produce manuals, modules and tools to be used in providing training on United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, to carry out a limited number of such training courses and workshops and to coordinate such training with other United Nations entities. E/CN.15/2003/L.17/Rev.1 36. A training unit should be created within the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and resources should be allocated for training and coordination functions. 37. To the maximum extent possible, the institutes in the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network should be utilized in the planning and conduct of such training activities. 38. In cooperation with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs of the Secretariat, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should develop basic training materials for peacekeeping and peace-building operations. Recommendations on technical cooperation 39. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime should establish rosters of national and regional experts who would be able to provide, upon request, technical assistance and advice on the application of particular types of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. Such rosters should be developed in accordance with the different clusters of such standards and norms. 40. The advisory services of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in relation to United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice should be enhanced. Projects should be evaluated in the light of the information gathered. The lessons learned should be incorporated into future planning so that the capacity to execute technical assistance projects can be improved. 41. At the request of Member States, practical projects should be developed, in particular for victims’ support services and witness protection, prison reform and alternatives to imprisonment, juvenile justice and restorative justice.",05/21/2003,2003_498321,Canada,N/A,yes
2003,Convention On The Rights Of The Child,N/A,Eighteenth session,9 (a),OTHER ISSUESISSUES RELATING TO CLEANER OR LESS-GREENHOUSE-GAS-EMITTING ENERGY,"Canada continues to believe strongly in the importance of optimizing the uptake of cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, in the role that trade in such energy can play in meeting the objectives of the Protocol and the Convention, and in the need for appropriate recognition, within the framework of the Protocol, for the global environmental benefits created by such trade. It was for these reasons that, at SBSTA 17, in New Delhi,",N/A,Canada’,"s proposal at SBSTA 17 was completely different than the earlier COP decision put forward by Canada at SBSTA 16 requesting up to 70 Mt of annual credits of CO,e for Canada’s exports of cleaner energy to the United States. In the course of the consultations that he conducted on the new Canadian proposal, SBSTA Chairman Thorgeirsson proposed conclusions that modified the Canadian proposal to more widely accommodate the interests of different Parties. The Chairman’s proposal, inviting Parties to submit views on terms of reference for, and issues to be addressed by a study on issues related to cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, was one with which Canada indicated it could agree. Unfortunately, no consensus was possible on either the new Canadian proposal or Chairman Thorgeirsson’s, and the conclusions eventually adopted stated only that consideration of the issues under this agenda sub-item was not completed. Since that time much progress has been made in Canada with respect to climate change. On November 21, 2002, the Government published the Climate Change Plan for Canada, in which it indicated how it intends to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitment. Shortly thereafter, on December 17"", Canada ratified the Protocol. In February 2003, the Government tabled a budget that allocated $Cdn 2 billion over five years for the implementation of the Climate Change Plan for Canada, which brings the Government’s total investment in measures to fight climate change since 1998 to $Cdn 3.7 billion. While Canada is clearly committed to meeting its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol and is taking decisive action to do so, the Climate Change Plan for Canada reflects the fact that the issue of recognition for cleaner energy exports continues to be a high priority for the Canadian government, as well as for Canada’s provinces and territories. During the High Level Segment of COP &, the Honorable David Anderson, Canada’s Minister of the Environment, indicated that Canada will continue to seek to promote the role of cleaner energy exports in meeting the objectives of the Convention and the Protocol, and believes that the global environmental benefits created by such exports should be taken into consideration when we negotiate second commitment period targets. As noted by Minister Anderson, the issue of cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy has a longer- term aspect, for the second and subsequent commitment periods, and for the advancement of the objectives of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, which Canada believes should be of interest to all Parties. Canada sees this issue as important for the future of the Protocol and for all Parties, as we collectively make the transition to a lower greenhouse gas-emitting global economy. Canada therefore request that the proposal that Canada put forward at SBSTA 17 and contained in the appendix to this document, be noted in the SBSTA 18 conclusions. Appendix Draft Decision -/CP. 8 The role of trade in cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy toward meeting the objectives of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol The Conference of the Parties, Mindful of the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2, Recalling the report on the second part of the sixth session of the Conference of the Parties (document FCCC/CP/2001/2, section II, sub-section A), in which it “recognized that cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, emphasizing renewables, hydro, geothermal, and natural gas, could promote global environmental benefits to meet the objectives of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol and optimize the uptake of cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy”, Recalling the report of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice on its sixteenth session (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/6) in which the SBSTA took note of proposed approaches to issues related to cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.3 and of submissions by Canada and by Venezuela on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, contained in documents FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.3/Add.1 and FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.3/Add.2, respectively; and, agreed to continue consideration of these issues at its seventeenth session, Recognizing the potential of cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy to promote global environmental benefits to meet the objectives of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, 1.

Decides that with respect to any adjustments applied retroactively in accordance with paragraph 11 of the technical guidance, only the adjustment applied for the inventory year under review shall be relevant for the eligibility requirement laid out in paragraph 3 (e) of decision -/CMP.1 (Guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 22/CP.7. TECHNICAL GUIDANCE ON METHODOLOGIES FOR ADJUSTMENTS UNDER ARTICLE 5, PARAGRAPH 2, OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL I. OBJECTIVE 1. The objective of this technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol' is: (a) To provide for adjusted estimates that fully meet the requirements of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7;’ (b) To ensure that adjustments are applied consistently,” comparably and transparently, taking into account the time frames provided in the guidelines for review under Article 8, and that, as far as possible, similar methods are used for similar problems across all inventories subject to adjustments under Article 8. II. GENERAL APPROACH 2. This technical guidance establishes general and specific procedures and methods for use by expert review teams to calculate adjustments.* These procedures and methods are supplemented by inventory review resources listed in annex I to this technical guidance, which will also facilitate consistency in calculation of adjustments by expert review teams. A. Procedures 3. The calculation and application of adjustments shall follow paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7. 4. Adjustments shall be applied, taking into account section II.B below, only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC’ Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC Guidelines) as elaborated by the [IPCC report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance) and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). 5. Expert review teams shall, under their collective responsibility, calculate, document and recommend adjustments in accordance with the provisions for the review of annual inventories under ' All articles referred to in this technical guidance are those of the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol are hereinafter referred to as adjustments. Document FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.3, pages 12—13. > In this context, consistency means that the application of adjustments should be consistent across Parties and by all expert review teams. * This technical guidance does not cover the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, guidance for which will be completed, in accordance with decision 21/CP.7, after completion of the IPCC good practice guidance on LULUCF. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Article 8 and this technical guidance. A compilation of the paragraphs relevant to the timing and reporting of adjustments from these guidelines is included in annex II to this technical guidance. 6. The expert review team should collectively decide on the methodological approach for calculation of any adjustment, including relevant components of the adjustment method (such as data sources, drivers® and clusters’ used). 7. Expert review teams should apply the appropriate adjustment method, selected from table 1, in a simple manner, given the limited time available for the calculation of adjustments according to the provisions for the review of annual inventories in the guidelines for review under Article 8 (see paragraph 3 of annex II). 8. Expert review teams should apply this technical guidance in a consistent and comparable manner and, as far as possible, use similar methods for similar problems across all inventories reviewed under Article 8, taking into account the provisions for obtaining conservative estimates, as described in paragraph 47 below. 9. To enhance consistency in the application of adjustments for any given Party, the same adjustment method should be used, whenever possible, in cases where the same inventory problem was adjusted in an earlier year (e.g. for the base year or for an earlier year of the commitment period). This provision applies to both the basic adjustment method,® and the main components used in the calculation of the adjustment, as appropriate, such as the source of international data, drivers, clusters and any other inventory parameter used. 10. Adjustments should be applied only for individual inventory years, specifically, the base year’ or the latest year of the commitment period under review, and not for an entire time series or group of years, except for cases described in paragraph 11 below. 11. Adjustments should not be retroactively applied for any year preceding the inventory year subject to review, except in cases where recalculated estimates for previous commitment period years were submitted by the Party together with the inventory information of the inventory year subject to review. Where the Party submits recalculated estimates for commitment period years prior to the inventory year subject to review, adjustments may be applied retrospectively for those estimates that have not yet been reviewed, if the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. 12. The selection of data and other components required for an adjustment method should take into account the time series for any such component. 13. Even if some aspects of a particular case are not fully covered by this technical guidance, the experts calculating the adjustment shall adhere to paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) and, as closely as possible, to this technical guidance. ® For the purpose of this technical guidance, driver refers to indicative data other than activity data or other inventory parameters used in the calculation of emission estimates, that are correlated with emissions, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, associated production data, wells drilled, GDP per capita. The criteria for selecting drivers for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 36. For the purpose of this technical guidance, cluster refers to inventory-related data from a group of countries. The criteria for selecting clusters for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 35. ¥ For the purpose of this technical guidance, basic adjustment methods are those methods that provide an emission estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section III.D below. ’ Adjustments to the base year, if any, will only be applied during the initial review under Article 8 for the purpose of establishing the Party's assigned amount. B. Applicability of adjustments 14. In considering the need for an adjustment, expert review teams should adhere to standard inventory review approaches, which also include assessment of the time series for a given estimate. 15. If the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of emissions in the base year, or an overestimation of emissions in a year of the commitment period, the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 49 below should not be applied, if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate with a value for the base year that is higher than the original estimate submitted by the Party or a value for a year of the commitment period that is lower than the original estimate. 16. An adjustment procedure should be initiated if the information provided by the Party is not sufficiently transparent, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 4 above. 17. If the expert review team identifies a deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance that is caused by the allocation of estimates to a wrong source category, adjustments should be applied only if reallocation to the correct source category affects total emissions from sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol.' III. METHODS AND CONSERVATIVENESS 18. In general, expert review teams shall calculate each adjustment at the level at which the problem is identified, e.g. the IPCC source category level or for the specific component in question. If the problem is limited to only one IPCC source category, only the estimate for that source should be adjusted. Similarly, if only one component of a given estimate is problematic (such as inconsistent, incorrect or misapplied emission factors or other inventory parameters, or activity data), the review team should replace only that component in calculating the adjusted estimate. 19. If the necessary input data or parameters are not available at the IPCC source category level at which the problem is identified, or the problem involves more than one component of an emission estimation method used by the Party, or the complexity of the methodology used does not allow replacing only the problematic component in question, more aggregate data should be used as the basis for the adjustment. However, expert review teams should make every effort to make the adjustment at the levels at which the problems were identified, in order to avoid making data that do not qualify for an adjustment subject to the adjustment. A. Choice of methods 20. If an emission estimate needs to be adjusted,'' the expert review team should choose one of the basic adjustment methods in this technical guidance for the calculation of an estimate for purposes of adjustment. 21. In choosing the basic adjustment method and the input data that are appropriate for a specific adjustment case, expert review teams should, in general, follow the methods listed in priority order in table 1, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated in the sector-specific elements included in chapter IV. 1% If the reallocation will not have such effect, reallocation is recommended to the Party as part of the review of annual inventories under Article 8. """""" For example, if an emission estimate is missing, if the emission estimation method used by the Party was not in conformity with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, or if there is a problem with more than one component (emission factor, activity data or other parameter) of the emission estimation method used by the Party. If the requirements for the highest priority adjustment method according to the table are not available, the next preferred adjustment method should be used. 22. If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two years’ estimates are missing, a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method. 23. If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency, and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the cause of the potential deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance (such as inappropriate activity data, emission factors or methods), expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1. 24. In the exceptional case where none of the basic adjustment methods listed in table 1 is suitable for a given adjustment case, expert review teams may use other adjustment methods. If adjustment methods other than those included in this technical guidance are applied, expert review teams should report the reason for not using any of the basic adjustment methods of this technical guidance and should justify why they consider the method chosen as appropriate. Table 1.

Further details on the basic adjustment methods listed in this table are given in section III.C below. Driver for the country in question and emission rate per driver for a cluster of countries B. Choice of data and other components 25. In choosing any input data for calculating an adjustment, expert review teams should give, as appropriate, preference to the national data available in the respective Party’s inventory submission or made available by the Party before or during the review, provided that these data were not the cause for the adjustment. 26. Expert review teams should not conduct time-consuming searches for national data that have not been made available to the review team by the Party, or generate new country-specific data. 27. If national data as indicated in paragraph 25 above are not available or are not deemed suitable for the respective adjustment case, expert review teams should select data from the recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in annex 1. 28. The international data sources to be included in the inventory review resources listed in annex | should meet most of the following criteria: (a) The organizations that make the data available are recognized intergovernmental organizations (e.g. United Nations, International Energy Agency (IEA)); The data are regularly updated, maintained and disseminated; (b) The data are originally generated by the countries themselves (national statistics); (©) The data are widely applicable to Annex I Parties; (d) (e) The data are easily accessible by the secretariat and expert review teams (e.g. through Internet or CD-ROM)), in a timely manner and at reasonable cost; ) Sufficient information is available to assess the applicability of activity data, drivers or emission factors (e.g. descriptions of how the data are collected, which definitions are used, geographic coverage). 1. Choice of activity data 29. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of activity data, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the activity data are the cause of the adjustment, and if no national data are available, expert review teams should use, in order of preference: (a) Recommended international data sources as included in the inventory review resources listed in annex I; (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) methods if the international data sources do not provide data for the year in question, in which case the activity data should be obtained as follows (in order of preference): Extrapolation (interpolation) of national activity data, if these data are available as required in paragraph 25 above, and were collected in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance; (1) Extrapolation (interpolation) of data from recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in annex [; (i) Extrapolation (interpolation) using drivers or surrogate data from the inventory review resources listed in annex I. (iii) (c) Activity data based on appropriate drivers (e.g. activity data per capita) from cluster of countries following the provisions of paragraphs 31-34 below. 2. Choice of emission factors or other inventory parameters 30. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of an emission factor or other inventory parameter, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the emission factor or other inventory parameter itself is the cause of the adjustment, the expert review team should use, in order of preference: (a) IPCC default values from the IPCC good practice guidance, the IPCC Guidelines or other recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in annex |, and consistent with the [IPCC good practice guidance. If emission factors from other international data sources are used, the expert review team should, in the review report, justify and document the reason for their use; (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) of the national emission factor, implied emission factor or other inventory parameter from earlier years as reported in the common reporting format (CRF) or national inventory report if the factor in question was prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance; (c) Average implied emission factor or other inventory parameter from a cluster of countries obtained as described in paragraphs 31-34 below. 3. Choice of drivers and clusters 31. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use of a driver, the expert review team should use the recommended drivers as included in the inventory review resources listed in annex I. 32. If an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries is used, expert review teams should follow the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data as included in the inventory review resources listed in annex I. The inclusion in the inventory review resources listed in annex I of drivers and approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data should be subject to guidance by lead reviewers in accordance with the provisions of annex 1. 33. Expert review teams should report the reason for the use of drivers and clusters and demonstrate the appropriateness of the cluster and/or the correlation between the driver and the emissions. The use of drivers or approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data other than those recommended in the inventory review resources listed in annex I should be explained and justified. 34, When using an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries, assumptions made in choosing the cluster should be documented, as should how the given inventory average parameter compares with the default parameter or range provided in the IPCC good practice guidance or [IPCC Guidelines, where available. Similarly, when clustering is related to the use of a driver (application of an average driver-based emission rate) from a cluster of countries, assumptions made for the composition of the cluster and the established relationship with the driver should be documented. 35. The clusters'” to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria, taking into account expert judgement: (a) Only Annex I Parties that have undergone an individual review, and for which the relevant data were deemed accurate during the review process and for which no adjustment to any 2"" Because of the need to use reviewed data from other countries, clustering will only be possible for one year prior to the year in question. This implies that clustering would have to be combined with extrapolation techniques. inventory parameter of the gases or source categories concerned was made, should be included. Inventory data from the Party subject to adjustment should be excluded from the cluster; (b) The cluster should cover a minimum number of countries, as specified in the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data; () The grouping of countries into clusters should, to the extent possible, take into account similar national circumstances. National circumstances could relate to, inter alia, climatic conditions, economic development, operation or management practices, types of oil and gas activity, or the age of equipment or installations and their technical features, depending on the source category in question. 36. The drivers to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria: The driver shall be adequately correlated with the emissions concerned; (a) (b) The significance of the relationship between the driver used and the emissions calculated needs to be demonstrated, taking into account national circumstances. C. Details and variations on the basic adjustment methods 37. The following section provides further guidance on the application of the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A above. Because this section covers possible variations of those methods, the numbering and ordering do not match the list in table 1. 1. Default IPCC tier 1 methods 38. This basic adjustment method refers to default IPCC tier 1 methods as described in the IPCC Guidelines and as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance. If this adjustment method is used, the IPCC good practice guidance should always be consulted before the IPCC Guidelines. This adjustment method will only be applicable if activity data are available from national sources in accordance with paragraph 25 above or from international data sources as described in paragraph 27 above, or are obtained as described in paragraph 29 above. An emission factor or other inventory parameter as required by the method and obtained as described in paragraph 30 above should be used. 2. Extrapolation and interpolation methods 39. If extrapolation and/or interpolation methods are used, the expert review team should follow the guidance on trend extrapolation and interpolation provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, section 7.3.2.2. 40. Extrapolation of emission estimates is applicable if inventory estimates are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the beginning (base year) and/or the end (latest inventory year) of the time series, and reviewed and time-series-consistent values are available for most years of the time series. 41. Extrapolation of inventory parameters (e.g. activity data): in addition to applying extrapolation methods to emission estimates it may be necessary to use extrapolation at the level of activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances (see paragraphs 29 and 30 above). 42. Extrapolation of emissions using drivers or surrogate data can be applied if inventory estimates are available for some years (at a minimum for all years but two) of the time series but are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the required year (base year and/or latest inventory year). The emissions need to be strongly correlated with other well-known and more readily available indicative data (drivers). 43. Interpolation is applicable for calculating an adjustment for a given inventory year provided that reviewed values of the adjacent years are available. As adjustments will be undertaken on individual inventory years, this method would most likely be applied in exceptional cases only, but could be applicable to activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances. 3. Adjustment methods based on correlation of emissions between source categories or gases 44, Correlation of emissions between source categories or gases within an inventory could in some cases be used to estimate emissions of a specific gas or from a specific source category. For example, CH, and N,O emissions from fuel combustion activities could be calculated from CO, emissions, if available. 7. deusfmenf methods based on clusferlng of countries 45. Application of average inventory parameters from a cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances for the sector in question could be used to correct any inventory parameter (e.g. emission factor) that was found not to be in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance, or as input to the IPCC tier 1 method. The inventory review resources listed in annex I provide recommended approaches and tools for clustering inventory data. If an adjustment has to be made for a given country, expert review teams should assign the Party in question to the cluster of countries to which it would most likely belong according to its national circumstances. 46. Application of an average driver-based emission rate from a cluster of countries can be used if an emission estimate is missing entirely or was not prepared in accordance with the [IPCC good practice guidance, but data for a parameter driving the emissions from that source are available for the country in question. The estimate is derived by establishing a relationship between emissions and an appropriate driver for the cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances, and applying this relationship to the Party in question. If data for the driver are not available for the year in question, the driver should be extrapolated as described in paragraph 42 above. D. Conservative approach 47. The choice of adjustment methods and application of the inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative emission estimates, in that emission estimates for the base year are not overestimated and emission estimates for a year of the commitment period are not underestimated relative to the likely true value of the emissions of the Party concerned. 48. As a principle to achieve conservative estimates, the calculation of an adjustment for a commitment period year should not result in an emission estimate that is lower than that originally submitted by the Party, and an adjustment for an estimate of the base year should not result in an emission estimate that is higher than the originally submitted estimate. 49. To ensure conservativeness for the purpose of adjustments, a conservativeness factor should be applied to the specific component of the emission estimation method used by the Party or to the emission estimate generated by the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A of this technical guidance. For illustration purposes, this approach may be expressed as: M x CF = Adjusted estimate Where M is the component of an emission estimation method used by a Party, or the emission estimate generated by a basic adjustment method in this technical guidance, and CF is the conservativeness factor. 50. The conservativeness factor should be selected from the table of conservativeness factors provided in annex III to this technical guidance. In the case that the table does not provide a conservativeness factor for a given source category, a conservativeness factor for a source category with similar characteristics should be used. 51. For cases where only one component of an emission estimation method used by a Party is replaced, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to that component, in accordance with paragraph 18 above. In other cases, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to the emission estimate generated by the basic adjustment method, in accordance with paragraph 20 above. 52. If, exceptionally, an expert review team considers that, in its expert judgement, the estimate generated by applying the basic approach referred to in paragraph 49 above is not conservative or is overly conservative for the Party concerned, the expert review team may use an alternative approach for applying conservativeness, and, where applicable, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 18 and 24 above. The expert review team shall justify and document the technical reason for its decision, and for its choice of the alternative approach used, and include this information in the review report. IV. SECTOR-SPECIFIC ELEMENTS 53. When calculating adjustments, expert review teams should follow the provisions of chapter 111 taking into account the sector-specific elements given below, as appropriate. The provisions of this chapter apply to the calculation of the adjustments before applying the conservativeness factor described in section IIL.D above. A. Fuel combustion 54. When adjusting CO, emissions from one or several disaggregated IPCC source categories, care should be taken that total CO, emissions are in accordance with the total fuel consumption, which is generally better known than the fuel consumption in each of the disaggregated IPCC source categories. 55. In the event that total CO, emissions from fuel combustion need to be adjusted, the reference approach is the preferred option for calculating an adjustment. Reference approach estimates should preferably be taken from the Party. If this is not considered appropriate, emission estimates from the IEA can be used. "" That is, the expert review team believes that the likely true value of the emissions from a source for a year of the commitment period is higher or much lower than the adjusted estimate generated, or the true value of the emissions from a source in the base year is lower or much higher than the adjusted estimate generated, taking into account any guidance from lead reviewers on this matter. 56. If an N,O emission factor from road transport needs to be replaced, increased use of catalytic converters leading to increased emission factors should be taken into account when calculating an adjustment. B. Industrial processes 57. The expert review team should consider the possibility of double counting (for instance, the use of lime in iron and steel production) and avoid any double counting through the application of adjustments. 58. If adjusting HFC, PFC and SF estimates from the consumption of halocarbons and SFq, consideration should be given to the uncertainty of sales figures (e.g. for sales of these chemicals to the foam blowing industry) and other parameters (such as the composition of the mix in coolants) as given in the IPCC good practice guidance. C. Agriculture 59. When adjusting emissions from agricultural soils, preference should be given to tier 1.a methods as provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. 60. The expert review team should note that when adjusting emissions from manure management systems, savanna burning, or field burning of agricultural residues, the same activity data should be used for CH, as for N,O. 61. Similarly, consistent livestock data should be used for CH4 and N,O emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management, and for N,O emissions from animal manure applied to soils. D. Waste 62. Data on populations and/or urban populations, and GDP per capita, could be used in some cases to estimate the volume of solid waste, taking into account national circumstances. Urban population and protein consumption data could be used to obtain activity data to estimate emissions from domestic waste-water handling. Production data associated with the main industries in a specific country could be used as a possible driver to estimate the amount of industrial waste water, taking into account differences in technologies (e.g. emission per unit production). 63. For activity data, a cluster of countries based mainly on waste management practices could be used for estimating certain types of data, such as the waste generation rate, but not for estimating other types of data, such as the amount of waste incinerated or the amount of waste deposited, because these data largely depend on national environmental waste management policies. When adjusting emissions from waste incineration, the applicability of drivers is very limited. 64. 65. When adjusting emissions from solid waste disposal sites or waste-water treatment, the recovery of the methane needs to be considered. For solid waste disposal the expert review team should also take into account that if activity data are constant or increasing and the country used the IPCC tier 1 default method, this will have resulted in a conservative emission estimate.

Annex II PROVISIONS IN THE GUIDELINES FOR REVIEW UNDER ARTICLE 8 OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL THAT RELATE TO ADJUSTMENTS I. TIMING 1. Within the review of the inventory, the expert review team shall list all the problems identified, indicating which would need an adjustment, and send this list to the Annex I Party no later than 25 weeks from the submission due date of the annual inventory. This list should be prepared under the collective responsibility of the expert review team. 2. The Annex I Party shall comment on these questions within six weeks and, where requested by the review team, may provide revised estimates. 3. If adjustments are still needed, the expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with this technical guidance, in consultation with the Party concerned, and shall prepare a individual inventory review report which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates and related information, within eight weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed, and shall send the report to the Party concerned. 4. The Annex [ Party shall be provided with four weeks to comment on the individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether, and for what reasons, it accepts or rejects the adjustment.

Annex 11 TABLE OF CONSERVATIVENESS FACTORS 1. This annex provides a table of conservativeness factors to be used in the calculation of adjustments to ensure that adjusted estimates are conservative, in accordance with paragraph 47 of the technical guidance. These conservativeness factors are provided in two sets: one for use in the calculation of adjustments for a base year estimate and one for the calculation of adjustments for a year of the commitment period. These are provided for activity data, emission factors and emission estimates for each IPCC source category and corresponding gas. 2. When a given source category is not covered in the table, the provision of paragraph 50 of the technical guidance applies, such as for categories “other” under industrial processes, agriculture, waste and the IPCC sector “7 Other”. 3. The conservativeness factors in this table will be updated, as required, following the collective recommendation of lead reviewers, subject to approval by the SBSTA. Background information on the preparation of the table of conservativeness factors 4. The conservativeness factors are derived from uncertainty values and parameters provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, and in some cases are determined by expert judgement for the purpose of this technical guidance, as indicated below: (a) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for a component, this range for that component is used; (b) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for emissions from a particular source or a combined uncertainty range can be calculated from the uncertainty values and/or ranges of the input parameters using the tier 1 method, the range generated by applying the uncertainty value for the source is used; (c) In cases where the [IPCC good practice guidance does not provide an uncertainty range for an estimate or a combined uncertainty range cannot be calculated because necessary information is not available, an assessed uncertainty range determined by expert judgement for the purposes of this technical guidance is used. 5. Different conservativeness factors are provided for use in adjustments to estimate for a base year and for a year of the commitment period. The conservativeness factors are calculated using the 25"" and 75™ percentiles of the range generated by an uncertainty value for the gas and source for use in an adjustment for the base year, and a year of the commitment period, respectively, assuming a log—normal distribution. 6. The uncertainty values have been grouped into five sets of uncertainty bands, with corresponding conservativeness factors, by assigning a given uncertainty values to a given band.
