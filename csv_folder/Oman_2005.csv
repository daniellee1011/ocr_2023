2005,Economic And Social Council,Commission On Human Rights,Sixty-first session,18,EFFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF HUMAN RIGHTS MECHANISMS,"Bangladesh*, Belarus*, Bhutan, Burundi*, Cameroon*, China, Congo, Céte d’Ivoire*, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador*, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of)*, Kenya, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya*, Malaysia, Mauritania, Myanmar*, Nepal, Nigeria, Oman*, Pakistan, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Senegal*, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Syrian Arab Republic*, Togo, Tunisia*, United Republic of Tanzania*, Uruguay*, Venezuela*, Viet Nam*, Yemen*, Zambia* and Zimbabwe",2005,Composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,"The Commission on Human Rights, Recalling that, in its report to the Special Commission of the Economic and Social Council (E/CN.4/1988/85 and Corr.1), the Commission reaffirmed that the paramount consideration for employing staff at every level was the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity and was convinced that this objective was compatible with the principle of equitable geographical distribution and took into account Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, Recalling also Part 11, paragraphs 11 and 17, of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.157/23), in which the World Conference on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General and the General Assembly to provide sufficient human, financial and other resources to the Centre for Human Rights to enable it effectively, efficiently and expeditiously to carry out its activities, while recognizing the necessity for restructuring United Nations human rights machinery, in accordance with its real needs, Reaffirming the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds, as well as of different political, economic and legal systems, Recognizing that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally and that genuine multilingualism promotes unity in diversity and international understanding, Taking into account the need to pay particular attention to the recruitment of personnel for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States, particularly from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, thus improving the present staff composition, based on a more equitable geographical distribution, Reiterating its deep concern that the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/CN.4/2005/109) concerning the geographical composition and the functions of the Office staff clearly reflects that one region is unequivocally overrepresented in the staff composition and that the imbalance still remains (see the annexes to the present resolution), Expressing again its concern over the non-representation and underrepresentation of several Member States, especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition, on the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner, many of them also non-represented or underrepresented at the level of the whole Secretariat, particularly bearing in mind the criteria of equitable geographical distribution, Expressing its concern also that the prevalence of project personnel has skewed the geographical distribution of the staff of the Office towards Western Europe and North America, compared to the Secretariat-wide pattern, as has the geographical distribution of consultants, Noting with grave concern that the dependency of the Office on extrabudgetary resources is at the heart of the imbalance in the composition of its staff, 1. Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures proposed or implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation for the last few years; 2. Welcomes the fact that the High Commissioner recently submitted a comprehensive proposal to the Office of Human Resources Management that will effectively discontinue the practice of hiring temporary staff for regular functions of the Office of the High Commissioner through the regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field to align the recruitment policy of the Office with that of the United Nations Secretariat; 3. Regrets that most of the measures described therein are not new and, as the statistics show, they are either inadequate or inadequately or insufficiently applied and they have failed to produce any concrete improvement in the geographical distribution of the staff of the Office to date, and that the report does not provide for specific targets and deadlines to be achieved in order to reduce the current imbalance in the staff, as requested in paragraph 23 (a) of Commission resolution 2004/73; 4. Expresses its concern that, while nationals of 30 out of 43 developed countries are represented in the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the overwhelming majority of developing countries, 102 out of 148, have not a single national on the staff of the Office, despite the fact that 13 out of 15 unrepresented countries and 6 out of the 5. Also expresses its concern that the number of nationals of most of the developed countries overrepresented, underrepresented or within range at the level of the whole Secretariat outnumber by many times the average number of nationals of individual developing countries represented on the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 6. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 7. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU/REP/2003/6) that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner; 8. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than in those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 9. Takes note with appreciation that the recommendations for the selection of staff for technical cooperation activities and advisory services will be subject to the review of the Office’s internal Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues and that the composition of the Panel has been reviewed to balance its geographical distribution, as requested by Commission resolution 2004/73, and requests the High Commissioner to ensure that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general and to report to the Commission on the current composition of the Panel; 10. Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from unrepresented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive 10. examinations; 11. Welcomes the statement in the report that the Office of the High Commissioner has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts, involving the screening of candidates at the initial recruitment stage, including of short-term staff, to ensure that, between equally qualified candidates, priority is given to candidates from such countries, but regrets that in the last year there has been a further increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from one regional group, enlarging the existing chronic geographical imbalance, and requests the High Commissioner to use the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 11. 12. Also welcomes the assurance of the High Commissioner that she attaches the utmost importance to equitable geographical representation, as well as to the need for the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity on the part of the staff of her Office and the fact that the High Commissioner has paid particular attention to geographical diversity in the recruitment of the senior managers, since four out of seven posts subject to geographical distribution at the D-1 level and above are encumbered by staff from developing countries; 12. 13. Expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 13. discontinued; 14. Stresses that the proposal made in the last year by the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and is, therefore, unacceptable; 14. 15. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, 15. furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office at Geneva; 16. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 17. Also reiterates that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 17. 18. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from unrepresented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 18. 19. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 19. 20. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 20. 21. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 21. 22. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 22. 23. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 23. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 24. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of her mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 24. 25. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 25. Requests the High Commissioner: 26. (a) To ensure that the one-time post regularization of all core posts at headquarters and in the field results in a new and balanced geographical distribution of the staff of the Office, advertising the posts to be regularized and filling them in a transparent and competitive manner, following United Nations practices and provisions; (b) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (c) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; (d) To use also the programmes and funds for technical cooperation and human rights education for the training of national technical personnel in developing countries and countries with economies in transition through the use of Junior Professional Officers from these countries, with a view to guaranteeing that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers and that every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; (e) To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-second session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 27. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 28. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled “Management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights”, in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 28. 29. Recalls its request to the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other United Nations intergovernmental bodies regarding the management, programmes and administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; 29.

Annex Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime Objectives 1. The present Guidelines on Justice for Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime set forth good practice based on the consensus of contemporary knowledge and relevant international and regional norms, standards and principles. 2. The Guidelines should be implemented in accordance with relevant national legislation and judicial procedures as well as take into consideration legal, social, economic, cultural and geographical conditions. However, States should constantly endeavour to overcome practical difficulties in the application of the Guidelines. 3. The Guidelines provide a practical framework to achieve the following objectives: (a) To assist in the review of national and domestic laws, procedures and practices so that these ensure full respect for the rights of child victims and E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 witnesses of crime and contribute to the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,3 by parties to that Convention; (b) To assist Governments, international organizations, public agencies, non- governmental and community-based organizations and other interested parties in designing and implementing legislation, policy, programmes and practices that address key issues related to child victims and witnesses of crime; (c) To guide professionals and, where appropriate, volunteers working with child victims and witnesses of crime in their day-to-day practice in the adult and juvenile justice process at the national, regional and international levels, consistent with the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power;* (d) To assist and support those caring for children in dealing sensitively with child victims and witnesses of crime. 4. In implementing the Guidelines, each jurisdiction should ensure that adequate training, selection and procedures are put in place to protect and meet the special needs of child victims and witnesses of crime, where the nature of the victimization affects categories of children differently, such as sexual assault of children, especially girls. 5. The Guidelines cover a field in which knowledge and practice are growing and improving. They are neither intended to be exhaustive nor to preclude further development, provided it is in harmony with their underlying objectives and principles. 6. The Guidelines could also be applied to processes in informal and customary systems of justice such as restorative justice and in non-criminal fields of law including, but not limited to, custody, divorce, adoption, child protection, mental health, citizenship, immigration and refugee law. II. Special considerations 7. The Guidelines were developed: (a) Cognizant that millions of children throughout the world suffer harm as a result of crime and abuse of power and that the rights of those children have not been adequately recognized and that they may suffer additional hardship when assisting in the justice process; (b) Recognizing that children are vulnerable and require special protection appropriate to their age, level of maturity and individual special needs; (c) Recognizing that girls are particularly vulnerable and may face discrimination at all stages of the justice system; (d) Reaffirming that every effort must be made to prevent victimization of children, including, among other things, through implementation of the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime;> 3 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1577, No. 27531. 4 General Assembly resolution 40/34, annex. 5 Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 (e) Cognizant that children who are victims and witnesses may suffer additional hardship if mistakenly viewed as offenders when they are in fact victims and witnesses; (f) Recalling that the Convention on the Rights of the Child sets forth requirements and principles to secure effective recognition of the rights of children and that the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power sets forth principles to provide victims with the right to information, participation, protection, reparation and assistance; (g) Recalling international and regional initiatives that implement the principles of the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, including the Handbook on Justice for Victims and the Guide for Policy Makers on the Declaration of Basic Principles, both issued by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention in 1999; (h) Recognizing the efforts of the International Bureau for Children’s Rights in laying the groundwork for the development of guidelines on justice for child victims and witnesses of crime; (i) Considering that improved responses to child victims and witnesses of crime can make children and their families more willing to disclose instances of victimization and more supportive of the justice process; (j) Recalling that justice for child victims and witnesses of crime must be assured while safeguarding the rights of accused and convicted offenders; (k) Bearing in mind the variety of legal systems and traditions, and noting that crime is increasingly transnational in nature and that there is a need to ensure that child victims and witnesses of crime receive equivalent protection in all countries. III. Principles 8. As stated in international instruments and in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child as reflected in the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and in order to ensure justice for child victims and witnesses of crime, professionals and others responsible for the well-being of those children must respect the following cross-cutting principles: (a) Dignity. Every child is a unique and valuable human being and as such his or her individual dignity, special needs, interests and privacy should be respected and protected; (b) Non-discrimination. Every child has the right to be treated fairly and equally, regardless of his or her or the parent or legal guardian’s race, ethnicity, colour, gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability and birth or other status; (c) Best interests of the child. While the rights of accused and convicted offenders should be safeguarded, every child has the right to have his or her best interests given primary consideration. This includes the right to protection and to a chance for harmonious development: E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 (i) Protection. Every child has the right to life and survival and to be shielded from any form of hardship, abuse or neglect, including physical, psychological, mental and emotional abuse and neglect; (i1) Harmonious development. Every child has the right to a chance for harmonious development and to a standard of living adequate for physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social growth. In the case of a child who has been traumatized, every step should be taken to enable the child to enjoy healthy development; (d) Right to participation. Every child has, subject to national procedural law, the right to express his or her views, opinions and beliefs freely, in his or her own words, and to contribute especially to the decisions affecting his or her life, including those taken in any judicial processes, and to have those views taken into consideration according to his or her abilities, age, intellectual maturity and evolving capacity. Iv. Definitions 9. Throughout these Guidelines, the following definitions apply: (a) “Child victims and witnesses” denotes children and adolescents, under the age of 18, who are victims of crime or witnesses to crime regardless of their role in the offence or in the prosecution of the alleged offender or groups of offenders; (b) “Professionals” refers to persons who, within the context of their work, are in contact with child victims and witnesses of crime or are responsible for addressing the needs of children in the justice system and for whom these Guidelines are applicable. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: child and victim advocates and support persons; child protection service practitioners; child welfare agency staff; prosecutors and, where appropriate, defence lawyers; diplomatic and consular staff; domestic violence programme staff; judges; court staff; law enforcement officials; medical and mental health professionals; and social workers; (c) “Justice process” encompasses detection of the crime, making of the complaint, investigation, prosecution and trial and post-trial procedures, regardless of whether the case is handled in a national, international or regional criminal justice system for adults or juveniles, or in a customary or informal system of justice; (d) “Child-sensitive” denotes an approach that balances the child’s right to protection and that takes into account the child’s individual needs and views. The right to be treated with dignity and compassion 10. Child victims and witnesses should be treated in a caring and sensitive manner throughout the justice process, taking into account their personal situation and immediate needs, age, gender, disability and level of maturity and fully respecting their physical, mental and moral integrity. 11. Every child should be treated as an individual with his or her individual needs, wishes and feelings. E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 12. Interference in the child’s private life should be limited to the minimum needed at the same time as high standards of evidence collection are maintained in order to ensure fair and equitable outcomes of the justice process. 13. In order to avoid further hardship to the child, interviews, examinations and other forms of investigation should be conducted by trained professionals who proceed in a sensitive, respectful and thorough manner. 14. All interactions described in these Guidelines should be conducted in a child- sensitive manner in a suitable environment that accommodates the special needs of the child, according to his or her abilities, age, intellectual maturity and evolving capacity. They should also take place in a language that the child uses and understands. VL The right to be protected from discrimination 15. Child victims and witnesses should have access to a justice process that protects them from discrimination based on the child’s, parent’s or legal guardian’s race, colour, gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability and birth or other status. 16. The justice process and support services available to child victims and witnesses and their families should be sensitive to the child’s age, wishes, understanding, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic, cultural, religious, linguistic and social background, caste, socio-economic condition and immigration or refugee status, as well as to the special needs of the child, including health, abilities and capacities. Professionals should be trained and educated about such differences. 17. In certain cases, special services and protection will need to be instituted to take account of gender and the different nature of specific offences against children, such as sexual assault involving children. 18. Age should not be a barrier to a child’s right to participate fully in the justice process. Every child should be treated as a capable witness, subject to examination, and his or her testimony should not be presumed invalid or untrustworthy by reason of the child’s age alone as long as his or her age and maturity allow the giving of intelligible and credible testimony, with or without communication aids and other assistance. VII. The right to be informed 19. Child victims and witnesses, their parents or guardians and legal representatives, from their first contact with the justice process and throughout that process, should be promptly and adequately informed, to the extent feasible and appropriate, of, inter alia: (a) The availability of health, psychological, social and other relevant services as well as the means of accessing such services along with legal or other advice or representation, compensation and emergency financial support, where applicable; (b) The procedures for the adult and juvenile criminal justice process, including the role of child victims and witnesses, the importance, timing and E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 manner of testimony, and ways in which “questioning” will be conducted during the investigation and trial; (c) The existing support mechanisms for the child when making a complaint and participating in the investigation and court proceedings; (d) The specific places and times of hearings and other relevant events; (e) The availability of protective measures; (f) The existing mechanisms for review of decisions affecting child victims and witnesses; (g) The relevant rights for child victims and witnesses pursuant to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. 20. In addition, child victims, their parents or guardians and legal representatives should be promptly and adequately informed, to the extent feasible and appropriate, of: (a) The progress and disposition of the specific case, including the apprehension, arrest and custodial status of the accused and any pending changes to that status, the prosecutorial decision and relevant post-trial developments and the outcome of the case; (b) The existing opportunities to obtain reparation from the offender or from the State through the justice process, through alternative civil proceedings or through other processes. VIIIL. The right to be heard and to express views and concerns 21. Professionals should make every effort to enable child victims and witnesses to express their views and concerns related to their involvement in the justice process, including by: (a) Ensuring that child victims and where appropriate witnesses are consulted on the matters set forth in paragraph 19 above; (b) Ensuring that child victims and witnesses are enabled to express freely and in their own manner their views and concerns regarding their involvement in the justice process, their concerns regarding safety in relation to the accused, the manner in which they prefer to provide testimony and their feelings about the conclusions of the process; (c) Giving due regard to the child’s views and concerns and, if they are unable to accommodate them, explain the reasons to the child. IX. The right to effective assistance 22. Child victims and witnesses and, where appropriate, family members should have access to assistance provided by professionals who have received relevant training as set out in paragraphs 40-42 below. This may include assistance and support services such as financial, legal, counselling, health, social and educational services, physical and psychological recovery services and other services necessary E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 for the child’s reintegration. All such assistance should address the child’s needs and enable him or her to participate effectively at all stages of the justice process. 23. In assisting child victims and witnesses, professionals should make every effort to coordinate support so that the child is not subjected to excessive interventions. 24. Child victims and witnesses should receive assistance from support persons, such as child victim/witness specialists, commencing at the initial report and continuing until such services are no longer required. 25. Professionals should develop and implement measures to make it easier for children to testify or give evidence to improve communication and understanding at the pre-trial and trial stages. These measures may include: (a) Child victim and witness specialists to address the child’s special needs; (b) Support persons, including specialists and appropriate family members to accompany the child during testimony; (c) Where appropriate, to appoint guardians to protect the child’s legal interests. The right to privacy 26. Child victims and witnesses should have their privacy protected as a matter of primary importance. 27. Information relating to a child’s involvement in the justice process should be protected. This can be achieved through maintaining confidentiality and restricting disclosure of information that may lead to identification of a child who is a victim or witness in the justice process. 28. Measures should be taken to protect children from undue exposure to the public by, for example, excluding the public and the media from the courtroom during the child’s testimony, where permitted by national law. XI. The right to be protected from hardship during the justice process 29. Professionals should take measures to prevent hardship during the detection, investigation and prosecution process in order to ensure that the best interests and dignity of child victims and witnesses are respected. 30. Professionals should approach child victims and witnesses with sensitivity, so that they: (a) Provide support for child victims and witnesses, including accompanying the child throughout his or her involvement in the justice process, when it is in his or her best interests; (b) Provide certainty about the process, including providing child victims and witnesses with clear expectations as to what to expect in the process, with as much certainty as possible. The child’s participation in hearings and trials should be planned ahead of time and every effort should be made to ensure continuity in the relationships between children and the professionals in contact with them throughout the process; E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 (c) Ensure that trials take place as soon as practical, unless delays are in the child’s best interest. Investigation of crimes involving child victims and witnesses should also be expedited and there should be procedures, laws or court rules that provide for cases involving child victims and witnesses to be expedited; (d) Use child-sensitive procedures, including interview rooms designed for children, interdisciplinary services for child victims integrated in the same location, modified court environments that take child witnesses into consideration, recesses during a child’s testimony, hearings scheduled at times of day appropriate to the age and maturity of the child, an appropriate notification system to ensure the child goes to court only when necessary and other appropriate measures to facilitate the child’s testimony. 31. Professionals should also implement measures: (a) To limit the number of interviews: special procedures for collection of evidence from child victims and witnesses should be implemented in order to reduce the number of interviews, statements, hearings and, specifically, unnecessary contact with the justice process, such as through use of video recording; (b) To ensure that child victims and witnesses are protected, if compatible with the legal system and with due respect for the rights of the defence, from being cross-examined by the alleged perpetrator: as necessary, child victims and witnesses should be interviewed, and examined in court, out of sight of the alleged perpetrator, and separate courthouse waiting rooms and private interview areas should be provided; (c) To ensure that child victims and witnesses are questioned in a child- sensitive manner and allow for the exercise of supervision by judges, facilitate testimony and reduce potential intimidation, for example by using testimonial aids or appointing psychological experts. XII. The right to safety 32. Where the safety of a child victim or witness may be at risk, appropriate measures should be taken to require the reporting of those safety risks to appropriate authorities and to protect the child from such risk before, during and after the justice process. 33. Professionals who come into contact with children should be required to notify appropriate authorities if they suspect that a child victim or witness has been harmed, is being harmed or is likely to be harmed. 34. Professionals should be trained in recognizing and preventing intimidation, threats and harm to child victims and witnesses. Where child victims and witnesses may be the subject of intimidation, threats or harm, appropriate conditions should be put in place to ensure the safety of the child. Such safeguards could include: (a) Avoiding direct contact between child victims and witnesses and the alleged perpetrators at any point in the justice process; (b) Using court-ordered restraining orders supported by a registry system; (c) Ordering pre-trial detention of the accused and setting special “no contact” bail conditions; 10 (d) Placing the accused under house arrest; (e) Wherever possible and appropriate, giving child victims and witnesses protection by the police or other relevant agencies and safeguarding their whereabouts from disclosure. XIII. The right to reparation 35. Child victims should, wherever possible, receive reparation in order to achieve full redress, reintegration and recovery. Procedures for obtaining and enforcing reparation should be readily accessible and child-sensitive. 36. Provided the proceedings are child-sensitive and respect these Guidelines, combined criminal and reparations proceedings should be encouraged, together with informal and community justice procedures such as restorative justice. 37. Reparation may include restitution from the offender ordered in the criminal court, aid from victim compensation programmes administered by the State and damages ordered to be paid in civil proceedings. Where possible, costs of social and educational reintegration, medical treatment, mental health care and legal services should be addressed. Procedures should be instituted to ensure enforcement of reparation orders and payment of reparation before fines. XIV. The right to special preventive measures 38. In addition to preventive measures that should be in place for all children, special strategies are required for child victims and witnesses who are particularly vulnerable to recurring victimization or offending. 39. Professionals should develop and implement comprehensive and specially tailored strategies and interventions in cases where there are risks that child victims may be victimized further. These strategies and interventions should take into account the nature of the victimization, including victimization related to abuse in the home, sexual exploitation, abuse in institutional settings and trafficking. The strategies may include those based on government, neighbourhood and citizen initiatives. XV. Implementation 40.
