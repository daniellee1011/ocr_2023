to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of refraining from unilateral measures that are not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations and that endanger food security, Convinced that each State should adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made on reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Concerned by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis are not over and that they continue to have serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, Noting that environmental degradation, desertification and global climate change are factors contributing to destitution and desperation and have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food, in particular in developing countries, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food security, in particular in developing countries, GE. 10-12333 A/HRC/13/L.17 Stressing the importance of reversing the continuing decline of official development assistance devoted to agriculture, both in real terms and as a share of total official development assistance, Recalling the pledges made to increase official development assistance devoted to

relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Recalling its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council, and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, 1.

Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7.

Stresses that improving access to productive resources and investment in rural development is essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate, small- scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 15. Recognizes that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, and that these people are GE. 10-12333 A/HRC/13/L.17 especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of various inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises is a key element to food security and provision of the right to food; 16. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 17. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 18. Requests all States and private actors, as well as international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in ongoing negotiations in different fields; 19. Encourages all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a human rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security; 20. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food and, in particular, to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 21. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 22. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in order to enhance the contribution development cooperation and food aid to the realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all stakeholders; 23. Stresses that all States should make every effort to ensure that their international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 24.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 27. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 28. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance, as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 29. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to promote such policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 30.

Stresses the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation in the protection of the human rights of migrants, and therefore: (a) Encourages States to participate in international and regional dialogues on migration that include countries of origin, transit and destination, and invites them to consider negotiating bilateral and regional agreements on migrant workers within the framework of applicable human rights law and designing and implementing programmes with States of other regions to protect the rights of migrants; (b) Also encourages States to take the necessary measures to achieve policy coherence on migration at the national, regional and international levels, including by ensuring coordinated child protection policies and systems across borders that are in full compliance with international human rights law; (c) Further encourages States to strengthen further their cooperation in protecting witnesses and victims of smugglers and traffickers; A/HRC/15/L.8/Rev.1 (d) Encourages States to allow persons claiming to be in need of protection to enter without delay the applicable national procedure for protection, including the national asylum procedure, in the country where they are present; 14.

S/2010/632 Annex Letter dated 8 December 2010 from the Prime Minister of Iraq addressed to the President of the Security Council I should like to refer to my letter dated 13 December 2009 addressed to the President of the Security Council, in which I explained that in 2010 the Government of Iraq would put in place appropriate arrangements, in keeping with the Constitution, for the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, with a view to ensuring the continued equitable use of oil revenue in the interests of the Iraqi people, in accordance with international best practices with regard to transparency, accountability and integrity. Pursuant to Security Council resolution 1905 (2009), the Government of Iraq submitted in its first quarterly report the requisite action plan and timeline for the transition to the successor arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board. It subsequently submitted its second and third reports on the progress that had been made. In the third report, details were given of the parts of the action plan that had been completed and those that remained incomplete. Reference was also made to the situation in Iraq and the fact that the delay in the formation of a new Government after the legislative elections that took place on 7 March 2010 had, in one way or another, affected the ability of Government institutions to take rapid and effective action with regard to the comprehensive implementation of the action plan. On the basis of the foregoing, and in order to make it possible to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the action plan and a smooth transition to the successor arrangements, the Government of Iraq is once more in need of the assistance of the international community. It therefore hopes that the Security Council will extend for a further and final six months immunity for the Development Fund for Iraq, on the basis of the arrangements set forth in Security Council resolution 1483 (2003), paragraph 20. I should be grateful if you would circulate this letter to the members of the Council with the greatest possible expedition and include it as an annex to the resolution currently being ed on Iraq.
