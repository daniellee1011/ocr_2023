fact that, when designing and implementing strategies, policies and measures to address gross violations and abuses of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and A/HRC/33/L.10 crimes against humanity, the specific context of each situation must be taken into account with a view to preventing the recurrence of future violations and to ensure social cohesion, nation-building, ownership and inclusiveness at the national level and local levels with a view to promoting reconciliation, Emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to transitional justice incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, including, among others, individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, vetting of public employees and officials, memorialization initiatives, and processes to achieve shared narratives or an appropriately conceived combination thereof, in order to,

Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide and the Responsibility to Protect, including the Framework of Analysis for Atrocity Crimes as one of the tools to assess the risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in any situation, 1. Reiterates the responsibility of each individual State to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, which entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary means; 2. Condemns impunity for gross violations and abuses of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law, including genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, emphasizes the responsibility of States to comply with their obligations under international law to end impunity, and urges States to seek sustainable peace, justice, truth and reconciliation through comprehensive transitional justice strategies, in particular to investigate thoroughly and prosecute those responsible for such violations and crimes, in order to avoid their recurrence and promote reconciliation at the national level; 3. Acknowledges the significant progress made by the international community, including within the United Nations system, in developing relevant mechanisms and practices to prevent incitement to and commission of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, the development of comprehensive transitional justice strategies, including the punishment of gross violations and abuses of human rights and serious violations of international humanitarian law, and emphasizes in this context the important role of national, subregional, regional and international efforts to prevent and address the legacy of these crimes and violations and therefore the necessity to strengthen the capacity of domestic efforts, jurisdictions and inter-State cooperation; 4.

Reaffirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peacebuilding, and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in the design, establishment and implementation of comprehensive transitional justice strategies; 7.
