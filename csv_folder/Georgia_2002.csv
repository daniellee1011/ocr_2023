I, resolution 1), Governments committed themselves to endeavouring to ensure that all men and women, especially those living in poverty, could exercise the rights, utilize the resources and share the responsibilities that would enable them to lead satisfying lives and to contribute to the well-being of their families, their communities and humankind and committed themselves to the goal of eradicating poverty throughout the world through national actions and international cooperation, as an ethical, social, political and economic imperative of humankind, Recalling the report of the Secretary-General on women’s real enjoyment of their human rights, in particular those relating to the elimination of poverty, economic development and economic resources (E/CN.4/1998/22-E/CN.6/1998/11), Noting with satisfaction resolution 2001/34, on women’s equal ownership of, access to and control over land and the equal rights to own property and to adequate housing, adopted by the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session, which recognizes that restrictions on women’s equal access to credit and loans and factors preventing them from owning and inheriting land may contribute to the feminization of poverty, Recalling the Declaration of the Microcredit Summit, held in Washington, D.C., in February 1997, which launched a global campaign to reach one hundred million of the world’s poorest families, especially women, with credit for self-employment by the year 2005, Noting with interest the statement adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 4 May 2001, aimed at encouraging the integration of human rights into poverty eradication policies by outlining how human rights generally, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in particular, can empower the poor and enhance anti-poverty strategies, Also noting with interest the report submitted by the independent expert pursuant to Commission resolution 2001/31 of 23 April 2001 (E/CN.4/2002/55) and the recommendations the expert makes, inter alia on the introduction of decentralization policies suited to the needs and particular characteristics of men and women living in extreme poverty, on giving them greater representation on national human rights bodies, on establishing civil registry services where necessary to provide better safeguards for their legal rights, including their right to be recognized as persons before the law, to own property and to inherit, and on giving them better access to the justice system, Noting resolution 2001/8 of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (E/CN.4/2002/2), which designates experts to prepare a working paper on the need to develop guiding principles on the implementation of existing human rights norms and standards in the context of the fight against extreme poverty, and encouraging the experts to continue to cooperate with the independent expert, 1. Reaffirms that: (a) Extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate them; (b) The right to life includes within it existence in human dignity with the minimum necessities of life; (c) The existence of widespread absolute poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and renders democracy and popular participation fragile; (d) For peace and stability to endure, national action and international action and cooperation are required to promote a better life for all in larger freedom, a critical element of which is the eradication of poverty; (e) Political commitment, social justice and equal access to social services are conditions sine qua non for the eradication of poverty, and welcomes in this connection the fact that States and international organizations have never been so aware of the urgency of winning the battle against extreme poverty; )] It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the societies in which they live and in the realization of human rights, and for people living in poverty and vulnerable groups to be empowered to help plan, implement and evaluate policies that affect them, thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development; (2) Special attention must be given to the plight of women, particularly older women and women alone at home, and children, who often bear the greatest burden of extreme poverty; 2. Recalls that: (a) The Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development, reaffirmed during the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly on the follow-up to the World Summit, held in Geneva in June 2000, provide the substantive framework for eradicating poverty by setting specific targets, drawing up plans and implementing programmes; (b) To ensure the protection of the rights of all individuals, non-discrimination towards the poorest and the full exercise of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, a better understanding is needed of what is endured by people living in poverty, including women and children, and that thought must be given to the subject, drawing on the experience and ideas communicated by the poorest themselves and by those committed to working alongside them; (c) In its resolution 1997/11 of 3 April 1997, it requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to give high priority to the question of human rights and extreme poverty, to ensure better cooperation between the institutions and bodies involved, regularly to inform the General Assembly of the evolution of the question and to submit specific information on this question at events such as the evaluation, at the halfway point in 2002 and the end-point in 2007, of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty; (d) In her report to the General Assembly of 11 September 1998 on the mid-term evaluation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/53/372, annex), the High Commissioner proposed that the Second and Third Committees of the General Assembly should work jointly to implement the right to development by focusing on the elimination of poverty, with particular emphasis placed on basic security, which is necessary to enable individuals and families to enjoy fundamental rights and assume basic responsibilities; 3. Acknowledges the efforts made by developing countries, in particular the commitment and determination of Africa’s leaders to tackle seriously the problems of poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion, economic disparities, instability and insecurity by means of initiatives such as the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (formerly known as the New Africa Initiative) and other innovative mechanisms such as the World Solidarity Fund for the Eradication of Poverty, and calls upon developed countries, the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the international financial institutions to provide, through their operational programmes, new and additional financial resources, as appropriate, to support these initiatives; 4. Welcomes the increasing number of events associated with the celebration, on 17 October of each year, of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty and the opportunity which these events provide to people and populations living in extreme poverty to make their voices heard; 5. Expresses its appreciation: (a) That an integrated approach is being followed by the United Nations system in addressing the question of extreme poverty, particularly through the adoption and the implementation of the United Nations action strategy for halving extreme poverty by 2015; (b) That the international financial institutions have developed new policies strengthening the human and social dimension of their action, and encourages them to continue to do so; (c) For the initiatives taken in many countries by national education authorities to raise awareness among all children and young people of the existence of extreme poverty and the urgent need for united action to enable the poorest people to regain their rights; (d) For the priority that the independent expert continues to give to enabling men and women living in extreme poverty to express themselves, and the emphasis in her report on the need for States to take account of their demands in shaping State policies; (e) For the many responses from Governments to the questionnaires sent out by the independent expert to gather views and experiences in the field of human rights and the eradication of extreme poverty; (c) 6.
