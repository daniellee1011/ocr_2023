Secretary-General,' Bearing in mind that weaknesses in crime prevention lead to subsequent difficulties at the level of crime control mechanisms, and bearing in mind also the urgent need to establish effective crime prevention strategies for Africa, as well as the importance of law enforcement agencies and the judiciary at the regional and subregional levels, Aware of the devastating impact of new and more dynamic crime trends on the national economies of African States, such as the high levels of transnational organized crime being recorded in Africa, including the utilization of digital technology to commit all types of cybercrime, and aware also of illicit trafficking in cultural property, drugs, precious metals, rhinoceros horns and ivory, of piracy and money-laundering and of the fact that crime is a major obstacle to harmonious and sustainable development in Africa, Deeply concerned about the growing links, in some cases, between some forms of transnational organized crime and terrorism, and recognizing that countering transnational organized crime and terrorism is a common and shared responsibility, and that criminal justice procedures will have to be more cost- Please recycle eS 16-17720 TT 171016 CAA A A conscious, timely and expeditious and sensitive to public responses to minimize or eliminate any suspicion of compromise, Emphasizing that combating crime is a collective endeavour to meet the global challenge of organized crime and that investment of necessary resources in crime prevention is important to that aim and contributes to sustainable development, Noting with concern that in most African countries the existing criminal justice system does not have sufficiently skilled personnel and adequate infrastructure and is therefore ill-equipped to manage the emergence of new crime trends, and acknowledging the challenges that Africa faces in litigation processes and the management of correctional institutions, Recognizing that the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders is a focal point for all professional efforts aimed at promoting the active cooperation and collaboration of Governments, academics, institutions and scientific and professional organizations and experts in crime prevention and criminal justice, Bearing in mind the revised African Union Plan of Action on Drug Control and Crime Prevention (2013-2017), aimed at encouraging Member States to participate in and own the regional initiatives for effective crime prevention and good governance and strengthened justice

problem afflicting Africa, Expressing concern over the continued absence of a director of the Institute, and noting the important role of such senior management positions in ensuring the normal functioning of the Institute, Noting with concern that the financial situation of the Institute has greatly affected its capacity to deliver services to African Member States in an effective and comprehensive manner, and noting that one of the findings of the preliminary diagnostic study is that the Institute urgently needs to increase its income, Recalling the detailed description provided in the report of the Secretary- General of funding deficiencies that have severely undermined the Institute’s capacity to serve the needs of the region, and recognizing that crime results in the expenditure of a significant amount of resources, Bearing in mind that the Institute is an important component of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice network, and that without the necessary funds, the Institute will fail to accomplish its vital goals of combating drug trafficking, cybercrime and environmental crimes, among other challenges, as 2/5 well as its goals of reforming the crucial deficiencies in the region’s prosecution system and building effective and strong alliances among law enforcement personnel, professional bodies, academic institutions, individual

and more dynamic crime trends on the national economies of African States, such as the high levels of transnational organized crime being recorded in Africa, including the utilization of digital
