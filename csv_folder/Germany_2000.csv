Requests the Secretary-General to seek comments from Member States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as the institutes of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network, on the desirability and the means of establishing common principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters, including the advisability of developing an instrument, such as the preliminary declaration annexed to the present resolution, and on the contents of this ; 3.

Annex Preliminary elements of a declaration of basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters Definitions 1. “Restorative justice programme” means any programme that uses restorative processes or aims to achieve restorative outcomes. 2. “Restorative outcome” means an agreement reached as the result of a restorative process. Examples of restorative outcomes include restitution, community service and any other programme or response designed to accomplish reparation of the victim and community, and reintegration of the victim and/or the offender. 3. “Restorative process” means any process in which the victim, the offender and/or any other individuals or community members affected by a crime actively participate together in the resolution of matters arising from the crime, often with the help of a fair and impartial third party. Examples of restorative process include mediation, conferencing and sentencing circles. 4. “Parties” means the victim, the offender and any other individuals or community members affected by a crime who may be involved in a restorative justice programme. 5. “Facilitator” means a fair and impartial third party whose role is to facilitate the participation of victims and offenders in an encounter programme. E/CN.15/2000/L.2/Rev.1 II. Use of restorative justice programmes 6. Restorative justice programmes should be generally available at all stages of the criminal justice process. 7. Restorative processes should be used only with the free and voluntary consent of the parties. The parties should be able to withdraw such consent at any time during the process. Agreements should be arrived at voluntarily by the parties and contain only reasonable and proportionate obligations. 8. All parties should normally acknowledge the basic facts of a case as a basis for participation in a restorative process. Participation should not be used as evidence of admission of guilt in subsequent legal proceedings. 9. Obvious disparities with respect to factors such as power imbalances and the parties’ age, maturity or intellectual capacity should be taken into consideration in referring a case to and in conducting a restorative process. Similarly, obvious threats to any of the parties’ safety should also be considered in referring any case to and in conducting a restorative process. The views of the parties themselves about the suitability of restorative processes or outcomes should be given great deference in this consideration. 10. Where restorative processes and/or outcomes are not possible, criminal justice officials should do all they can to encourage the offender to take responsibility vis-a-vis the victim and affected communities, and reintegration of the victim and/or offender into the community. III. Operation of restorative justice programmes 11. Guidelines and standards should be established, with legislative authority when necessary, that govern the use of restorative justice programmes. Such guidelines and standards should address: (a) The conditions for the referral of cases to restorative justice programmes; (b) The handling of cases following a restorative process; (c) The qualifications, training and assessment of facilitators; (d) The administration of restorative justice programmes; (e) Standards of competence and ethical rules governing operation of restorative justice programmes. 12. Fundamental procedural safeguards should be applied to restorative justice programmes and in particular to restorative processes: (a) Theparties should have the right to legal advice before and after the restorative process and, where necessary, to translation and/or interpretation. Minors should, in addition, have the right to parental assistance; (b) Before agreeing to participate in restorative processes, the parties should be fully informed of their rights, the nature of the process and the possible consequences of their decision; (c¢) Neither the victim nor the offender should be induced by unfair means to participate in restorative processes or outcomes. E/CN.15/2000/L.2/Rev.1 13. Discussions in restorative processes should be confidential and should not be disclosed subsequently, except with the agreement of the parties. 14. Judicial discharges based on agreements arising out of restorative justice programmes should have the same status as judicial decisions or judgements and should preclude prosecution in respect of the same facts (non bis in idem). 15. Where no agreement can be made between the parties, the case should be referred back to the criminal justice authorities and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Lack of agreement may not be used as justification for a more severe sentence in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. 16. Failure to implement an agreement made in the course of a restorative process should be referred back to the restorative programme or to the criminal justice authorities and a decision as to how to proceed should be taken without delay. Failure to implement the agreement may not be used as justification for a more severe sentence in subsequent criminal justice proceedings. IVv. Facilitators 17. Facilitators should be recruited from all sections of society and should generally possess good understanding of local cultures and communities. They should be able to demonstrate sound judgement and interpersonal skills necessary to conducting restorative processes. 18. Facilitators should perform their duties in an impartial manner, based on the facts of the case and on the needs and wishes of the parties. They should always respect the dignity of the parties and ensure that the parties act with respect towards each other. 19. Facilitators should be responsible for providing a safe and appropriate environment for the restorative process. They should be sensitive to any vulnerability of the parties. 20. Facilitators should receive initial training before taking up facilitation duties and should also receive in-service training. The training should aim at providing skills in conflict resolution, taking into account the particular needs of victims and offenders, at providing basic knowledge of the criminal justice system and at providing a thorough knowledge of the operation of the restorative programme in which they will do their work. Continuing development of restorative justice programmes 21. There should be regular consultation between criminal justice authorities and administrators of restorative justice programmes to develop a common understanding of restorative processes and outcomes, to increase the extent to which restorative programmes are used and to explore ways in which restorative approaches might be incorporated into criminal justice practices. 22. Member States should promote research on and evaluation of restorative justice programmes to assess the extent to which they result in restorative outcomes, serve as an alternative to the criminal justice process and provide positive outcomes for all parties. 23. Restorative justice processes may need to undergo change in concrete form over time. Member States should therefore encourage regular, rigorous evaluation and modification of such programmes in the light of the above definitions.",04/18/2000,2000_423370,Germany,N/A,yes

A/55/L.10 Annex | International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea Trust Fund Terms of reference Reasons for establishing the Trust Fund 1. Part XV of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“the Convention”) provides for the settlement of disputes. In particular, article 287 specifies that States are free to choose one or more of the following means: (a) (b) (c) (d) The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea; The International Court of Justice; An arbitral tribunal; A special arbitral tribunal. 2. The Secretary-General already operates a Trust Fund for the International Court of Justice (see A/47/444). The Permanent Court of Arbitration has established a Financial Assistance Fund. The burden of costs should not be a factor for States, in making the choices under article 287, in deciding whether a dispute should be submitted to the Tribunal, or in deciding upon the response to an application made to the Tribunal by others. For these reasons, it was decided to create a Trust Fund for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (“the Tribunal™). Object and purpose of the Trust Fund 3. This Trust Fund (“the Fund”) is established by the Secretary-General in accordance with General Assembly resolution XXX and pursuant to the Agreement on Cooperation and Relationship between the United Nations and the Tribunal of 18 December 1997 (General Assembly resolution 52/251, annex). 4. The purpose of the Fund is to provide financial assistance to States parties to the Convention for expenses incurred in connection with cases submitted, or to be submitted, to the Tribunal, including its Seabed Disputes Chamber and any other Chamber. 5. Assistance, which will be provided in accordance with the following terms and conditions, should only be provided in appropriate cases, principally those proceeding to the merits where jurisdiction is not an issue, but in exceptional circumstances may be provided for any phase of the proceedings. Contributions to the Fund 6. The Secretary-General invites States, intergovernmental organizations, national institutions, non-governmental organizations, as well as natural and juridical persons, to make voluntary financial contributions to the Fund. Application for assistance 7. An application for assistance from the Fund may be submitted by any State party to the Convention. The application should describe the nature of the case which is to be, or has been, brought by or against the State concerned and should 10 provide an estimate of the costs for which financial assistance is requested. The application should contain a commitment to supply a final statement of account of the expenditures made from approved amounts, to be certified by an auditor acceptable to the United Nations. Panel of experts 8. The Secretary-General will establish a panel of experts, normally three persons of the highest professional standing, to make recommendations on each request. The task of each panel is to examine the application and to recommend to the Secretary- General the amount of the financial assistance to be given, the phase or phases of the proceedings in respect of which assistance is to be given and the types of expenses for which the assistance may be used. Granting of assistance 9. The Secretary-General will provide financial assistance from the Fund on the basis of the recommendations of the panel of experts. Payments will be made against receipts showing expenditures made in respect of approved costs. The latter may include: (a) Preparing the application and the written pleadings; (b) Professional fees of counsel and advocates for written and oral pleadings; (c) Travel and expenses of legal representation in Hamburg during the various phases of a case; (d) Execution of an Order of Judgment of the Tribunal, such as marking a boundary in the territorial sea. Application of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations 10. The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations will apply to the administration of the Fund, including the procedures for audit. Reporting 11. An annual report on the activities of the Fund, including details of the contributions to and disbursements from the Fund, will be made to the Meeting of States Parties to the Convention. Implementing office 12. The Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs is the implementing office for this Fund and provides the services for the operation of the Fund. Offers of professional assistance 13. The implementing office also maintains a list of offers of professional assistance which may be made on a reduced fee basis by suitably qualified persons or bodies. If an applicant for assistance so requests, the implementing office will make the list of offers available to it for its consideration and decision; both 11 financial and other assistance may be extended in respect of the same case or phase thereof. Revision 14. The General Assembly may revise the above if circumstances so require. 12 Annex I1 Trust fund for the purpose of facilitating the preparation of submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, and compliance with article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Terms of reference, guidelines and rules Reasons for establishing the Trust Fund 1. Promoting and developing the marine scientific and technological capacity of developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island States, with a view to accelerating their social and economic development, is essential for the effective implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“the Convention”). 2. Coastal States intending to establish the outer limits of their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of their territorial sea is measured are required by article 76 of the Convention to submit the relevant data and information to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (“the Commission”). In accordance with article 4 of annex II to the Convention, the particulars of such limits should be submitted to the Commission within ten years of the entry into force of the Convention for that State. For some States a submission should be made by 16 November 2004. 3. Developing States, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, may face difficulties in complying with the time limit for submissions to the Commission. The Trust Fund is intended to assist these States in complying with the requirements relating to a submission to the Commission. 4. Under article 3, paragraph 1 (b), of annex II to the Convention, the Commission may provide scientific and technical advice, if requested by the coastal States concerned, during the preparation of the data to be submitted in accordance with article 76. 5. The Commission has adopted an outline for a five-day training course in order to facilitate the preparation of submissions in accordance with its Scientific and Technical Guidelines. The course is to be developed and delivered by interested Governments, international organizations and institutions which possess the necessary expertise and facilities. The Commission has likewise prepared a basic flow chart illustrating the preparation of submissions by coastal States. 6. The delineation of the continental shelf of a coastal State in accordance with article 76 and annex II to the Convention and annex II of the Final Act of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (“the Final Act”) requires a programme for hydrographic and geoscientific surveying and mapping of the continental margin. The complexity and scale, and hence the costs involved, of such a programme will vary greatly from State to State according to the different geographical and geophysical circumstances. A first approach will always involve an assessment of the particular case at hand, followed by planning of appropriate projects for further data acquisition. Such projects require the contracting of high- 13 level scientific/technical expertise and modern technology. By nature, the costs involved in such data acquisition projects are substantial. In addition to contributing to the Voluntary Fund herein established, the international community should make every effort to facilitate the full implementation of article 76 both financially and in any other possible way or capacity. 7. The initial assessment and the project planning itself will require qualifications in hydrography and geosciences in addition to a full understanding of the relevant provisions of the Convention. The final preparation of a submission to the Commission also requires high-level expertise in geosciences and hydrography. 8. The United Nations has extensive experience in providing assistance to countries for their industrial and economic development. This experience could be extended and utilized to assist States in implementing their rights and obligations under article 76 of the Convention. Objects and purpose of the Trust Fund 9. The Secretary-General, under the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, establishes the present Trust Fund (“the Fund”). The object of the Fund is to enable developing States, in particular the least developed coastal countries and small island developing States, to make an initial assessment of their particular case, make appropriate plans for further investigations and data acquisition, and to prepare the final submission documents when the necessary data have been acquired. 10. The data acquisition campaigns themselves are not the object of the Fund. 11. An initial assessment of the nature of the continental shelf of a coastal State is often made in the form of a desktop study, which is a review and compilation of all existing data and information. Decisions for further action and/or planning for further data acquisition and mapping projects will be based on such a study. 12. The purpose of the Fund is to provide, in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations: (a) Training to the appropriate technical and administrative staff of the coastal State in question, in order to enable them to perform initial desktop studies and project planning, or at least to take full part in these activities; (b) Funds for such studies and planning activities, including funds for advisory/consultancy assistance if needed. 13. The preparation of the final submission documents will have to meet the requirements of article 76 and annex II to the Convention (and for some States, annex II of the Final Act) and the Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission. The training should take this into account and aim at enabling the State’s personnel also to prepare most of these documents themselves. The preparation of the submission may induce costs that may be met by funds from the Fund (e.g. software and hardware equipment, technical assistance, etc.). 14 Contributions to the Fund 14. The Secretary-General invites States, intergovernmental organizations and agencies, national institutions, non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions as well as natural and juridical persons to make voluntary financial or other contributions to the Fund. Application for financial assistance 15. An application for financial assistance from the Fund may be submitted by any developing State, in particular the least developed countries and small island developing States, who are Members of the United Nations and party to the Convention. 16. The purpose of the financial assistance applied for should be specified. Financial assistance may be sought for the following purposes: (a) Training of technical and administrative staff; (b) Desktop study or other means to make an initial assessment of the nature of the continental shelf and its limits; (c) Working out plans for the acquisition of necessary additional data and mapping projects; (d) Preparation of final submission documents; (e) Advisory/consultancy assistance related to the above points. 17. Detailed information under each of these purposes should be provided as follows: (a) Training of technical and administrative staff The application shall be accompanied by: (i) A specification of the goal of the training and which positions the trainees are intended to fill afterwards; (i1) Information on the training institute(s) in question; (iii) A copy of the training course(s); (iv) The curriculum vitae of the trainees; (v) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. (b) Desktop study or other means to make an assessment of the nature of the continental shelf and its limits The application shall be accompanied by: (1) A short description of the aim of the study; (i) An overview map of the area in question; (iii) An overview, as complete as possible, of the database already available to the State; 15 (c) (iv) An outline of how the work will be done and what tools are available (software and hardware); (v) A specification of what will be done by the State’s own staff, and what will be contracted for; (vi) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. Working out plans for the acquisition of necessary additional data and mapping projects (d) (e) The application shall be accompanied by: (1) A summary of the status of knowledge of the continental margin, preferably based on a previous desktop study; (1)) A preliminary assessment of the needs for specific additional data and/or information in accordance with the requirements of article 76 and annex II to the Convention, and annex II of the Final Act; (iii) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. Preparation of final submission documents The application shall be accompanied by: (i) A specification of what kind of assistance is needed; (1)) An itemized statement of the estimated costs for which assistance is requested. Advisory/consultancy assistance related to the above points The application shall be accompanied by: (i) A copy of the contract between the Government and the technical or scientific expert in question; (1)) An itemized statement of the costs for which assistance is requested. 18. In all these cases the application shall be accompanied by an undertaking that the requesting State shall supply a final statement of account providing details of the expenditures made from the approved amounts, to be certified by an auditor acceptable to the United Nations. Consideration of applications 19. Each request for financial assistance shall be considered by the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of Legal Affairs (“the Division”), which acts as the secretariat of the Commission. 20. The Division may engage an independent panel of experts of the highest moral standing to assist in the examination of applications on the basis of section 4 above and to recommend the amount of financial assistance to be given. However, no sitting Commission member should serve on this panel of experts. The Division shall prepare and circulate to member States a list of prospective members of the 16 panel of experts. Any member of the expert panel opposed by a member State should not be included in the panel. The Division shall on an annual basis provide a list of the panel of experts as an annex to the Secretary-General’s annual report. 21. In considering the application, the Division shall be guided solely by the financial needs of the requesting developing State and availability of funds with priority given to least developed countries and small island developing States taking into account the imminence of pending deadlines. 22. Travel expenses and subsistence allowance are payable to independent experts engaged by the Division to consider applications. Granting of assistance 23. The Secretary-General will provide financial assistance from the Fund on the basis of the evaluation and recommendations of the Division. Payments will be made against receipts evidencing actual expenditures for approved costs. Application of article 5 of annex II to the Convention 24. Nationals of the coastal State making the submission who are members of the Commission and any Commission member who has assisted a coastal State by providing scientific and technical advice with respect to the delineation shall not be a member of the subcommission dealing with that submission but has the right to participate as a member in the proceedings of the Commission concerning the said submission. In an effort to promote transparency and to give full effect to article 5 of annex II to the Convention there should be full disclosure by Commission members, trust fund recipients and training sponsors to the Division of any pre- submission contacts. Reporting requirements for full disclosure 25. Interested Governments, international organizations and institutions who provide any training for which any costs are reimbursed by this Fund are strongly encouraged to provide the complete list of participants to the Division. 26. Commission members who participate in any activities pursuant to this Fund shall disclose this information to the Division. 27. Upon submission to the Commission of its information on the limits of its continental shelf pursuant to article 76 of the Convention, a coastal State that has received assistance from this Fund shall disclose this information, including the involvement of any Commission members. Application of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations 28. The Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations shall apply to the administration of the Fund. The Fund shall be subject to the auditing procedures provided therein. 10. Reporting to the General Assembly 29. An annual report on the activities of the Fund, including details of the contributions to and disbursements from the Fund, will be made to the General Assembly. 17 11. Implementing office 30.

Requests the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice to elaborate, for consideration at its __ session, the reporting requirements, including standard formats where appropriate, to be included in the guidelines for the preparation of information under Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol, to be recommended for adoption by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, at its first session, on the following issues:","(a) (b) 3. Invites the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to perform the following tasks, with a view to submitting the results to the Conference of the Parties (COP) for consideration at its eighth session: (a) Elaborate methods to account for changes in carbon stocks and emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting from activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol on the basis of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and taking into consideration all guidance contained in the annex to decision -/CMP.1; (b) Prepare a report on good practice guidance and uncertainty management related to verification, measurement, estimation, assessment of uncertainties, monitoring and reporting of net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the land-use, land-use change and forestry sector; () Prepare guidance on methodologies for the possible inclusion of activities of degradation and/or aggradation under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol; Develop definitions of a forest appropriate to each forest biome.] (d) [Draft decision -/CMP.1 Land-use, land-use change and forestry The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, Recalling Atticles 2 and 3 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and Articles 2.1(a), 3.3, 3.4 and 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol, Further recalling decisions 1/CP.4, 8/CP.4, 9/CP.4 and 16/CP.5 of the Conference of the Parties, Affirming that: (a) Any land-use, land-use change and forestry activity carried out in addition to the commitments made under Article 4.1(d) of the Convention for the purposes of determining compliance of Annex I Parties with their quantitative emission limitation and reduction objectives under the Kyoto Protocol, must not change the global effect of the Kyoto Protocol, which is to mitigate climate change in the first commitment period by reducing anthropogenic emissions by sources minus removals by sinks covered by Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol by an aggregate proportion of at least 5 per cent with reference to their 1990 levels, in accordance with Article 3.1 of the Kyoto Protocol, including the use of project-based mechanisms; (b) Any land-use, land-use change and forestry activity, for the purposes of determining compliance of Annex I Parties with their quantitative emission limitation and reduction objectives, must not result in an increase of anthropogenic emissions by sources minus removals by sinks deriving from application of removals by sinks from carbon dioxide and indirect nitrogen fertilization effects; (c) In view of the impact of climate change on forests and desertification, forest conservation and rehabilitation of degraded vegetation cover are important climate change adaptation activities, and as such must be included among those activities to benefit from the share of proceeds of the mechanisms of the Protocol intended to meet the cost of adaptation. This is without prejudice to decisions on the inclusion of land-use, land-use change and forestry activities in the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol; (d) The rules for the inclusion of land-use, land-use change and forestry activities in the accounting of Annex I countries, for purposes of compliance with their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, must not imply a transfer of such commitments to a future commitment period; (e) Carbon removed by land-use, land-use change and forestry activities shall be considered as a temporary removal. The Annex I Party that makes use of such removal to achieve compliance with its Kyoto Protocol commitment shall continue to be responsible for the equivalent emission reduction at the appropriate point in time; i) In the methodologies to account for emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the land-use, land-use change and forestry sector, no consideration shall be given to the simple presence of stocks of carbon in national reservoirs, in line with the provisions of Article 5.2 of the Kyoto Protocol, Wishing to design a balanced, scientifically and environmentally-sound system of definitions and accounting, and to establish simple and practical rules and methodologies for the implementation of activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol, which can reduce uncertainty and can be implemented cost-effectively, taking into account the feasibility of designing such a system, Affirming the need to maintain incentives to reduce emissions from fossil fuel combustion and other sources, Acknowledging that all Parties must promote sustainable management of forests and other ecosystems, conserve biological diversity, and promote and cooperate in the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including biomass, forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems, Recognizing the importance of protecting and enhancing sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases in achieving the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments of the Parties included in Annex I, Aware of the estimated magnitude and uncertainties related to the residual terrestrial uptake, Mindful of the potential for sink reversal, Seeking to avoid double counting of emissions minus removals or carbon stock changes, Recalling the need for time-series consistency, Noting potential synergies between the implementation of Article 3.3 and 3.4 and action by Parties to meet the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Convention on Wetlands (RAMSAR Convention), and Agenda 21, Bearing in mind the different national circumstances of each Party regarding the protection and enhancement of sinks and reservoirs, Noting that policies and measures to deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost and should therefore be comprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and adaptation, and comprise all economic sectors, Noting the necessity to provide appropriate incentives for sustainable forest management through definitions of activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 as well as their associated accounting rules, Affirming that the inclusion of broad additional activities under Article 3.4 in the first commitment period must be consistent with the provisions of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol, Having considered decision -/CP.6 adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its sixth session, Adopts the text contained in the annex to this decision.] Annex A. Definitions Forest Option 1: Definition determined on country level Option la: One definition of a forest selected by each Party itself. 1. Parties shall elect one definition of a forest in accordance with their national circumstances. The definition must be used consistently in the first [and subsequent] commitment period[s]. [The formulation of the definition is irrevocable.] Option 1b: Forest definitions for each forest type or biome occurring within the Party’s boundaries. 2. Parties may choose to use several definitions of forest to account for different forest types in their country in accordance with their national circumstances. The definition(s) must be used consistently in the first [and subsequent] commitment period[s]. [The formulation of the definition(s) is irrevocable.] Option Ic: Use of the FAO definition as in the IPCC Special Report, with Party-specific thresholds for forest cover, tree height and minimum area. 3. For the purpose of applying Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol, the definition of a forest is: land with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than [Party to select a threshold of between 10 and 25] per cent and area of more than /Party to select a threshold of between 0.5 and 1] hectares (ha). The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of [ Party to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5] metres (m) at maturity in situ. [A forest] may consist either of closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground; or open forest formations with a continuous vegetation cover in which tree crown cover exceeds [Party to select a threshold between 10 and 25] per cent [, extending over an area of more than [Party to select a threshold between 0.5 and 1 ha]]. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes which have yet to reach a crown density of [Party to select a threshold between 10 and 25] per cent or tree height of [Party to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5 metres] m are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest. Option 2: Definitions and thresholds determined by COP Option 2a: FAO definition with universal thresholds for forest cover, tree height, and minimum area. 4. For the purpose of applying Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol, the definition of a forest is: land with tree crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than [COP to select a threshold of between 10 and 25 to be applied by all Parties] per cent and area of more than [COP to select a threshold of between 0.5 and 1 to be applied by all Parties| hectares (ha). The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of [COP to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5 to be applied by all Parties] metres (m) at maturity in situ. [A forest] may consist either of closed forest formations where trees of various storeys and undergrowth cover a high proportion of the ground; or open forest formations with a continuous vegetation cover in which tree crown cover exceeds [COP to select a threshold between 10 and 25 to be applied by all Parties] per cent [, extending over an area of more than [COP to select a threshold between 0.5 and 1 ha to be applied by all Parties]]. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes which have yet to reach a crown density of [COP to select a threshold between 10 and 25 per cent to be applied by all Parties] per cent or tree height of [COP to select a threshold between 0.25 and 5 metres to be applied by all Parties] m are included under forest, as are areas normally forming part of the forest area which are temporarily unstocked as a result of human intervention or natural causes but which are expected to revert to forest. Option 2b: Forest definition for each biome (international level) The COP/MOP requests the IPCC to develop definitions of a forest appropriate to each forest biome. Annex I Parties shall designate biomes to the lands within its boundaries and apply the associated forest definition as developed by the IPCC to each biome in order to determine eligible activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. Such designation shall be applied consistently during the first and subsequent commitment periods. The designation of biomes to the land is irrevocable, unless a change in vegetation or biome warrants a new designation. In cases where a Party alters the designation of biomes to the land, such changes shall be reported in accordance with Article 7 and reviewed in accordance with Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. Afforestation 5. “Afforestation” is the conversion of non-forest to forest on land that has not historically' been forested. Reforestation 6. “Reforestation” is the conversion of non-forest to forest on land that historically was forested, but that has been converted to non-forest. Re-establishment of the forest through planting, seeding and natural regeneration following harvesting will [not] be considered reforestation. Meaning of “historic” - Distinction between afforestation and reforestation 7. For purposes of defining afforestation and reforestation for the first commitment period, “historic” is considered to mean since 1 January 1990 [the last ... years]. Deforestation 8. “Deforestation” is the conversion of forest to non-forest, which is not immediately followed by the establishment of the same forest type on the same site. ' For the definition of “historic”, see paragraph 7. Is forest harvesting considered deforestation? 9. Reductions in forest cover as a result of harvesting or other practices which occur as part of ongoing forestry practice are not considered deforestation under Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol. 10. In cases where re-establishment of forest following harvesting takes place in the next commitment period, Parties shall provide information in accordance with Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol, to distinguish acts of harvesting from acts of deforestation. Such information will be reviewed in accordance with Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. Size of the assessment unit 11. For the purposes of determining the area of deforestation to come into the accounting system under Article 3.3, Parties shall determine canopy cover for each forested area within their borders for areas no greater than 10 ha [1 km?] [10 km?]. Revegetation 12. Revegetation is defined as human-induced activities that establish woody vegetation that covers a minimum area of 0.5 ha and does not meet the definitions of afforestation and reforestation in Article 3.3 and/or human-induced activities to increase carbon stocks on sites with minimum vegetation cover and low organic matter content. 13. Acts of revegetation include: Establishment of windbreaks and shelter belts; (a) Establishment of native vegetation; (b) Agroforestry planting of trees and the development of new tree crop products; (©) Changes in stock management and other practices to encourage regeneration; (d) Seeding or planting of legumes and grasses. (e) Forest management 14. Forest management is considered to include a combination of individual management activities related to multiple uses and services. Managed forests do not include parks, wilderness areas, wildlife preserves or other forests that are inaccessible. Carbon sequestration is one of the multiple functions of sustainable managed forests. Forest management activities are defined with the objectives to meet goals set by the forest owner. Cropland management 15. Cropland management includes practices on land on which agricultural field crops are grown and on land that is considered cropland but is not being used for crop production. Grazing land management 16. Grazing land management comprises practices aimed at manipulating the amount and type of forage and livestock produced. Grazing land includes lands on which the primary productive use is for livestock or other herbivore grazing. It can include lands such as natural pastures (native pastures), native hay, rangelands and drained peatlands. Grazing land management includes activities related to manipulating the amount and type of forage and livestock produced, such as forage species selection, fertilization, irrigation and drainage. B. Eligibility | Eligibility 17. For Atrticle 3.3, eligible activities are those that meet the requirements set forth in this decision and that have taken place on or since 1 January 1990 or in a year subsequent to 1990, but before the end of December of the last year of the commitment period. 18. Implementation of land-use, land-use change and forestry activities included under the provisions of Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol shall be consistent with the objectives and principles of the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention to Combat Desertification, the Ramsar Convention, the Rio Forest Principles, and Agenda 21. Inclusion of eligible activities under Article 3.4 in the second and subsequent commitment periods Option 1: Inclusion of all activities for second and subsequent commitment periods 19. All [human-induced] activities, and their associated changes in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, other than afforestation, reforestation and deforestation shall be counted under Article 3.4 in the second and subsequent commitment periods. Option 2: Approve a limited list of additional activities for second and subsequent commitment periods 20. The following human-induced activities, and their associated changes in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks, other than afforestation, reforestation and deforestation shall be counted under Article 3.4 in the second and subsequent commitment periods: [revegetation], [forest management], [cropland management], [grazing land management], [forest aggradation and degradation], [agroforestry], [establishment of urban greening], [control of forest fires and pest outbreaks]. Option 3: Establish a process to determine the inclusion of activities 21. A proposal was made to establish, prior to the fixing of quantified objectives for the second commitment period, a list of agreed additional activities for use in the second and subsequent commitment periods, together with the rules, modalities and guidelines for their accounting. Inclusion of eligible activities under Article 3.4 in the first commitment period Option 1: No additional activities unless scale, uncertainty, and risk issues resolved 22. No additional activities shall be pursued under the provisions of Article 3.4 during the first commitment period, unless the COP decides that the issues of scale, uncertainty and risk related to the sinks are resolved (see also paragraphs 34 to 35). Option 2a: Apply all approved activities 23. During the first commitment period, Parties may choose to account for net changes in GHG emissions from all additional Article 3.4 activities listed in paragraph __ above, for the second and subsequent commitment periods. Option 2b: Selected list to be applied by all Annex I Parties 24. During the first commitment period, the following activities shall be included by all Annex I Parties as additional human-induced activities under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol: (specify the activities. This should be a subset of the list of additional activities that may be applied in the second and subsequent commitment periods). Option 2¢c: Party chooses which activities it applies 25. Parties shall report in accordance with Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol, before the start of the first commitment period, which changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from additional activities it elects to add to, or subtract from, its assigned amount during the first commitment period. Such activities shall be limited to those, or a subset of those, listed in paragraphs 19 and 20 above. Such a decision is irrevocable. C. Accounting Accounting 26. Subject to paragraphs __ (insert those paragraph numbers determining the eligibility of activities), for the first commitment period, the adjustment to a Party’s assigned amount shall be equal to the net changes in CO, greenhouse gas emissions, measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks, and net changes in non-CO; emissions during the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 resulting from land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3 since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink, this value shall be added to the Party’s assigned amount. Where the result of this calculation is a net emission, this value shall be subtracted from the Party’s assigned amount. 27. If an area of land is subject to Article 3.3 activities as well as Article 3.4 activities, it shall be accounted for under Article 3.4. Initiation of accounting during the commitment period 28. Accounting of net changes in carbon stocks and non-CO, greenhouse gas emissions resulting from land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3 shall begin with [the onset of the activity or] the beginning of the commitment period [, whichever comes later]. Duration of accounting 29. Once land is accounted for under Article 3, all changes in GHG emissions and removals occurring from this land must be accounted for over subsequent and contiguous commitment periods. Carbon pools 30. Parties shall account for changes in carbon pools associated with land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, which shall include: above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon, and harvested wood products from deforestation activities, in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as required by Article 5.2, any future updates of (parts of) these Guidelines and, possible future good practice guidance to be developed by the IPCC on land-use, land-use change and forestry. 31. Parties shall account for all carbon pools that are a source of GHG emissions as a result of land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3, but may choose not to account for a given pool in a commitment period if transparent and verifiable information in provided that demonstrates that the pool in question is not a source. Non-CO; gases 32. Non-CO, emissions and/or removals, and verifiable changes in carbon stocks resulting from land-use, land-use change and forestry activities under Article 3 shall be estimated, reported, and accounted for in accordance with methodologies agreed to by the COP, and any additional methodologies that may be agreed to by the COP and the COP/MOP at future sessions as a result of methodological work on inventory guidelines, good practice guidance and uncertainty management. Separating out the natural uptake from human-induced effects on lands that are subject to land-use and forestry activities but that have not undergone a land-use change since 1990 Option 1: No separation 33. Changes in GHG emissions or removals as a result of direct human-induced activities, non-direct human-induced activities, and natural processes (extreme weather events, fire, pest invasion, El Nifio cycles, CO, and nitrogen fertilization) shall be accounted for together on each area of land where an eligible activity has taken place. Option 2: Separation 34. Only greenhouse gas removals from additional agreed land-use and forestry activities which can be shown to have a detectable direct human-induced effect on carbon stocks, shall be accounted for under the provisions of Article 3.4. This requirement shall be tested using verifiable statistical data to show that the hypothesis that the activity has no detectable human-induced effect, can be rejected with 10 per cent significance; 35. Accepted statistical tests and modeling techniques [to exclude carbon stock changes in all ecosystems caused by climate change, elevated carbon dioxide concentration and the effects of fertilization due to nitrogen fallout,] [to separate the direct human-induced effects from other effects,] shall be used singly or in combination to test the criterion referred to in paragraph 34. Such tests and techniques shall be based on data and information from: (a) Control plots used for comparison between land subject to the activity and land not subject to it; (b) Data from research plots; Data from research plots; Existing forest survey and planting data collected in the last 10 years. (©) 36. Deterministic model projections shall be used to factor out the dynamic effects of age structure in forest ecosystems. 37. Where such models, tests and techniques are not used, changes in carbon stocks associated with agreed activities shall only be applied if the rate of uptake exceeds 0.5 tonnes C/ha-yr for forest land and 0.1 tonnes C/ha-yr for grassland.’ 38. Crediting of carbon stock increases due to human activities shall not exceed the net increase in carbon on lands affected by the actions. Limiting debits and credits from Article 3.3 for all commitment periods 39. For the first commitment period, additions to a Party’s assigned amounts as a result of reforestation activities, will be limited to reforestation occurring on those lands that did not contain forest in 1990. 40. Debits resulting from harvesting in the first commitment period [and other natural and human-induced effects] following afforestation and reforestation since 1990, shall not be greater than credits earned from sequestration on that unit of land. Conditional “netting-out” of afforestation, reforestation and deforestation area g 41. A proposal was made that the area counted as deforestation during the first commitment period might be reduced by areas of afforestation and reforestation with the same or greater potential carbon content. > The natural uptake of cropland can be considered negligible. Limiting credits from Article 3.4 for the first commitment period Option 1: Limitation on credits using a ceiling 42. During the first commitment period, verifiable increases in carbon stocks associated with any agreed activities shall only be accountable under the provisions of Article 3.4 up to [X] per cent of the assigned amount. Option 2: Limitation on credits using a discount rate 43. During the first commitment period, only 5 [X] per cent of the verifiable increases in carbon stocks associated with agreed activities [all activities/specified activities/activity Y] shall be accountable under the provisions of Article 3.4. Option 3: Limitation on credits using a threshold 44. During the first commitment period, only verifiable increases in carbon stocks in excess of [a threshold level of X tonnes C/ha-yr] [0.5 tonnes C/ha-yr] associated with agreed activities [all activities/specified activities/activity Y] shall be accountable under the provisions of Article 3.4. Option 4: Limitation on credits using a country-specific threshold 45. During the first commitment period, a Party may add to its assigned amount only the positive net removals in excess of the threshold [specified for that Party] [formula based on country-specific data and information]. Option 5: Limiting credits to address uncertainty 46. Changes in carbon stocks under Article 3.4 shall be adjusted for uncertainty in a conservative way by debiting or crediting carbon stock changes at the lower bound of the absolute value of the 95 per cent confidence interval. Article 3.7 47. A single pre-commitment period review process should apply to all elements of a Party’s inventory, including all emissions and removals associated with land-use change and forestry. The eligibility of a Party to apply the final sentence of Article 3.7 shall be based on a complete, reviewed inventory. For calculating the initial assigned amount, all greenhouse gas emissions associated with land-use, land-use change and forestry, in CO; equivalents, shall be taken into account. 48. The meaning of the final sentence of Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol is that Parties for whom land-use change and forestry constituted a net source of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 shall include their aggregate anthropogenic emissions minus removals from land-use change in their greenhouse gas inventory for the base year and subsequent years. 49. Emissions from land-use change, for the purpose of the implementation of Article 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol, are those net emissions reported under the forest and grassland conversion and abandonment of managed lands subcategories of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines. 50. Since Parties to which the final sentence of Article 3.7 applies will already have counted the effects of activities related to land-use change agreed under the provisions of Article 3.3 and Article 3.4 as part of their base year and subsequent inventories, further accounting of these activities under the provisions of Article 3.3 and 3.4 would not apply to these Parties. D. Measuring and reporting 51. Areas of land under Article 3.3 and 3.4 shall be identifiable via guidelines on the national inventory system under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol. 52. Net changes in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions and removals shall be [in line with the requirements of Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol] [measured, estimated, monitored and reported, with associated uncertainties, in a manner consistent with the inventory guidelines adopted by the COP, or those to be adopted by the COP following methodological work by the IPCC and/or the COP, and any good practice guidance and uncertainty management adopted by the COP], [and the requirements for supplementary information agreed to by the COP/MOP under the provisions of Article 7.1 of the Kyoto Protocol.] 53. Depending on the choices made in paragraphs 1-4, one of the following options needs to be included. Parties shall provide information on [the source and suitability of their definitions] [the designation of biomes to the lands and the applied forest definitions] [the elected thresholds for forest cover, tree height, and minimum area] in accordance with Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol [prior to the first commitment period]. [The definitions] [This information] [The choice of thresholds] shall be reviewed in accordance with Article 8 of the Protocol.",09/26/2000,2000_425809,Germany,N/A,yes

Urges the Government of Myanmar to cease, without delay, all activities aimed at preventing the free exercise of internationally recognized human rights, including freedom of association, assembly, movement and speech, and in particular to remove all restrictions on the freedom of movement of Aung San Suu Kyi’s and other National League for Democracy members and on their freedom to communicate with the outside world; 7.

Notes with grave concern that the Government of Myanmar has failed to cease its widespread and systematic use of forced labour of its own people or to implement any of the three recommendations of the International Labour Organization on that issue; this failure has compelled the International Labour Organization strictly to limit further cooperation with the Government and has prompted the International Labour Conference to adopt, subject to certain conditions, a number of measures to secure compliance by the Government of Myanmar with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry established to examine the observance of the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29); 11.

Urges the Government of Myanmar to end the systematic enforced displacement of persons and other causes of refugee flows to neighbouring countries and to create conditions conducive to their voluntary return and their full reintegration in conditions of safety and dignity, and to allow the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel to assist in the return and reintegration process; 16.
