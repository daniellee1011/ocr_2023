of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Recalling with appreciation general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation, !’ while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption and the need to discuss the right to privacy in view of the challenges of the digital age, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, based on international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies, the impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, necessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices, Recognizing also that the discussion on the right to privacy should be based upon existing international and domestic legal obligations, including international human rights law, as well as relevant commitments, and should not open the path for undue interference with an individual’s human rights, Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information and democratic participation, Recognizing that the right to privacy is important for the enjoyment of other rights and can contribute to an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, and noting with concern that violations or abuses of the right to be free from unlawful or arbitrary interference with the right to privacy might affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of association, Noting that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, Expressing concern that individuals, particularly children, often do not and/or cannot provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the sale or multiple resale of their personal data, and that the collecting, processing, use, storage and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, have increased significantly in the digital age, Noting that general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee recommends that States take effective measures to prevent the unlawful retention, processing and use of personal data stored by public authorities and business enterprises, Noting also that the use of artificial intelligence can contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and has the potential to transform governments and "" Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-third Session, Supplement No. 40 (A/43/40), annex VI. 3/8 societies, economic sectors and the world of work and can also have various far- reaching implications, including with regard to the right to privacy, Noting with concern that artificial intelligence or machine-learning technologies, without proper technical, regulatory, legal and ethical safeguards, may lead to decisions that have the potential to affect the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, and affect non-discrimination, and recognizing the need to apply international human rights law and data protection frameworks in the design, evaluation and regulation of these practices, Recognizing that, while the use of artificial intelligence can have significant positive economic and social impacts, it requires and allows for the processing of large amounts of data, often relating to personal data, including biometric data and data on an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, race or ethnicity, religion or belief, which can pose serious risks to the enjoyment of the right to privacy, especially when done without proper safeguards, in particular when employed for identification, tracking, profiling, facial recognition, classification, behaviour prediction or scoring of individuals, Noting that the use of artificial intelligence may, without proper safeguards, pose the risk of reinforcing discrimination, including structural inequalities, and recognizing that racially and otherwise discriminatory outcomes should be prevented in the design, development, implementation and use of emerging digital technologies, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, hacking and the unlawful use of biometric technologies, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and the right to freedom of religion or belief and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Recognizing that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable with regard to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must take the necessary steps to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant, Expressing concern about the spread of disinformation and misinformation, particularly on social media platforms, which can be designed and implemented so as to mislead, to spread racism, xenophobia, negative stereotyping and stigmatization, to violate and abuse human rights, including the right to privacy, to impede freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, and to incite all forms of violence, hatred, intolerance, discrimination and hostility, and emphasizing the important contribution of journalists, civil society and academia in countering this trend, Emphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect personal data, when they share or otherwise provide access to data collected through, inter alia, information- and intelligence-sharing agreements 4/8 and when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including business enterprises, Noting the increase in the collection of sensitive biometric information from individuals, and stressing that States must comply with their human rights obligations and that business enterprises should respect the right to privacy and other human rights when collecting, processing, sharing and storing biometric information by, inter alia, considering the adoption of data protection policies and safeguards, Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption, pseudonymization and anonymity, are important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of opinion and expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and recognizing that States should refrain from employing unlawful or arbitrary surveillance techniques, which may include forms of hacking, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, journalists and other media workers may frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity, as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy, as a result of their activities, Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Noting also, in that respect, that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Stressing the need to address prevailing challenges to bridge the digital divides, both between and within countries, and the gender digital divide, and to harness information and communications technologies for development, and recalling the need to emphasize quality of access to bridge digital and knowledge divides, using a multidimensional approach that includes speed, stability, affordability, language, training, capacity-building, local content and accessibility for persons with disabilities, and to promote the full enjoyment of human rights, including the right to privacy, Stressing also the need to ensure that national security and public health measures, including the use of technology to monitor and contain the spread of infectious diseases, are in full compliance with the obligations of States under international human rights law and adhere to the principles of lawfulness, legality, legitimacy with regard to the aim pursued, necessity and proportionality and the need to protect human rights, including the right to privacy, and personal data in the response to health or other emergencies, Noting the importance of protecting and respecting the right of

'2 Resolution 68/3. 2/10 the persistent gaps in this regard, and identifies good practices and recommended actions in accessibility for the effective implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the disability-inclusive achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world’s population, or | billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by poverty, Welcoming progress towards mainstreaming disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in the work of the United Nations, and noting with appreciation the launch of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy and the leadership of the Secretary-General to bring about transformative and systematic change on disability inclusion across the United Nations system, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain, Concerned that women and girls with disabilities are often among the most vulnerable and marginalized in society and are at a greater risk of experiencing all forms of violence, and recognizing the need for national development strategies and efforts to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls with disabilities, the elimination of all forms of violence and the realization of their human rights, Recognizing that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately affected in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters and in their aftermath, and that they may require specific protection and safety measures, recognizing also the need to support further participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of such measures and decision-making processes relating thereto, in order to ensure disability-inclusive risk reduction and humanitarian action, and recognizing further the special coping mechanisms developed by persons with disabilities to withstand the effects of conflict and natural disasters, Recognizing also the contribution of families towards ensuring the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with others, and that persons with disabilities and their families should receive social protection and assistance to enable the family and its members to contribute towards the full and equal enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities and to ensure a safe and supportive family environment for persons with disabilities, Recognizing further the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality, non-discrimination and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and human rights and development, Concerned that access to health-care services remains a challenge for persons with disabilities, who are more than three times as likely as persons without disabilities to be unable to obtain health care when they need it, owing to, inter alia, a lack of financial resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, 3/10 Recognizing that persons with disabilities are directly and _ indirectly disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated existing inequalities, discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion and increased the risk of unemployment and poverty, as well as of violence and abuse, in particular against women and girls with disabilities, recognizing also that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as face barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may have higher rates of underlying risk factors, and have a greater risk of contracting COVID-19 disease, developing severe health conditions or being fatally affected by it, Reaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Taking note of the initiatives that the Secretary-General, United Nations agencies and United Nations entities have undertaken in order to promote disability inclusion in COVID-19 response and recovery efforts as a vital step towards achieving the pledge to leave no one behind, and noting in this regard the importance of promoting equal access of persons with disabilities to social services, quality education and health care, full and productive employment and decent work, encouraging their effective and meaningful participation, protecting their human rights, eliminating discrimination against them, and systematically collecting and using data disaggregated by sex, age and disability, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting inclusive development for all, Recognizing also that, while considerable progress has been made, the mainstreaming of disabilities, including the rights of persons with disabilities, remains a global challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities into development policies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this regard, the importance of mainstreaming the rights, participation, perspectives, needs and well- being of persons with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for sustainable development, and reaffirming the valued existing and potential contributions made by persons with disabilities to the overall well-being and diversity of their communities, Recognizing the rights of persons with disabilities with respect to full, meaningful and effective participation and inclusion in society, and therefore recognizing also that persons with disabilities should have the opportunity to be actively involved in all aspects of public, political, economic, cultural, social and family life, on an equal basis with all others, including in decision-making processes about policies and programmes, including national and international development 4/10 programmes, with a view to ensuring that such policies and programmes are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities, Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development plans, strategies and actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support, Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to quality education, full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major international sporting events, such as the international Paralympic Games, should be organized in the spirit of peace, mutual understanding, friendship and tolerance, where persons with disabilities have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,!* and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high- 3 Such as the Guidelines and

""' Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.96.1V.13), chap. I, resolution 1, annexes I and II. Resolution 70/1. 2/11 pandemic are projected to result in 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that otherwise would have been averted by 2030, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering of information on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Noting with concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls, but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Noting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of education are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic independence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women can expand their options for leaving abusive relationships, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls, Recognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and 3/11 confronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the importance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that respond to their specific needs, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict, public health emergencies and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Expressing deep concern about the unprecedented and multifaceted negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of, and efforts to end, child, 4/11 early and forced marriage, including the wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences and devastating impacts of the pandemic on the livelihoods of people and families, especially women and girls, and the poorest and most vulnerable, as well as the severe disruption to health and education systems, social protection programmes and the provision of protection and support services, including essential Services, Noting with deep concern that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, are likely to increase risks faced by girls, including already married girls, as well as women affected by this harmful practice, including risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, unintended and/or early pregnancy, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the associated risk of not returning to school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services, hindering the fulfilment of their rights and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations, Expressing deep concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates root causes of child, early and forced marriage, but also diverts international, regional and national attention and resources away from, inter alia, the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices, and furthermore that COVID-19 containment measures are delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, 1.

Urges Governments, while addressing child, early and forced marriage, to confront family poverty and social exclusion through investing in family-oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 12. Also urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, to tackle poverty, lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage, including by ensuring the rights of women and girls to inheritance and property, their equal access with men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, to encourage girls to continue their education, including through their re-enrolment in school after childbirth, to develop livelihood opportunities through access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills education, including financial literacy, and to promote freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as equal political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; 6/11 13. Encourages States to promote and protect the human rights of already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution and to address their specific needs, such as through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, increase their decision-making power, make it easier for them to seek formal employment, increase their economic independence and financial literacy, access education, skills development programmes and lifelong learning opportunities, ensure their equal access to health-care services and information and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 14. Calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school, including because of marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, which empowers young women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education that is relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 15.

A. 2/10 efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres in all regions of the world, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, and impairs their full enjoyment of, all human rights, Recognizing that women’s poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social and economic policies and from the benefits of education and sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women and girls impedes the social and economic and therefore the sustainable development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other internationally agreed development goals, Recognizing also that violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between men and women, seriously violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls and constitutes a major impediment to their full, equal and effective participation in society, as well as economic and political life, Recognizing further the special needs of women and girls living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism, and that global health threats, climate change, more frequent and intense natural disasters, conflicts, violent extremism as and when conducive to terrorism, and related humanitarian crises and the forced displacement of people threaten to reverse much of the development progress made in recent decades and have particular negative impacts on women and girls that need to be comprehensively assessed and addressed, Recognizing that the growing impact of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment, in digital contexts, especially on social media, its impunity and the lack of preventive measures and remedies underline the need for action by Member States, in partnership with relevant stakeholders, and that such violence may include stalking, death threats and threats of sexual and gender-based violence, as well as related trends against women and girls in digital contexts, such as trolling, cyberbullying and other forms of cyberharassment, including unwanted verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, with a view to discrediting women and girls and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, Alarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls, including gender- related killings of women and girls, also known as femicide in certain regions of the world, which constitutes an extreme form of violence against women and girls, is among the least punished crimes, and recognizing the key role of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including in ending impunity for such crimes, Gravely concerned that domestic violence, including intimate partner violence, remains the most prevalent and least visible form of violence against women of all social strata across the world, and emphasizing that such violence is a violation, abuse or impairment of the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms and, as such, is unacceptable, Stressing the need to fully engage men and boys as strategic partners and allies in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in preventing and eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and sexual harassment, Recognizing the critical contribution of family members in combating violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, and that in preventing such violence the family can play an important role, 3/10 Deeply concerned by the increased violence against women and girls around the world, including domestic violence, as well as harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child early and forced marriage, including in conflict-affected areas, particularly in the context of confinement measures and school closures adopted in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Taking note of the response plans, policies and initiatives implemented by Governments and civil society in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent violence against women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, and facilitate reporting thereon, and to ensure that all women and girls can lead lives free from violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination, including through the use of digital technologies, media, helplines or the mobilization of grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and other service providers to help victims to find safe spaces and seek support, Underscoring that, often, a lack of information and awareness, fear of reprisals, persisting impunity, all forms of discrimination, including structural discrimination, insufficient recourse for victims of violence against women and girls, gender stereotypes and negative social norms, including when leading to shame or stigma, as well as negative economic consequences, such as loss of livelihood or reduced income, prevent many women and girls, as applicable, from reporting or acting as witnesses and from seeking redress and justice for these crimes, Acknowledging the importance of combating trafficking in persons in order to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, and in this regard stressing the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, '° as well as of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, ""” Emphasizing that the lack or inadequacy of documentation, research and data on violence against women and girls, including disaggregated data, and on its prevalence, patterns and drivers, as well as on effective approaches to prevent and respond to it impedes efforts to design and implement measures, including, where appropriate, policies and legislation, to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Stressing that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote, protect and respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and hold to account the perpetrators of all forms of violence against women and girls, eliminate impunity and provide for effective access to appropriate remedies for victims and survivors, and should ensure the protection of women and girls, including adequate enforcement of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and the provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling, health-care and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, to promote an empowering environment, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women and girls subjected to violence, Encouraging the removal of all barriers to women’s access to justice and ensuring that they all have access to information about their rights as well as effective legal assistance so that they can make informed decisions regarding, inter alia, legal proceedings and issues relating to family law, and also ensuring that they have access to just and effective remedies for the harm that they have suffered, including formal and appropriate informal justice mechanisms, as provided for by national legislation and, where necessary, the adoption of national legislation, 16 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2237, No. 39574. 'T Resolution 64/293. 4/10 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors such as a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing sexual and gender-based violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, Recognizing the need to promote the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and women’s organizations, including victims and survivors of violence, in the development, implementation and evaluation of gender-responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of women and girls and their access to education and essential health services, the increased demand for paid and unpaid care work and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, are deepening already existing inequalities and risk reversing the progress in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls made in recent decades, 1. Strongly condemns all forms of violence against all women and girls, recognizing that they are an impediment to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and to the full realization of their human rights; 2. Stresses that “violence against women” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life, including online, and notes the economic and social harm caused by such violence; 3.

law, as well as all relevant treaties,! and the need to further promote and ensure respect thereof, Recalling the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949? and the Additional Protocols thereto of 8 June 1977,° and the obligation of parties to armed conflict to respect and ensure respect for international humanitarian law in all circumstances, and urging all such parties to comply with international humanitarian law and ensure respect for and protection of all humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel, Recalling also the specific obligations, under international humanitarian law, to respect and protect, in situations of armed conflict, medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, and hospitals and other medical facilities, which must not be unlawfully attacked, and to ensure that the wounded and sick receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention required, Deeply concerned by the continuous disregard, in many cases, for the principles and rules of international law, in particular international humanitarian law, Reaffirming the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence for the provision of humanitarian assistance, Recalling that primary responsibility under international law for the security and protection of humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel lies with the Government hosting a United Nations operation conducted under the Charter of the United Nations or its agreements with relevant organizations, Expressing its appreciation to those Governments which respect the internationally agreed principles on the protection of humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel, while expressing concern over the lack of respect for these principles in some areas, Noting the fact that the number of States parties to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel,* which entered into force on 15 January 1999, has reached 95, mindful of the need to promote the universality of the Convention, and welcoming the entry into force on 19 August 2010 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel,* which expands the scope of legal protection under the Convention, Expressing deep concern at the complex and dynamic security environment, marked by the diverse and multifaceted threats and significant security risks faced by humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel as they operate in increasingly high-risk environments, and the increase in the number of attacks directed against such personnel, including when they are on the roads, in public spaces, on United Nations premises and providing humanitarian assistance, ' These include, notably, the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 13 February 1946, the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies of 21 November 1947, the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel of 9 December

harassment, including sexual violence and other forms of violence against women, and equally concerned at the significant number of reported sexual assaults against both male and female United Nations personnel, Expressing deep concern also that the occurrence of attacks and threats against humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel is a factor that severely restricts the provision of assistance and protection to populations in need, and commending the commitment of United Nations and other humanitarian personnel to stay and deliver effectively the most critical programmes even in dangerous environments, Stressing the need to uphold the respect and protection which the flag of the United Nations, and the nature of humanitarian work, should command and ensure, and stressing the importance of fully respecting the obligations relating to the use of vehicles and premises of humanitarian personnel and United Nations and associated personnel as defined by relevant international instruments, as well as the obligations relating to distinctive emblems recognized in the Geneva Conventions, Noting that medical personnel, and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, in an armed conflict situation continue to be under a duty to provide competent medical service in full professional and moral independence, with compassion and respect for human dignity, and always to bear in mind human life and to act in the patient’s best interest, stressing the need to uphold their respective professional codes of ethics, and further noting the applicable rules of international humanitarian law relating to the non-punishment of any person for carrying out medical activities compatible with medical ethics, Commending the courage

medical and emergency facilities, Commending also the courage and commitment of those who take part in peace operations, including peacekeeping operations,’ often at great personal risk, especially national and locally recruited personnel, Noting with concern the evolving threats that United Nations personnel face when deployed and that, in 2019, 1,516 persons were affected by safety and security incidents, with 44 fatalities, of which 11 resulted from acts of violence, namely, crime and armed conflict, 192 injuries, of which 92 resulted from acts of violence, 6 abductions, 86 arrests
