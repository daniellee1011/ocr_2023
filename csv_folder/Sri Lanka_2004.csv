with religion, Bearing in mind the work of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on the issue of terrorism and in this context noting with concern that the reports of the

express request by the Sub-Commission, 1. Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, regardless of their motivation, in all their forms and manifestations, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed, as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening the territorial integrity and security of States, destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State; 2.

Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organizationâs principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1. Stresses that the proposal of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and, therefore, unacceptable; 11. 12. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office in Geneva; 12. 13. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 13. 14. Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 14. 15. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from non-represented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 15. 16. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 16. 17. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 17. 18. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 18. 19. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 19. 20. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 20. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 21. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of his mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 21. 22. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 22. Also requests the High Commissioner: 23. (a) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (b) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; () To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-first session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 24. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 25.

The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) representing the seven countries of South Asia, namely, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, was launched with the adoption of its Charter at the first-ever summit meeting of the South Asian Heads of State or Government in Dhaka in December 1985. 2. 3. The objectives of the Association as enunciated in its Charter are as follows: Â» To promote active collaboration and mutual assistance in the economic, social, cultural, technical and scientific fields Regional cooperation among the States members of the Association is governed by the following principles as contained in its Charter: 4. e Such cooperation is to complement and not substitute for bilateral or multilateral cooperation The highest authority of the Association rests with the SAARC Heads of State or Government who meet annually at the summit level. To date, 12 Summits have been held: Dhaka (1985), Bangalore (1986), Kathmandu (1987), Islamabad (1988), MalÃ© (1990), Colombo (1991), Dhaka (1993), New Delhi (1995), MalÃ© (1997), Colombo (1998), Kathmandu (2002) and Islamabad (2004). A/59/234 5. Comprising the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of SAARC member States, the Council of Ministers is responsible for formulating the policies of the Association; reviewing the progress of regional cooperation; deciding on new areas of cooperation; establishing additional mechanisms as deemed necessary; and deciding on other matters of general interest to the Association. The Council, which reports to the Heads of State or Government, is expected to meet twice a year and may also meet in extraordinary sessions by agreement among member States. It has held 24 regular sessions so far. Informal meetings of the Council are also held on the sidelines of the sessions of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 6. The Standing Committee consisting of the Foreign Secretaries of SAARC member States is entrusted with the task of overall monitoring and coordination of programmes; approving projects and programmes, and modalities of their financing; determining intersectoral priorities; mobilizing regional and external resources; and identifying new areas of cooperation. It meets as often as deemed necessary and reports to the Council of Ministers. It has to date held 29 regular sessions and 4 special sessions. The Standing Committee is assisted by the Programming Committee comprising senior officials of member States and has held 24 sessions to date. 7. At present, seven Technical Committees pursue regional cooperation in the identified areas. The areas covered by these Technical Committees include agriculture and rural development (including livestock and fisheries); health and population activities (including nutrition and drug-related issues); women, youth and children; environment and forestry; science and technology, and meteorology; human resources development (including education, skill development, arts, culture and sports); and transport (including land, water, railway and civil aviation). Besides, five Working Groups have been established in the agreed areas covering telecommunications, and information and communication technology; biotechnology; intellectual property rights (including traditional knowledge); tourism; and energy. 8. Poverty alleviation has been declared as the overarching goal of all SAARC activities. An Independent South Asian Commission on Poverty Alleviation reconstituted by the Eleventh SAARC Summit (2002) continues to play an advocacy role and is poised to prepare a comprehensive and realistic blueprint setting out SAARC development goals for the next five years in the areas of poverty alleviation, education, health and environment based on its report, entitled âOur future: our responsibilityâ, which it presented to the Twelfth SAARC Summit (2004). A Plan of Action on Poverty Alleviation approved by the Twelfth SAARC Summit (2004) is currently under implementation. 9. The Committee on Economic Cooperation comprising Commerce Secretaries of SAARC member States oversees regional cooperation in the economic sector. The Committee has so far held 11 meetings. Periodic meetings of SAARC Commerce Ministers formulate policy guidelines to promote cooperation in the field. Consultations among member States in this area have culminated in the signing of Agreements on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (1993) and the South Asian Free Trade Area (2004). A Committee of Experts is now working to fully realize the South Asian Free Trade Area, which is to come into force on 1 January 2006. A/59/234 10. The Eleventh SAARC Summit (2002) agreed to the vision of a phased and planned process eventually leading to a South Asian Economic Union (SAEU). The Twelfth SAARC Summit (2004) has since reiterated the Associationâs commitment to SAEU through creation of a suitable political and economic environment in the region. 11. Since the establishment of the Association, a number of ministerial-level meetings have been held to focus on specific areas of common concern to its member States. These meetings have now become an integral part of the Associationâs consultative structure. The subjects so far covered by these meetings include trade and commerce; international economic issues; children; womenâs issues; health; environment; disabled persons; youth; poverty alleviation; housing; agriculture; tourism; information; communications; and culture. 12. The States members of the Association have signed the following regional agreements and conventions: Agreement on Establishing the SAARC Food Security Reserve (1987); Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism (1987); Regional Convention on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1990); Agreement on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (1993); SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution (2002); SAARC Convention on Regional Arrangements for the Promotion of Child Welfare in South Asia (2002); Agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area (2004); Additional Protocol to the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism (2004); and SAARC Social Charter (2004). 13. The Association has to its credit five regional centres established in different SAARC capitals, namely, the SAARC Agricultural Information Centre (Dhaka); SAARC Tuberculosis Centre (Kathmandu); SAARC Meteorological Research Centre (Dhaka); SAARC Documentation Centre (New Delhi); SAARC Human Resource Development Centre (Islamabad). In addition to these, the Twelfth SAARC Summit (2004) has given the go-ahead for the establishment of three more regional centres in member States: SAARC Information Centre (Kathmandu); SAARC Coastal Zone Management Centre (MalÃ©); and SAARC Cultural Centre (Colombo). 14. A SAARC-Audio Visual Exchange (SAVE) Committee established under the auspices of the Association disseminates information about it and its member States through regular radio and television programmes. 15. The Association has instituted two awards, namely, the SAARC Youth Award and the SAARC Award, catering respectively to the youth and the nationals and institutions of its member States excelling in the fields of research and innovations, peace, development, poverty alleviation and other areas of regional cooperation. In addition, a SAARC Internship Programme is in place to enable South Asian scholars and researchers to undertake studies about the Association and its activities. 16. Besides the official-level cooperation among its member States, the Association promotes regional cooperation in the private sector as well. With this end in view, the Association grants recognition to civil society groups under two categories: Regional Apex Bodies and SAARC Recognized Bodies. The former category of professional bodies so far recognized by the Association includes the SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), SAARCLAW and South Asian Federation of Accountants, while the latter embodies regional associations A/59/234 like the SAARC Federation of University Women; Association of Management and Development Institutions; South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation of Architects; SAARC Cardiac Society; SAARC Association of Town Planners; Federation of State Insurance Organizations of SAARC Countries; SAARC Diploma Engineersâ Forum; Radiological Society of SAARC Countries; SAARC Teachersâ Federation; SAARC Surgical Care Society; Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature; and SAARC Association of Dermatologists, Venereologists and Leprologists. 17. The Associationâs Secretariat is based in Kathmandu and is headed by the Secretary-General, who is appointed by the Council of Ministers upon nomination by a member State on the basis of the principle of rotation in alphabetical order. 18. In accordance with the Charter objective, the Association promotes collaboration with other regional and international organizations, many of which belong to the United Nations system. The Association has so far entered into agreements/memorandums of understanding with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development; United Nations Childrenâs Fund; Asia Pacific Telecommunity; Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific; United Nations Development Programme; United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; European Commission; International Telecommunication Union; Canadian International Development Agency; World Health Organization; United Nations Development Fund for Women; and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. Following the directive of the Twelfth SAARC Summit (2004) to develop mutually beneficial links between SAARC and other regional and international organizations, bodies and States outside the region, the Association is all set to pursue collaborative activities and where applicable to sign partnership agreements/memorandums of understanding with organizations like the World Bank; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; United Nations Environment Programme; South Asia Cooperative Environment Programme; Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre; Association of Southeast Asian Nations; United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; Asian Development Bank; United Nations Industrial Development Organization; and United Nations Population Fund. 19. Since 1997, the Association has been holding interactive sessions at the ministerial level with the European Union and ASEAN on the sidelines of the sessions of the General Assembly in New York. The SAARC Foreign Ministers also meet informally during the General Assembly sessions. The Association is currently working on the possibility of convening an informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of SAARC and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries on the sidelines of the General Assembly session in September 2004, which is also expected to be a regular event in the years ahead. Besides, availing himself of the opportunity of his presence in New York during General Assembly sessions, the Secretary-General of SAARC meets senior officials of the United Nations and heads of United Nations agencies there. 20. As is evident from the above, SAARC has institutional arrangements for cooperation with a number of United Nations agencies. However, with the United Nations itself, no such arrangement is in place. In order to redress this lacuna experienced by the Association, the SAARC Council of Ministers, at its twenty- fourth session, preceding the Twelfth SAARC Summit in Islamabad in January 2004, authorized the Secretary-General to immediately initiate the necessary process A/59/234 of obtaining observer status with the United Nations, enabling the General Assembly, at its fifty-ninth session in September/October 2004, to take a decision on the matter. 21. SAARC is convinced that attaining observer status with the United Nations will enhance its profile as a regional association in the international community. Moreover, such status will not only act as an incentive to strengthen the existing collaboration between SAARC and United Nations agencies but will also qualify the former for an advantageous working relationship with the latter in the years ahead. Besides, such an arrangement is expected to facilitate the Associationâs own participation in and its interactions with other regional and international organizations during the sessions of the General Assembly in New York.
