Shobokshi Ambassador Permanent Representative 06-34844 (E) 240506 *0634844~* A/61/141 Annex I Explanatory memorandum 1. The OPEC Fund for International Development (“the Fund”) was established in 1976 by member countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in their collective desire to consolidate their financial assistance to other developing countries, in addition to the existing roles played through bilateral and multilateral channels of cooperation. The Fund therefore developed over the last 30 years as a multilateral agency for financial cooperation with the objective of providing assistance to developing countries in their economic and social development efforts. 2. The Fund has for over three decades been engaged in international development issues and has on numerous occasions worked with and supported the missions and activities of the United Nations and its various specialized agencies, programmes and funds on matters of interest to the General Assembly, including sustainable economic development of poor and low-income countries, poverty eradication and environmental development, on which more detailed information has been provided below. 3. The Fund also participated, by invitation, in several international conferences convened under the auspices of the United Nations and the specialized agencies. Recent examples of these include the 2000 Millennium Summit, the 2002 Barcelona AIDS Conference and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. In addition, the Fund will be participating later in the year in a similar conference to be held in Toronto. 4. The activities of the Fund are indeed of interest to the General Assembly, as the sphere of cooperation between the Fund and the United Nations has grown remarkably broader and more integrated. The Fund has consistently and increasingly worked with the United Nations and its subsidiary organs and the specialized agencies in promoting the values, goals and aspirations that are universally humanitarian, which the United Nations has come to symbolize. Specifically, the Fund has actively employed its resources, assets, personnel and influence to promote economic development, social integration, gender parity, access to health care and sanitary water systems and the study of international law, in the countries in which it operates. A summary of the activities of the Fund in this regard is provided below. 5. The participation of the Fund as an observer at the proceedings of the General Assembly would enhance further cooperation between the United Nations and the Fund and facilitate the work of the Fund as an intergovernmental international development organization.
