Strongly condemns all acts of sexual and gender-based violence and abuse, recognizes the need for a survivor-centred approach in preventing and responding to such violence and abuse, calls for immediate and non-discriminatory access to services, such as medical and psychosocial support, to be provided to all victims and survivors of such crimes and for every effort to be made to ensure justice for those who have suffered as a result of such crimes, including accountability and reparations, and urges all parties to the conflict to respect and protect the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and to heed the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry; 25.

played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities, including women and girls with disabilities of African and Asian descent, are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Condemning the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and recognizing the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as facing barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, Stressing that States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent health-care services, maternal health-care services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HI'V and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and health-care services can violate, abuse or impair the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Recognizing that information and communications technologies, including assistive technology and devices, have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can create conditions enabling the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and can contribute to their social and digital inclusion and digital literacy, empowerment and autonomy, and allow them to live independently on an equal basis with others and to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in society and in the world of work, while condemning all forms of violence against women and girls with disabilities in digital contexts, including new forms of violence such as cyberviolence, bullying and harassment, and their rising prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic, Recognizing also the major contribution made by civil society, including women’s and girls’ rights and community-based organizations, organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, older women, girls and youth, feminist groups, women and girl human rights defenders and disability inclusion advocates, and recognizing further the importance of having open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment and domestic violence, by, A/HRC/47/L.18/Rev.1 inter alia, providing for a supportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, including by raising awareness about the human rights of all women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing further that domestic violence is not a private family matter and must be eliminated, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, 1. Expresses outrage at the persistence and pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide; 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms all forms of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in the context of lockdown measures and school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 3. Expresses deep concern that all forms of discrimination and violence impair or nullify the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which hinders the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others in the economic, social, cultural, civil and political spheres, and is an impediment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 4. Stresses the need to strengthen efforts to empower women and girls with disabilities and enhance their participation and promote their leadership in society by taking measures to address all barriers that prevent or restrict their full and equal participation and inclusion in all spheres of life, including through the creation of enabling programmes, community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes, ensure their access, on an equal basis with others, to economic and financial resources and disability-inclusive and accessible social infrastructure, transportation, justice mechanisms and services, in particular in relation to health and education, as well as productive employment and decent work for women with disabilities, and ensure that the priorities and rights of women and girls with disabilities are fully incorporated into policies and programmes and that they are closely consulted and actively involved in decision-making processes; 5.

Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of

the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and the outcomes of their review conferences, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Recalling all relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the General Assembly and the Security Council and the relevant resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women, which, inter alia, affirmed that all forms of violence against women and girls must be prevented, condemned and eliminated and that women’s and girls’ access to justice and accountability for violations of their human rights must be ensured, GE.21-09200(E) A/HRC/47/L.18 Recalling also the commitment to eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 5, in particular targets 5.2 and 5.3, and the commitment to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels, contained in Sustainable Development Goal 16, and taking into account the commitment to leave no one behind, Acknowledging the important role played by regional conventions, instruments, declarations and initiatives in preventing, responding to and eliminating violence against women and girls, Welcoming the work and taking note with appreciation of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Expressing deep concern at the continued prevalence of violence against women and girls in all their diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and re-emphasizing that violence against women and girls violates, abuses and impairs their human rights and, as such, is completely unacceptable, Stressing that “violence against women and girls” means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological, social or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres, including in digital contexts and in the world of work, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon and a manifestation of historical and structural gender inequality and discrimination against women and girls, rooted in unequal power relations between women and men and in gender stereotypes, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, forced sterilization, forced abortion and forced contraception, and conflict-related sexual violence and violence motivated by xenophobia, nullify the exercise and full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all women and girls, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and to violence, in the public and private spheres, including in the home, in families, in communities, in the world of work, in schools, in digital contexts and in institutions, and stressing the urgent need to address all forms of violence and discrimination against them, Deeply concerned also that women and girls with disabilities face an increased risk of violence based on stereotypes that dehumanize, infantilize, objectify, exclude or isolate them, Recognizing that older women experience disability more frequently as they age and that ageism contributes to the increased risk of violence faced by older women with disabilities, including physical violence, psychological, verbal and financial abuse and social isolation and exclusion, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities belonging to minorities are subject to multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence because of, inter alia, their race or ethnicity, gender and disability status combined, Recognizing further the particularly high levels of violence faced by indigenous women and girls with disabilities, especially those living in rural and remote communities and those who are migrants, and the need to ensure their access to justice and support services on an equal basis with others, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels and to engage with all stakeholders, including persons with disabilities and organizations of and led by them, as well as men and boys alongside women and girls as agents of change, to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres, online and offline, including the need to address gender inequality, ableism and A/HRC/47/L.18 ageism and the stigma, socioeconomic inequality and negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that underlie and perpetuate such violence, Recognizing that poverty, discrimination and marginalization resulting from exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of lifelong education, health, international labour standards and social protection, sustainable development and humanitarian assistance can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of violence, Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected by homelessness, which can be driven by, inter alia, separation, abandonment, domestic violence, elder abuse and child abuse, and that homelessness can place women and girls with disabilities at increased risk of institutionalization and violence in that context, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities face barriers in reporting violence, including a lack of accessible information about the justice system and of procedural accommodation to ensure effective access to justice and remedies for women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, Deeply concerned about the negative impact of laws and practices that impede persons with disabilities or fail to provide them with adequate support in the exercise of their legal capacity on an equal basis with others, which has a negative impact on the enjoyment of equality and non-discrimination, and in some cases that deny them their right to effective access to justice on an equal basis with others or allow for their forced institutionalization on the basis of a real or perceived disability, Expressing concern that forced institutionalization is a form of violence that deprives women and girls of liberty on the basis of disability and that in such situations they face an increased risk of further violations and abuses, including physical, psychological and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing that women and girls with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities, in particular those using mental health services or living in institutional settings, face an increased risk of violence, abuse and deprivation of liberty on the basis of disability owing to discrimination, stereotyping and stigma associated with disability, and underscoring the need to take all appropriate measures to ensure timely access to age- and gender-responsive and survivor-centred mental health, psychosocial support and community services, Recognizing also that women and girls with disabilities, in particular older women, are disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities and systemic discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion, disrupted social protection services and assistance, increased reliance on caregivers, limited access to adequate housing, education, justice and essential health services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and increased the risk of isolation, unemployment, poverty and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic violence and intimate partner violence, and violence in digital contexts and violence, abuse and neglect perpetrated in institutional settings, and recognizing further that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as facing barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines, medical equipment, employment, education, public health information and health-care services, Deeply concerned about the particular risk of segregation, exclusion, abuse and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence against persons with disabilities of all ages, especially in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence of natural disasters, Stressing that States shall take, in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, Recognizing the adverse impacts of climate change on women and girls with disabilities, including increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from reduced access A/HRC/47/L.18 to emergency support and violence prevention and response services, and emphasizing the need for States to ensure the participation of women and girls with disabilities in disaster preparedness and response planning, Deeply concerned that silence and stigma surrounding disability and menstruation mean that women and girls with disabilities often lack basic information and are excluded and stigmatized, a situation exacerbated by the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, Reaffirming sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, Deeply concerned that women and girls with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to forced sterilization, which is a form of violence and violation and abuse of human rights that may constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and results in lifelong consequences for the physical and mental integrity of women and girls with disabilities, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health information and services include, inter alia, accessible and inclusive family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, adolescent-friendly health services, maternal health care and services, such as skilled birth assistance and emergency obstetric care, including midwives for maternity services, perinatal care, safe abortion when not against national law, post-abortion care, and prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, Concerned that denying access to sexual and reproductive health information and services can violate, abuse or impair the right to attain the highest standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and may constitute a form of violence against women and girls that can lead to maternal morbidity and mortality, Underlining the need to promote the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including victims and survivors of all forms of violence, in decision-making processes and leadership roles and in the conceptualization, development and implementation of intersectional age- and gender- responsive policies, regulations and legislation designed to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, Recognizing that information and communications technologies, including assistive technology and devices, have shown their potential to strengthen the exercise of human rights, and that they can create conditions enabling the full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of their human rights and can contribute to their social and digital inclusion and digital literacy, empowerment and autonomy, and allow them to live independently on an equal basis with others and to fully, effectively and meaningfully participate in society and in the world of work, while condemning all forms of violence against women and girls with disabilities in digital contexts, including new forms of violence such as cyberviolence, bullying and harassment, and their rising prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic, Recognizing also the major contribution made by civil society, including women’s and girls’ rights and community-based organizations, organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, older women, girls and youth, feminist groups, women and girl human rights defenders and disability inclusion advocates, and recognizing further the importance of having open, accessible, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the development and implementation of measures promoting gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and of allowing civil society to operate freely and safely without fear of intimidation or reprisals, Recognizing further the critical responsibility of families in eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual harassment and domestic violence, by, inter alia, providing for a supportive environment for the empowerment of all women and girls, including by raising awareness about the human rights of women and girls in all their A/HRC/47/L.18 diversity, including women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing further that domestic violence is not a private family matter and must be eliminated, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics, and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, 1. Expresses outrage at the persistence and pervasiveness of all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide; 2. Condemns in the strongest possible terms all forms of violence against women and girls, including women and girls with disabilities, and in the context of lockdown measures and school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; 3. Expresses deep concern that all forms of discrimination and violence impair or nullify the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, which hinders the full, effective and meaningful participation and inclusion of women and girls with disabilities on an equal basis with others in the economic, social, cultural, civil and political spheres, and is an impediment to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls; 4. Stresses the need to strengthen efforts to empower women and girls with disabilities and enhance their participation and promote their leadership in society by taking measures to address all barriers that prevent or restrict their full and equal participation and inclusion in all spheres of life, including through the creation of enabling programmes, community outreach, mentoring and capacity-building programmes, ensure their access, on an equal basis with others, to economic and financial resources and disability-inclusive and accessible social infrastructure, transportation, justice mechanisms and services, in particular in relation to health and education, as well as productive employment and decent work for women with disabilities, and ensure that the priorities and rights of women and girls with disabilities are fully incorporated into policies and programmes and that they are closely consulted and actively involved in decision-making processes; 5. Also stresses the need to address multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, which place women and girls at greater risk of exploitation, violence and abuse, and to implement measures to prevent and eliminate stereotypes based on disability, gender, age, race and xenophobia, ableism, stigma, negative social norms, attitudes and behaviours that cause or perpetuate discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Recognizes that a proactive multisectoral approach, working with all relevant stakeholders, including organizations of and led by persons with disabilities, is required to prevent, respond to and eliminate violence against women and girls with disabilities, including lifelong education, training and media campaigns that promote respect, dignity, accountability, equality, non-discrimination, inclusion and accessibility, as well as full and effective participation in political and public life and economic empowerment, social protection measures aimed at reducing poverty and financial dependence on other persons and measures aimed at deinstitutionalization and promotion of independent living; 7. Calls upon States to take immediate and effective action to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls by: (a) Fostering respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, promoting empowering portrayals of women and girls with disabilities and awareness-raising campaigns of their capabilities and contributions, and refraining from supporting or funding campaigns that perpetuate stigmatization or stereotyping of women and girls with disabilities;

(COVID-19) pandemic on the right to education for all, taking into account that more than 1.5 billion learners have been affected by the closure of educational institutions worldwide, Expressing

of the right to education, Stressing in this respect that the incorporation of digital technologies in education, notwithstanding its potential to expand and complement access to education, is not a long- term replacement for on-site schooling, and the need for a thorough debate on the role of digital technologies in education, keeping in mind not only equality of opportunities, including for

Fund and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, within their Please recycle @ GE.21-09295(E) A/HRC/47/L.23 respective mandates, to prevent maternal mortality and to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, Recognizing that maternal morbidity, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has a negative impact on the woman’s or girl’s well-being, Recognizing also that preventable maternal morbidity is a human rights concern and that preventable deaths and grievous injuries sustained by women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth are not inevitable events, but rather a direct result of discriminatory laws and practices, harmful gender norms and practices, a lack of functioning health systems and services and a lack of accountability, Stressing the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of, inadequate or inaccessible health-care services, early childbearing, child, early and forced marriage, violence against women and girls, sociocultural barriers, marginalization, illiteracy and gender inequality as root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, equality, accountability, engagement, participation, accessibility, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, non-discrimination and international cooperation, Recognizing also that the underlying determinants of health, such as equitable access to affordable and safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, as well as quality and essential health-care services, are essential to ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing further that violations of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Recognizing also that the right to seek, receive and impart information concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights issues is essential for the accessibility of services, and that unequal access to information by women and girls, including indigenous women and girls, those from ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and those from other marginalized groups, amounts to discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and A/HRC/47/L.23 morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls, including adolescents, throughout the world, Deeply concerned also that women and girls living in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian and conflict settings, are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of human rights violations and abuses, including through sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and lack of affordable, accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment and all types of malnutrition, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overloaded health systems, the reallocation of human and financial resources, including the redeployment of midwives, shortages of medical personnel and supplies, and disruptions to global supply chains, which could undermine the sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights of women and girls, and has affected the availability of and access to health-care workers, access to maternal and newborn care and other essential maternal and child health support and services; safe abortion, when not against national law, and post- abortion care; sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights information and education; contraception; and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, while fear of contracting the virus may inhibit women and girls from visiting health-care facilities, thereby increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned that widespread discrimination against women and girls, including on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, racial or ethnic background, language, religion, health, indigenous or other status, and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination substantially heighten their risk of suffering maternal morbidities, and that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic discrimination faced by women and girls and increased the occurrence of sexual and gender- based violence and harassment, child, early and forced marriage and unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents, thereby also increasing the risk of maternal morbidity, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that the stigma, shame and isolation associated with specific forms of maternal morbidities can lead to harassment, discrimination, ostracism and violence against women and girls and can prevent them from seeking care, thereby resulting in physical, psychological, economic and social harm to or suffering for women and girls, Recognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates not only between but also within countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas and among women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and severe morbidity among adolescent girls in developing countries, and recognizing the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, A/HRC/47/L.23 Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, to the full enjoyment of their human rights, to their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, Deeply concerned that maternal morbidity reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates the full enjoyment of their rights, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, best practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy, and to guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence- based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion, when not against national law, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2. Urges States to ensure the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care services, including mental health and psychosocial services and sexual and reproductive health-care services, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; 3. Calls upon States, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure continuity of sexual and reproductive health-care services, including access to maternal and newborn care, and other essential maternal and child health support and services, safe abortion, when not against national law, modern forms of contraception, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, prevention of vertical transmission of HIV, nutrition and mental health services; 4. Also calls upon States to address the underlying determinants of health, such as gender discrimination and socioeconomic factors, including poverty and malnutrition, which render certain women and girls, including adolescents, more vulnerable to maternal morbidities, such as obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others; 5. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a human rights-based approach, to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of available, accessible, acceptable and quality health- care services for all, and of information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, poverty, stigma and lack of confidentiality of medical patient records, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, shortages in human and material resources facing health-care systems, shortages in humanitarian assistance and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and discrimination, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Calls upon States to promote human rights-based and gender responsive multisectoral and cross-disciplinary coordination of policies, programmes, budgets and services designed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities with the active participation of all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, and especially the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls at the national, local and community levels, and to promote social accountability mechanisms to monitor these policies, programmes, budgets and A/HRC/47/L.23 services in order to accelerate the elimination of maternal mortality and morbidity and the achievement of universal access to sexual and reproductive health; 7. Urges States to strengthen the capacity and resourcing of health-care systems and the health workforce, to provide the essential services needed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, such as through increased budget allocations for health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and the deployment and training of midwives, nurses, obstetricians, gynaecologists, doctors, surgeons and anaesthesiologists, in accordance with international medical standards and to ensure holistic social integration services, including counselling, education, family planning, socioeconomic empowerment, social protection and psychosocial services, so that women and girls living with maternal morbidity can overcome stigma, discrimination, ostracism and economic and social exclusion; 8. Also urges States to strengthen their research, data collection and monitoring and evaluation systems to promote reliable, transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls, in order to support more comprehensive policies to prevent and address maternal morbidities; 9. Calls upon States to increase awareness and the visibility of maternal morbidity as a human rights concern, including through more targeted research in this area, allocation of sufficient resources and dedicated efforts to ensure the availability, particularly for women and girls, of information on the causes of specific maternal morbidities and their prevention; 10. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,! which focuses on maternal morbidity as a human rights issue, and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 11. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, such as by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 12. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect bodily autonomy and privacy rights and the equal right to decide autonomously in matters regarding one’s own life and health by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights law and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviour that are discriminatory; 13. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws and standards aimed at preventing violations of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, such as by informing women and girls of their rights under relevant normative frameworks and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 14.

reinforcing, Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and recalling relevant international instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International

Commission on Population and Development, Recalling the commitment contained in Sustainable Development Goal 3 to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030, OER10) Please recycle@ E ) GE.21-09443(E) A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 Welcoming the efforts of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and other United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, within their respective mandates, to prevent maternal mortality and to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and their review conferences and outcome documents, in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, Recognizing that maternal morbidity, as defined by the World Health Organization, refers to any health condition attributed to and/or aggravated by pregnancy and childbirth that has a negative impact on the woman’s or girl’s well-being, Recognizing also that preventable maternal morbidity is a human rights concern and that preventable deaths and grievous injuries sustained by women and girls during pregnancy and childbirth are not inevitable events, but rather a direct result of discriminatory laws and practices, harmful gender norms and practices, a lack of functioning health systems and services and a lack of accountability, Stressing the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of, inadequate or inaccessible health-care services, early childbearing, child, early and forced marriage, violence against women and girls, sociocultural barriers, marginalization, illiteracy and gender inequality as root causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, equality, accountability, engagement, participation, accessibility, transparency, empowerment, sustainability, non-discrimination and international cooperation, Recognizing also that the underlying determinants of health, such as equitable access to affordable and safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, as well as quality and essential health-care services, are essential to ensure the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, Recognizing further that violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and those involving inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post- partum depression and infertility, among others, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Recognizing also that the right to seek, receive and impart information concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights issues is essential for the accessibility of services, and that unequal access to information by women and girls, including indigenous A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 women and girls, those from ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and those from other marginalized groups, amounts to discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls, including adolescents, throughout the world, Deeply concerned also that women and girls living in vulnerable situations, including in humanitarian and conflict settings, are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of human rights violations and abuses, including through sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and lack of affordable, accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment and all types of malnutrition, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned further that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to overloaded health systems, the reallocation of human and financial resources, including the redeployment of midwives, shortages of medical personnel and supplies, and disruptions to global supply chains, which could undermine the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls, and has affected the availability of and access to health-care workers, access to maternal and newborn care and other essential maternal and child health support and services; safe abortion when not against national law, and post- abortion care; sexual and reproductive health information and education; contraception; and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, while fear of contracting the virus may inhibit women and girls from visiting health-care facilities, thereby increasing the risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, Deeply concerned that widespread discrimination against women and girls, including on the basis of age, socioeconomic status, disability, racial or ethnic background, language, religion, health, indigenous or other status, and multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination substantially heighten their risk of suffering maternal morbidities, and that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic discrimination faced by women and girls and increased the occurrence of sexual and gender- based violence and harassment, child, early and forced marriage and unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents, thereby also increasing the risk of maternal morbidity, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that the stigma, shame and isolation associated with specific forms of maternal morbidities can lead to harassment, discrimination, ostracism and violence against women and girls and can prevent them from seeking care, thereby resulting in physical, psychological, economic and social harm to or suffering for women and girls, Recognizing also that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates not only between but also within countries, particularly in rural and remote areas and the poorest urban areas and among women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and severe morbidity among adolescent girls in A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 developing countries, and recognizing the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, to the full enjoyment of their human rights, to their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, Deeply concerned that maternal morbidity reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and that of their children, and violates the full enjoyment of their rights, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, and their review conferences and outcome documents, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, best practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy, and to guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health- care services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion when not against national law, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2. Urges States to ensure the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care services, including mental health and psychosocial services and sexual and reproductive health-care services, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; 3. Calls upon States, also in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure continuity of sexual and reproductive health-care services, including access to maternal and newborn care, and other essential maternal and child health support and services, safe abortion when not against national law, modern forms of contraception, screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, screening and treatment for cervical cancer, prevention of vertical transmission of HIV, nutrition and mental health services; 4. Also calls upon States to address the underlying determinants of health, such as gender discrimination and socioeconomic factors, including poverty and malnutrition, which render certain women and girls, including adolescents, more vulnerable to maternal morbidities, such as obstetric fistula, uterine prolapse, post-partum depression and infertility, among others; 5. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a human rights-based approach, to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of available, accessible, acceptable and quality health- care services for all, and of information and education, including evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, poverty, stigma and lack of confidentiality of medical patient records, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, shortages in human and material resources facing health-care systems, shortages in humanitarian assistance and funding shortages affecting A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and discrimination, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls; 6. Calls upon States to promote human rights-based and gender responsive multisectoral and cross-disciplinary coordination of policies, programmes, budgets and services designed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities with the active participation of all relevant stakeholders, including civil society, and especially the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls at the national, local and community levels, and to promote social accountability mechanisms to monitor these policies, programmes, budgets and services in order to accelerate the elimination of maternal mortality and morbidity and the achievement of universal access to sexual and reproductive health; 7. Urges States to strengthen the capacity and resourcing of health-care systems and the health workforce, to provide the essential services needed to prevent and treat maternal morbidities, including through increased budget allocations for health, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and the deployment and training of midwives, nurses, obstetricians, gynaecologists, doctors, surgeons and anaesthesiologists, in accordance with international medical standards and to ensure holistic social integration services, including counselling, education, family planning, socioeconomic empowerment, social protection and psychosocial services, so that women and girls living with maternal morbidity can overcome stigma, discrimination, ostracism and economic and social exclusion; 8. Also urges States to strengthen their research, data collection and monitoring and evaluation systems to promote reliable, transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls, in order to support more comprehensive policies to prevent and address maternal morbidities; 9. Calls upon States to increase awareness and the visibility of maternal morbidity as a human rights concern, including through more targeted research in this area, allocation of sufficient resources and dedicated efforts to ensure the availability, particularly for women and girls, of information on the causes of specific maternal morbidities and their prevention; 10. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,! which focuses on maternal morbidity as a human rights issue, and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 11. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, including by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 12. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect bodily autonomy and privacy rights and the equal right to decide autonomously in matters regarding one’s own life and health by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights law and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviour that are discriminatory; ' A/HRC/45/19. A/HRC/47/L.23/Rev.1 13. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws and standards aimed at preventing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, especially those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, such as by informing women and girls of their rights under relevant normative frameworks and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 14. Calls upon States to ensure gender equality, women’s rights and children’s rights through inclusive public awareness-raising and evidence-based initiatives, including in schools, through the media and online, and by incorporating curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender- based violence and discrimination, and ensuring universal access to evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, in and out of school settings; 15.

Notes with deep concern the Commission of Inquiry’s recent comments that widespread enforced disappearance has been deliberately perpetrated by Syrian security forces throughout the past decade on a massive scale, to spread fear, stifle dissent and as punishment, and that tens of thousands of men, women, boys and girls, who were taken into the custody of the Syrian authorities, remain forcibly disappeared 10 years after the first waves of mass arrests, and notes in this regard the link between detention and enforced disappearance in the Syrian Arab Republic; 11. Strongly condemns all human rights violations and abuses in detention, including summary executions, torture and ill-treatment, including through sexual and A/HRC/47/L.6 gender-based violence, and the fact that according to the Commission of Inquiry’s estimates tens of thousands of individuals have been killed in the custody of the Syrian regime, and urges all parties to immediately cease such human rights violations and abuses; 12. Deeply regrets that the fate of tens of thousands of the victims subjected to arbitrary and incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance by the regime, and in lower numbers by Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and other armed groups, remains largely unknown; 13. Recalls that the Commission of Inquiry found reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian authorities has continued to carry out a widespread or systematic attack directed against the civilian population, in pursuance of a firmly established policy to commit such acts, comprising crimes against humanity, including enforced disappearance, and that members of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant have perpetrated crimes against humanity, including acts of enforced disappearance; 14. Highlights that evidence suggests that the Syrian authorities maintain a detailed bureaucracy and a high degree of centralized control with regard to those whom they have detained, including records on who is detained and where, and notes the potential value of such information to family members of those who are missing, including those forcibly disappeared; 15. Expresses deep concern that, according to the recent findings of the Commission of Inquiry, the Syrian authority forces continue to deliberately conceal the fate and whereabouts of those forcibly disappeared, intentionally prolonging the suffering of hundreds of thousands of family members; 16. Also expresses deep concern that, while not on the same scale as the Syrian regime, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham and other armed groups’ refusal to reveal the fate or whereabouts of persons taken into their custody was found by the Commission to constitute acts tantamount to enforced disappearance; 17. Expresses particular concern about the impact of enforced disappearance on children, not only as direct victims and as family members of disappeared persons, but also as a result of their increased vulnerability and risk of exploitation created by the disappearance of a parent; 18. Also expresses particular concern about the gendered impact of enforced disappearance where widespread and systematic arrests of men and boys by primarily Syrian regime forces has resulted in an additional burden for an increasing number of female-headed households, and the fact of many men and boys being missing and/or their subsequent undocumented deaths compounds the trauma and creates legal barriers for women and children in terms of access to inheritance, issues of child custody, freedom of movement and birth registration, and stresses the importance of addressing these issues; 19. Highlights the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry regarding accountability and support for victims, survivors and their families, including psychosocial support and the identification of those missing and disappeared, and in the case of deaths of detainees, the issuance of the necessary documentation and allowing families to retrieve the bodies of their relatives or be informed of their whereabouts, and notes in this regard the importance of avoiding tampering with or contaminating mass grave sites in the Syrian Arab Republic; 20. Recalls that applicable obligations under international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including with regard to the fate and whereabouts of missing persons, exist independently of a political agreement; 21. Emphasizes the need for accountability, including for crimes committed in relation to enforced disappearance in the Syrian Arab Republic, and underscores that accountability is vital in peace negotiations and peacebuilding processes; 22. Also emphasizes the vital work of Syrian organizations of victims, survivors and families working on the issue of missing persons, including those subjected to enforced disappearance, supports their efforts to compile a comprehensive, transparent record of all casualties of the conflict and acknowledges the importance of their work regarding urgent A/HRC/47/L.6 access to information about those missing and disappeared and the need for accountability and justice for the victims and their families; 23. Encourages all Member States, relevant United Nations bodies, international organizations and civil society to coordinate further efforts and proactively focus attention on the issue of missing persons in the Syrian Arab Republic, including those subjected to enforced disappearance, and recalls the importance of the full and meaningful participation of victims, survivors and their families in such efforts; 24.

General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which the Assembly addressed the need to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in order to ensure that no one is left behind, and stated that the systematic mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is crucial, Recognizing that the full realization of the right to education for all is an essential condition for achieving sustainable development, and in this regard encouraging States to GE.21-09153(E) A/HRC/47/L.3 effectively implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Sustainable Development Goal 4 on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all, underlining the commitment therein to eliminate gender disparities in education, and Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, Recalling the need to ensure that all children enjoy the right to education and are ensured equal access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education, the need to eliminate gender disparities in education by 2030, and the need to build and upgrade education facilities that are child- focused, disability- and gender-sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, inclusive, accessible and effective learning environments for all, Recalling also the Incheon Declaration: Education 2030 — towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all, adopted at the World Education Forum 2015, held in Incheon, Republic of Korea, from 19 to 22 May 2015, Noting with appreciation the work carried out by all relevant organs, bodies and mechanisms of the United Nations system within their respective mandates, in particular the United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the United Nations Population Fund and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the efforts of organizations and civil society to promote all girls’ full and equal enjoyment of the right to education, Recognizing that the right to education is a multiplier right that supports the empowerment of all women and girls to claim their human rights, including the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs, as well as in economic, social and cultural life, and to fully, equally and meaningfully participate in the decision-making processes that shape society, and the transformative potential of education for every girl, Reaffirming the equal right of every child to education without discrimination of any kind, and concerned by the continuation of the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination faced by girls, Recognizing that gender stereotypes about the role of women and girls underpin many of the barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of access to at least 12 years of quality education, and that stereotypes are also perpetuated in school curricula and materials, Deeply concerned by the wide-ranging, negative impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the equal right of every child to education and on the realization of the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl, as an estimated 11 million girls are at risk of not returning to school, Deeply concerned also by the mass school closures and the estimated 58 million children who were not enrolled in primary school prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which approximately 54 per cent were girls, Deeply concerned further that the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and economic situation of all women and girls and their access to education, and the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence, and violence and sexual harassment in digital contexts, during lockdowns, are deepening already existing inequalities and risks, reversing the progress made in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in recent decades, Recognizing that, despite gains in providing access to quality education, rural girls are still more likely than rural boys to remain excluded from education and that among the gender-specific barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of their right to education are the feminization of poverty, child labour undertaken by girls, child, early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation, early and repeat pregnancies, all forms of violence, including gender-based violence, abuse and harassment on the way to, from and at school and in the technology-mediated environment, the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work performed by girls, and gender stereotypes and negative social norms that lead families A/HRC/47/L.3 and communities to place less value on the education of girls than that of boys and may influence the decision of parents to allow girls to attend school, Noting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its worst forms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and affected by armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without nationality or birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child labour and that many children face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with unpaid care and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood and hamper the full enjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent employment in the future, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meets the needs of girls, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and education thereon and are excluded and stigmatized, and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, including in accessing at least 12 years of quality education, Deeply concerned also that humanitarian crises and armed conflicts are depriving children, especially girls and girls with disabilities, of access to education, and that this has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in girls being two and a half times more likely than boys to be out of school in these settings, Deploring attacks on and abductions of girls because they attend or wish to attend school, as well as all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions as such, their students and staff, and during girls’ journeys to school, and strongly recognizing the negative impact that such attacks have on the progressive realization of the right to education, in particular of girls, and the obligations of States to provide an enabling and secure environment to ensure the safety of schools, Noting that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected persons in vulnerable situations and that marginalized girls are at a high risk of not returning to school, Stressing the crucial importance of the contribution of parliamentarians, national human rights institutions and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, women’s rights organizations, faith actors and institutions and youth organizations, to ensuring the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl, Determined to give full effect to the right to education and to guarantee that this right is recognized and exercised without discrimination of any kind, 1. Recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a global learning crisis that risks reversing decades of progress and exacerbating the barriers faced by all girls in the realization of their equal enjoyment of the right to education, and notes in this regard the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund and other United Nations agencies and bodies indicating that evidence from past epidemics shows that adolescent girls are at particular risk of dropping out of school or not returning to school, even after the crisis is over; 2. Reaffirms that the right to education, enshrined in international human rights law, can help enable the realization of many other human rights, particularly for girls; A/HRC/47/L.3 3. Recognizes that the realization of the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl is crucial to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goals 4 and 5, towards the full, equal and meaningful participation of all girls in society and to leave no one behind; 4. Calls upon States to place greater emphasis on ensuring at least 12 years of quality education for all girls in the COVID-19 recovery effort, as applicable, including catch-up, non-formal and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, and special, well-financed initiatives for keeping girls in school and ensuring their return to school throughout post-primary education, and to promote access to skills and entrepreneurship training for girls; 5. Urges all States: (a) To strengthen and intensify their efforts to take deliberate, concrete and targeted steps for every girl to fully realize the equal enjoyment of the right to education, to eliminate legal, administrative, financial, structural, physical, communication, social and cultural barriers that hinder girls’ equal enjoyment of the right to education, and to appropriately ensure non-discrimination in the admission of girls and boys at all levels of education, particularly when designing policy measures, programmes and resource allocations; (b) To review, repeal and eliminate, as appropriate, laws, policies and practices that negatively affect the right to education of every girl, in accordance with international human rights obligations, including discriminatory laws, policies, practices, customs, traditions or religious considerations, financial barriers, violence, including sexual violence and harassment on the way to and from school and in the school environment, the worst forms of child labour, early pregnancy, harmful practices such as female genital mutilation, gender stereotypes and child, early and forced marriage; (¢) To eliminate gender stereotypes from all educational processes, practices and teaching materials, including through periodic review and revision of school curricula, textbooks, programmes and teaching methods, and the inclusion of human rights education, including on gender equality and non-discrimination, as part of the mandatory school curriculum, and to ensure that all girls are encouraged to freely choose non-traditional fields of study; (d) Toprovide all girls with adequate access to water and safe, separate and quality sanitation facilities in schools and to promote appropriate hygiene behaviour and educational and health practices, in collaboration with civil society and other relevant actors, in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and girls are not stigmatized on this basis, addressing the negative social norms around the issue and recognizing that girls’ attendance at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls; 6. Calls upon States: (a) To promote the progressive realization of girls’ right to education by providing them with access to at least 12 years of quality education by implementing appropriate measures, as applicable, eliminating barriers to enable their return to school in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and promoting continuous education throughout the pandemic; (b) To strengthen and intensify their efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of school-related violence against girls, and to hold accountable those responsible for those acts; (¢) To ensure that girls, married and/or pregnant adolescents and young mothers, as well as single mothers, can continue and complete their education, and in this regard design, implement and, where applicable, revise educational policies to allow them to remain in and return to school, providing them with access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, as well as social services and financial and psychosocial support; 7. Also calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and A/HRC/47/L.3 secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school because of, inter alia, marriage, pregnancy and/or childbirth, on re-entry policies and on vocational training and skills development, which empower young women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate, age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, with information on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills, and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 8. Urges States to promote long-term awareness-raising initiatives in education, in communities, in the media and online, engaging men and boys, through the incorporation of curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, on topics including the root causes of gender-based discrimination; 9. Requests States to ensure equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality education, which may require transformations in education systems, mainstreaming a gender perspective into education programmes, infrastructure development and teacher training, and in this regard calls upon States to invest in quality education, including through adequate financing, to ensure all girls, including those who are marginalized or in vulnerable situations, enjoy their right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination; 10. Also requests States, in the COVID-19 recovery effort, to promote gender sensitivity and disability inclusion within education systems in planning, budgeting, implementing, monitoring and reporting, to gather data disaggregated by sex and disability and to share knowledge and experience on educational programmes and policies that support the empowerment of all girls and women; 11. Encourages States to support girls’ access to skills development and technical and vocational education and training, such as by expanding the scope of education and training opportunities ranging from basic digital fluency to advanced technical skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and in information and communications technology, and to close the digital gender divide, addressing the barriers to girls’ equal and safe access to online spaces, so as not to leave girls further behind, particularly during the mass closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic; 12. Also encourages States to increase investments and international cooperation to provide equal opportunities for all girls to complete free, equitable, inclusive and quality early childhood, primary and secondary education, including by scaling up and strengthening national, regional and international initiatives, as appropriate, such as the United Nations Girls’” Education Initiative, the Out-of-School Children Initiative, the Global Partnership for Education and the United Nations Population Fund-United Nations Children’s Fund Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage, and to explore additional innovative mechanisms based on models combining public and private resources, while taking appropriate action to ensure that all education providers are qualified and adequately trained and to give due respect to human rights, including the right to education; 13. Further encourages States to allocate appropriate financial and technical resources in support of country-led national education plans, as well as an increase in voluntary contributions to the Global Partnership for Education at the Global Education Summit in July 2021, which has a critical role to play in the global education recovery from COVID-19; 14. Encourages international cooperation to complement the efforts of States in matters relating to girls’ education, in particular with a view to effectively eliminating all forms of discrimination and stereotypes in education, and supports the efforts of the United Nations system in this regard; A/HRC/47/L.3 15. Reaffirms the importance of continuing to develop and enhance standards and methodologies at the national, regional and international levels to improve the collection, analysis and dissemination of gender statistics and data on access to education, in particular access to universal primary education, the gender gap in youth literacy, the number of out- of-school children, and others; 16. Also reaffirms the importance of enhancing the dialogue between the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UN-Women, the Special Rapporteur on the right to education and other partners that pursue the goals of girls’ education with a view to promoting further the right to education and ensuring that all girls have access to at least 12 years of quality education, as applicable, in the operational activities of the United Nations system; 17. Encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant special procedure mandate holders to give the required attention to realizing the equal enjoyment of the right to education by every girl in carrying out their mandates and in their reporting, and to work collectively towards its realization through practical and efficient steps; 18. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in consultation with States, United Nations agencies, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization, UN-Women, the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, the treaty bodies, civil society organizations and other stakeholders, to prepare a report on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the realization of the equal enjoyment ofthe right to education by every girl, highlighting the most important challenges and barriers that girls face and providing recommendations, for submission to the Human Rights Council, at its fiftieth session, and to provide an oral update thereon to the Council at its forty-ninth session; 19.

The International Solar Alliance, an initiative of India and France, was founded in 2015 at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris. In the Paris declaration regarding the launch of the Alliance, the shared vision of bringing clean, affordable and renewable energy within the reach of all was expounded. It set for the members the mission to mobilize more than $1 trillion in investments for the mass deployment of affordable solar energy by 2030. The then Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, attended the ceremony in Paris, on 30 November 2015, at which the Alliance was launched. Establishment of the International Solar Alliance 2. The international steering committee of the International Solar Alliance, established at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, deliberated on and finalized the framework agreement on the establishment of the Alliance and the institutional framework of the Alliance and its secretariat. The agreement was opened for signature at the twenty-second Conference of the Parties, in 2016, and entered into force on 6 December 2017 in accordance with article XIII of the agreement, with the Alliance acquiring the status of a treaty-based international organization. Subsequently, the framework agreement was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. The founding conference of the International Solar Alliance, held on 11 March 2018, saw the adoption of the “Delhi Solar Agenda”, in which the parties to the framework agreement reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 4. The framework agreement provides that the seat of the International Solar Alliance shall be in India. The Alliance signed a headquarters agreement with the Government of India on 26 March 2018 in which the international legal personality of the Alliance was recognized, consistent with article X of the framework agreement. Article X also provides that, in the territory of each member State and subject to its national laws and the conclusion of a separate agreement, if necessary, the Alliance may enjoy the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent discharge of its functions and programmes. Subsequently, after transferring all assets and liabilities to the first Assembly of the Alliance in October 2018, the international steering committee of the Alliance ceased to exist pursuant to article XIII of the framework agreement. Institutional and organizational structure Assembly 5. The Assembly of the International Solar Alliance, which was established under article IV of the framework agreement and includes representatives from each member State, is the chief decision-making body of the Alliance. The Assembly takes all necessary decisions on the implementation of the agreement and on coordinated action to be taken to achieve its objectives. It is chaired by the President and co-chaired by the Co-President, both elected by the Assembly for a term of two years. The President and the Co-President are supported by eight Vice-Presidents, two each from the four geographical regions of the Alliance — Africa, Asia and the Pacific, 5/20 A/76/192 Europe and others, and Latin America and the Caribbean — selected on the basis of seniority in terms of the submission of the instrument of ratifications to the depositary of the Alliance, that is, the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India. 6. The first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held on 3 October 2018. The Assembly adopted a number of significant decisions, including on the programme of work and budget, the approval of the provisional rules of procedure of the Assembly, the appointment of the Director General, a model agreement on privileges and immunities between the Alliance and individual member States, and the approval of the manual of regulations for the Alliance. Subsequent meetings of the Assembly were held in 2019 and 2020, with a special assembly convened in February 2021 to appoint the successor to the then Director General of the Alliance. Currently, India and France are the Co-Presidents of the Assembly. Standing committee 7. The standing committee, established by the Assembly, comprises the President, the Co-President, eight Vice-Presidents, and up to nine additional members who may be appointed in accordance with rule 79 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The standing committee is responsible and accountable to the Assembly and carries out the powers and functions entrusted to it under the rules of procedure, as well as those functions delegated to it by the Assembly. The committee is mandated, inter alia, to consider the programme of work and budget of the International Solar Alliance, to substantiate the approved programme of work, to take stock of Alliance programmes, to consider and recommend to the Assembly proposals with substantial financial implications for the Alliance, and to advise the secretariat on any emergent issues, upon request. Regional committees 8. To enhance regional cooperation and collaboration, a regional committee is established by the Assembly, under its rules of procedure, for each of the four regions of the International Solar Alliance. Each regional committee comprises the two Vice- Presidents selected from the region and all other Alliance members from the region. The regional committees are responsible and accountable to the Assembly. The regional committees serve as the forum for the regional coordination of views on matters related to the Assembly. The regional committees are mandated, inter alia, to support the harmonization and aggregation of demand, to review the scope of solar applications for members and to assess the aggregate effect of the Alliance programmes in the region. Secretariat 9. The secretariat is established pursuant to article V of the framework agreement. The members, Assembly and committees of the International Solar Alliance are supported by the secretariat to assist them in their collective work under the agreement and the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The secretariat comprises the Director General, who is the Chief Executive Officer, and other staff, as required. The standing committee of the Alliance has approved the provision of 12 international posts and 20 national posts at the Alliance secretariat, for which recruitment is in process. 10. The secretariat coordinates all programmes, activities and initiatives entrusted to it by the Assembly through the national focal points, appointed by each member State in accordance with article II of the framework agreement. 11. Article VIII of the framework agreement provides that partner organization status may be granted to organizations that have the potential to help the International 6/20 A/76/192 Solar Alliance to achieve its objectives. It is specifically stated therein that the United Nations, including its organs, will be the strategic partner of the Alliance. At its first meeting on 3 October 2018, the Assembly requested the secretariat to establish institutional links between the Alliance and the United Nations and authorized the secretariat to apply for observer status for the Alliance in the General Assembly of the United Nations. Membership 12. The International Solar Alliance was established as an alliance of solar-resource rich countries, with its membership open to the 121 States Members of the United Nations that lie fully or partially between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. However, on 3 October 2018, the first Assembly of the Alliance adopted a resolution proposed by India to amend the framework agreement of the Alliance to expand the scope of its membership to all Member States. The amendment entered into force on 8 January 2021 and was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. As of July 2021, 79 States members of the Alliance and 19 other States are expected to ratify the agreement. 13. The current membership of the International Solar Alliance covers a significant proportion of the global population. Moreover, a large proportion of the membership is comprised of the least developed countries and small island developing States that stand to benefit significantly from the programmes and activities of the Alliance.

Under the Paris declaration of the International Solar Alliance, the Alliance is mandated to promote collaboration and cooperation among its member States in order to lower the cost of solar energy and facilitate the massive and needs-based deployment of solar energy through innovative policies, projects, programmes, capacity-building measures and financial instruments. As an action-oriented organization, the Alliance was established to support and enhance the efforts of the global community aimed at meeting the collective ambition of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on Goals 7 and 13. 15. The International Solar Alliance lends its support to its member States across the three critical areas of energy access, energy security and energy transition. The strategic interventions of the Alliance are aimed at reducing the cost of technology and finance and at facilitating the mobilization of low-cost investment in the solar energy sector. 16. The International Solar Alliance plays the crucial roles of accelerator, enabler, incubator and facilitator of the deployment of clean and affordable solar energy at scale to address those key critical issues. As an accelerator, the Alliance supports the creation of economies of scale in the solar energy sector across its membership and the reduction of transaction costs to lower the cost of deploying solar energy in member States. As an enabler, it supports capacity-building interventions to create a well-qualified pool of human resources talent to drive solar energy programmes in member States. 17. In addition, the International Solar Alliance supports the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory ecosystem across its membership through knowledge creation and exchange. As an incubator, the Alliance supports, through its network of partnerships, the development and adoption of innovative financing and risk mitigation modalities across its membership to attract low-cost private and institutional finance. As a facilitator, it supports member States with developing viable solar energy road maps and integrating these with their overarching energy and climate objectives. Further, the Alliance facilitates the mobilization of finance for solar energy projects. 18. To achieve the vision and mission of the International Solar Alliance, the following guiding principles for members of the Alliance are set down in article II of its framework agreement: (a) Members take coordinated actions through programmes and activities launched on a voluntary basis, aimed at better harmonizing and aggregating demand 9/20 A/76/192 for, inter alia, solar finance, solar technologies, innovation, research and development, and capacity-building; (b) In this endeavour, members cooperate closely and strive to establish mutually beneficial relationships with relevant organizations, public and private stakeholders, and non-member States; (c) For those solar applications for which it seeks the benefits of collective action under the Alliance and on the basis of a common analytical mapping of solar applications, each member shares and updates relevant information regarding its needs and objectives, domestic measures and initiatives taken or intended to be taken in order to achieve these objectives, and obstacles along the value chain and dissemination process. The secretariat maintains a database of these assessments in order to highlight the potential for cooperation. VI. Funding 19. The International Solar Alliance was conceived as a voluntary alliance of sovereign countries with no membership fee. Article VI of its framework agreement outlines the sources of funding, which include voluntary contributions from member States, partner organizations including regional economic integration organizations and the United Nations and its agencies, and the private sector as potential sources of funding for the Alliance. The revenue generated from specific activities, approved by the Assembly, are additional sources of finance for the Alliance. 20. India, the host country of the International Solar Alliance, made an initial contribution of $16 million to the Alliance corpus fund, in addition to its contribution to the recurring expenditure of the Alliance for five years from 2016 to 2021. 21. Myanmar and the Comoros have made voluntary contributions to the corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance. France, the co-founder of the Alliance, has provided initial support through the provision of two experts to the Alliance secretariat, as well as initial support of €50,000 for the programme to enable solar technical centres in member States. In addition, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Australia have made financial and/or in- kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 22. The partner organizations of the International Solar Alliance, such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Union, the French Development Agency, the Climate Investment Funds and the World Resources Institute, have also made financial and in-kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 23. Asof March 2021, the total corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance stood at $33.5 million, with contributions amounting to $17.5 million from the corporate sector. VII. Programme and projects 24. The International Solar Alliance has launched seven thematic programmes since its inception that are dedicated to the deployment of cross-cutting solar energy applications across multiple sectors, including agriculture, health and electricity. The programmes of the Alliance are intended to provide a holistic solution to the triple challenge of energy access, energy security and energy transition through a blend of small-scale off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications and large 10/20 A/76/192 utility-scale projects. The following are the seven thematic programmes of the Alliance: (a) Scaling solar applications for agricultural use. This programme is focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications, including solar water pumping systems, solar energy-based drinking water applications and water, sanitation and hygiene interventions; solar home lighting and other off-grid lighting solutions; and solar energy-based cold storage; (b) Affordable finance at scale. This is an overarching programme dedicated to identifying and promoting innovative financing modalities and risk mitigation instruments to lower the cost of finance in the solar energy sector; (c) Scaling solar mini-grids. This programme is dedicated to promoting the electrification of regions that have yet to establish grid connectivity; (d) Scaling solar rooftop. This programme is dedicated to the promotion of solar rooftop applications for industrial, commercial and government consumers; (e) Scaling solar e-mobility and storage. This programme is dedicated to promoting e-mobility solutions based on solar energy, solar-powered charging infrastructure and energy storage solutions at scale; (f) Solar park. This programme complements other programmes that are focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications to meet the challenge of energy access. It focuses on deploying large utility-scale ground- mounted solar projects to support member States in integrating solar energy into their energy mix at the speed and scale necessary to meet the challenges of energy security and energy transition; (g) Solar heating and cooling. This programme is dedicated to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the rapidly increasing heating and cooling requirements across the membership of the Alliance. The programme encompasses the industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential sectors. 25. In addition to the thematic programmes, the International Solar Alliance has launched specific sectoral interventions, such as the “ISA CARES” initiative, which is aimed at solarizing the health sector to address the challenge of energy access, with a particular focus on developing and least developed countries. The aim of the initiative is to provide not only solar energy-based electricity but additional infrastructure such as solar-powered vaccine cold chains and mobile health clinics. VIII. Capacity-building programmes 26. The International Solar Alliance has been equally receptive to the capacity- building needs of its member States to develop and manage solar assets, including those to be deployed under its thematic programmes and other initiatives. The Alliance is working to support its members in developing capacity to deploy scaled- up solar applications through the development of a network of technical training, entrepreneurship, research and innovation centres in order to harmonize and deliver training programmes using a network of training facilities that would be recognized across the member States. 27. The Solar Technology Applications and Resources Centre network will facilitate the exchange of best practices and promote knowledge dissemination and capacity - building with regard to solar energy, supporting stakeholders across the full deployment process (including technicians, master trainers, project developers, engineers and policymakers). In addition, the network is aimed at supporting the 11/20 A/76/192 standardization of solar technology applications and supporting collaborative research and development, including with the private sector. IX. Projects in individual countries 28. The International Solar Alliance has launched an initiative, approved at its third Assembly, to facilitate, through technical and financial support, solar energy demonstration projects across 47 least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States of the Alliance — 26 countries from the African region, 12 from the Asia and the Pacific region and 9 from the Latin American and the Caribbean region. 29. The initiative is aimed at deploying projects for developing resilience in the agriculture and health sectors. The selection of projects would be member-driven. As of February 2021, project proposals have been received from 16 member States among the least developed countries and small island developing States, while discussions with the remaining least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States are under way. 30. The goal of the International Solar Alliance is to facilitate affordable access for member States to funding for solar projects. To this end, through a partnership between the Alliance, the World Bank and the French Development Agency, the solar risk mitigation initiative was launched at the twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Although the cost of solar energy is constantly falling, its deployment remains slow in certain emerging markets, notably in Africa, where a belief is held in the private sector that the funding of solar projects entails too many risks. The solar risk mitigation initiative is aimed at reversing this trend. It involves the creation of the following: (a) A technical assistance programme for developing sustainable solar projects (support for planning, resource mapping and electrical sector reform) and the solar deployment guidelines, which help countries to identify clear and stable solar goals; (b) A new procurement platform, which will be launched online and will be used to facilitate and collect solar project bids; (c) Hedging instruments to protect against the financial risks inherent in renewable energy production projects, in order to guarantee the solvency of the suppliers. 31. The International Solar Alliance, in partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, is also facilitating a pilot project for solar-powered food and vaccine cold chain technologies in Nigeria. The project is aimed at demonstrating innovative and low-cost technologies that are run on self-sustaining financial models. 32. The International Solar Alliance has signed an agreement with the African Development Bank to harness solar energy. The basic objective of the joint declaration, as mentioned in the agreement, was to develop a road map to mobilize financing for the promotion of solar energy in prospective African International Solar Alliance member States. 12/20 A/76/192 X. Observer status for the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly 33. The primary objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Accelerating the transition towards a low-carbon economy and boosting investments in infrastructure for renewable energy, notably solar power, is therefore critical to realizing the goals of the Agreement. 34. Accordingly, solar energy is an important constituent of renewable energy as an alternative source owing to its wider availability as well as its affordability. The International Solar Alliance is being established at a time when there is a growing need for renewable energy as an alternative source of energy at both the global and regional levels. 35. The International Solar Alliance is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations sustainable development process and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. The primary goal of the Alliance is to lower the cost of finance and spur investments across the solar supply chain, including in manufacturing, project development and storage. 36. The aims, objectives and activities of the International Solar Alliance as set out in the framework agreement and its activities as reflected in the programmes are relevant to the work of the General Assembly in the area of renewable energy. The Alliance is striving to promote the massive deployment of solar energy globally and thereby provide energy security and promote sustainable development in its member States. 37. The promotion of solar energy in the context of the health infrastructure in developing countries supports the achievement of Goal 3, aimed at ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. 38. The various activities of the International Solar Alliance advance many of the objectives of the Paris Agreement and thus contribute to addressing the challenges posed by global warming. 39. The International Solar Alliance plays an important role internationally in supporting the implementation of several United Nations conventions on climate change and the global climate change agenda in general. The participation of the Alliance in major international meetings involving these issues is often critical for the Alliance to carry out its work and mandate. In addition, the Alliance has the wide- ranging resources and expertise needed to make a significant contribution to all such meetings, dialogues and decisions by helping to shape the global policy dialogue and supporting its implementation on solar energy. 40. Since the entry into force of the amendment to the framework agreement on 8 January 2021, the membership of the International Solar Alliance has been universalized and is open to all States Members of the United Nations. It is expected to expand quickly, giving a boost to the efforts of the Alliance to promote the use of solar energy globally. 41. The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance explicitly designates the United Nations, including its organs, as a strategic partner of the Alliance. Observer status will greatly enhance the ability of the Alliance to achieve its goals. The Alliance will be able to follow the deliberations in the General Assembly closely, to cooperate with United Nations organs, agencies and programmes in the implementation of its programmes and activities and to benefit 13/20 A/76/192 from the United Nations through its network of field offices, experience in programme cooperation with Governments, and extensive resources in the development process. 42. We believe that the International Solar Alliance can contribute positively to the fields of sustainable development, renewable energy and climate change and can enhance the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. 43. Granting observer status to the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly would enable the Alliance to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes on the basis of grass-root level experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. The Alliance is also taking a big step towards addressing issues such as technology transfer, the storage of solar energy, and even financial assistance to member States, along with project layout and project planning measures. 44. Cooperation between the United Nations and the International Solar Alliance has the potential to support progress towards building national capacities to reduce poverty and exclusion, enhancing sustainable human development and achieving nationally and internationally agreed development goals. The initiatives of the United Nations and the Alliance can serve as a powerful tool for addressing the challenges faced by developing countries and accelerating progress towards the Goals, and specifically Goal 7: to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. 45. The International Solar Alliance, through its efforts to bring about just and equitable energy solutions through the deployment of solar energy, is expected to usher in a new era of green energy diplomacy. The granting of observer status to the Alliance in the General Assembly would help to provide for regular and well-defined cooperation between the Alliance and the United Nations that would benefit global clean energy growth and sustainable development. 14/20 A/76/192 Annex I1 Framework Agreement on the establishment of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) We, the Parties to this Agreement, Recalling the Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance of 30"" November 2015 and the shared ambition to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than US $ 1000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy, and pave the way for future technologies adapted to the needs, Recognizing that solar energy provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to their peoples, Acknowledging the specific and common obstacles that still stand in the way of rapid and massive scale-up of solar energy in these countries, Affirming that these obstacles can be addressed if solar resource rich countries act in a coordinated manner, with strong political impulse and resolve, and that better harmonizing and aggregating the demand for inter alia solar finance, technologies, innovation or capacity building, across countries, will provide a strong lever to lower costs, increase quality, and bring reliable and affordable solar energy within the reach of all, United in their desire to establish an effective mechanism of coordination and decision-making among them, Have agreed as follows: Article I Objective Parties hereby establish an International Solar Alliance (hereinafter referred to as the ISA), through which they will collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in line with their needs.

convinced that this should guide the design and deployment of United Nations peace operations, and understanding United Nations peace operations as peacekeeping operations and special political missions, Recognising the crucial role peacekeeping plays in creating conditions for stability and lasting peace, and the need for United Nations peace operations to have integrated strategies that articulate a clear pathway to transition and to achieving sustainable peace, and wunderlining that transitions of United Nations Peace Operations are understood as a strategic process which builds towards a reconfiguration of the strategy, footprint, and capacity of the United Nations in a way that supports peacebuilding objectives and the development of a sustainable peace, in a manner that supports and reinforces national ownership, informed by the operational context and the national priorities and needs of the host State and its population, and that includes engagement with local community and civil society, and, where relevant, regional and sub-regional organisations, and other relevant stakeholders, with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and the inclusion of youth and persons with disabilities, Reiterating the primary responsibility of States to protect the population throughout their territories, recognising that reconfigurations of missions may entail increased risks for civilians, in particular for women, youth, children, persons with disabilities, and, where relevant, the need to enhance States’ capacity to protect their own civilians,

sequenced, mandated tasks and, where appropriate, a clear prioritisation of tasks to achieve this outcome, reflecting the need to create favourable conditions for sustainable peace, understanding prioritisation as the mission focussing on those specific mandated tasks which are based on up-to-date conflict analysis and planning and are assessed as responding to the evolving needs on the ground, and further understanding sequencing as a logical, flexible implementation of the mandate over time, in line with the strategic vision as set out 2/6 S/2021/771 in the mandate, aligned with the peace and security needs within the host State, building towards a consolidation of peace, Recognising that the effective implementation of peacekeeping mandates is the responsibility of all stakeholders and is contingent upon several critical factors, including well-defined, realistic and achievable mandates, political will, leadership, performance and accountability at all levels,

population are taken into account, which encompasses activities, including promotion of justice and accountability, aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, continuation and recurrence of conflict, addressing root causes, assisting parties to conflict to end hostilities, ensuring national reconciliation, and moving towards recovery, reconstruction and development, and emphasising that

and the report of the Secretary-General on the issue of child, early and forced marriage,3 Recognizing that urgent action and long-term responses are required to address crisis situations and their root causes, inter alia armed conflict, natural disasters, political instability, post-conflict situations, complex emergencies, socioeconomic strife and pandemics, representing a critical threat to the health, safety, security and/or well-being of a community or other large group of people, usually over a wide area, Noting with concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage are highly exacerbated in times of crisis and in humanitarian settings by various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, the use of rape, child, early and forced marriage and other forms of sexual violence as tactics in conflict prohibited under international law, lack of access to education, the stigma of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services and contraception, and respective social services that prevent and respond to violence, disruptions in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that crises give rise to conditions in which new human rights violations and abuses are often perpetrated and existing human rights violations and abuses often intensify and expand, Noting the gains made in ending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease in the proportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the last decade, from one in four to approximately one in five, while expressing deep concern that progress has been uneven across regions, that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are projected to result in 10 to 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that may have been averted by 2030 and that the current pace of change is therefore not sufficient to fulfil the commitment under target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, and in this regard recognizing the need for closer cooperation between States, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic gender-based discrimination faced by women and girls, especially women and girls with disabilities and others in vulnerable situations, including patriarchy, the persistence of historical and structural gender inequalities, racism, stigma, xenophobia and socioeconomic inequalities, and has increased the occurrence of sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, Noting with deep concern that the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including physical school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, will have wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences, during and after the pandemic, and are likely to increase risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence and unintended and/or early pregnancy, which may be either a cause or a consequence of increased child, early and forced marriage, as well as risks related to trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, unsafe abortion and preventable maternal mortality and 2 A/HRC/41/19. 3 A/75/262. A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 morbidity, that economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work borne by women and girls and the associated risk of their not returning to school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services hinder the fulfilment of the human rights of all women and girls and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations and for women and girls in vulnerable situations, Strongly condemning attacks on and abductions of all girls, deploring all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions, their students and staff, and urging States to protect them from attacks, Deeply concerned that funding for the promotion of the human rights of women and girls, including for the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, is often among the first things to be reduced during situations of crisis, that child, early and forced marriage and sexual and reproductive health needs remain largely unaddressed in crisis settings, and that the COVID-19 containment measures are often delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes, including education programmes on child, early and forced marriage, and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for those affected, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, that it is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence against women and girls and other harmful practices and human rights violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of structural and institutional discrimination against women and girls, deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal traditions, discriminatory norms, gender stereotypes, perceptions and customs and disregard for women’s dignity, bodily integrity and autonomy, that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned also that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and other forms of sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to freely choose a spouse, to enter into marriage only with free and full consent and to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and recognizing that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect and consent and the freedom to choose whether to marry and whether to have sexual relations, Deeply concerned that poverty, insecurity, lack of sustainable development, lack of access to education and health services and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities and that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies and other crises are among the exacerbating factors, and stressing the need to promote sustainable development and eradicate poverty, A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 Deeply concerned also that child, early and forced marriage disproportionately affects girls and young women who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma relating to menstruation and social and gender norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities, as well as access to education and explaining consent and respecting boundaries, are some of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities and the active participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision- making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development and their full, effective and meaningful participation in economic, social, political and public life, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing also that the economic autonomy of women and investment in women’s and girls” development are priorities in and of themselves, have a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including but not limited to sexual and reproductive health, and the critical importance of ensuring that health-care services have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing all forms of discrimination, and recognizing the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions and access to comprehensive health-related education and information, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported, and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, in particular at the community level, and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and possible retribution, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of providing legal aid services with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and addressing gender inequality, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, men and boys, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate sexual and gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and to confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision- making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, organizations led or initiated by young people and feminist groups, Recognizing also that the criminalization alone of child, early and forced marriage is insufficient when introduced without complementary, comprehensive and multisectoral measures and support programmes, including across the health, gender equality and A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 education sectors and with the engagement of the whole community, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of, and the loss of livelihoods for, the families affected and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of child, early and forced informal unions or unregistered marriages, 1. Urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, which include the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution, to guarantee equal access for every girl and woman to quality education, as well as education explaining consent, respect for boundaries and what constitutes unacceptable behaviour and how to report it, that builds self-esteem and informed decision-making and communication skills and promotes the development of respectful relationships based on gender equality, inclusion and human rights, skills development programmes, vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities, counselling, social services to protect them from all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and domestic and intimate-partner violence, formal employment to increase their economic independence, and psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services and medical care, to decrease their social isolation and to increase their economic and political participation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 2.

Urges States to take comprehensive, multisectoral and rights-based measures to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, including in times of crisis, and to address structural and underlying causes and risk factors, including by: (a) Addressing the root causes of gender inequality, including structural, institutional, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination against women and girls, patriarchal values, discriminatory norms, gender stereotypes, perceptions and customs and harmful social norms, attitudes and behaviours, the socioeconomic drivers of violence and unequal power relations, which perpetuate child, early and forced marriage; (b) Eliminating discrimination against women and girls in all matters relating to marriage, and guaranteeing women and girls’ equality in law and in practice in family life, by opposing all forms of marriage that constitute a violation of the human rights of women and girls and their well-being and dignity; (c) Respecting, protecting and fulfilling the human rights of all women and girls to have control over, and decide freely and responsibly on, matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and with respect to bodily integrity, autonomy and agency of women and girls, and adopting and accelerating the implementation of laws, policies and programmes that protect and enable the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including reproductive rights; (d) Taking immediate and effective action to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, domestic and intimate partner violence and marital rape; A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 (e) Upholding all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls with disabilities, and recognizing that disability can increase the risk of child, early and forced marriage, and the importance of ensuring that services and programmes designed to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage are inclusive of, and accessible to, women and girls with disabilities; 4. Calls upon States to promote and protect the right of all women and girls to equal access to education, including in times of crisis, by: (a) Ensuring access to free and quality primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school because of, inter alia, marriage, pregnancy and/or childbirth, re-entry policies and vocational training and skills development, which empower young women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate, age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, with information on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk-reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health- care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; (b) Adopting measures to ensure the equal access for girls to quality education, to eliminate discriminatory laws and practices that prevent them from having access to, completing and continuing their education, including the transition from primary to secondary education, and provide incentive mechanisms to this end, to develop and implement programmes, as appropriate, that specifically aim to eliminate gender disparities in enrolment and gender-based bias and stereotypes in education systems, curricula and materials, whether derived from any discriminatory practices, social or cultural attitudes or legal and economic circumstances, and to ensure continued efforts to eliminate all forms of school-related violence against girls, including online, and eliminate obstacles faced by them in access to and use of information and communications technologies, and reaffirming the importance of the right to education as a key to the empowerment of all women and girls and for ensuring equality and non-discrimination; (c) Ensuring that married and/or pregnant adolescents and young mothers, as well as single mothers, can continue and complete their education, after childbirth, marriage or the dissolution of marriage, by designing, implementing and, where applicable, revising educational policies and programmes to allow them to remain in and return to school and to develop livelihood opportunities through access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills education, including financial literacy, and by providing them with access to health-care services, including for sexual and reproductive health and for family planning, and social services and support, including childcare and breastfeeding facilities and créches, and to education programmes with accessible locations, flexible schedules and distance education, including e-learning, and bearing in mind the important role and responsibilities of fathers, including young fathers, in this regard; (d) Mitigating the impact of school closures in times of crisis, in particular for those learners who are among the poorest and most marginalized, especially girls, by facilitating access to, and the continuity of, equitable and inclusive quality education for all, including through distance learning, re-enrolling all previously enrolled children and those who were already out of school, providing community awareness on the importance of girls’ education and working to ensure that those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, pregnant girls and women, as well as young parents, also continue to have access to schooling on an equal basis with others, including by enabling access to the Internet and bridging the digital divides, both between and within countries, and the gender digital divide; (e) Continuing to strengthen the protection of preschools, schools and universities against attacks, making them free from all forms of violence, including by taking measures to deter the military use of schools, such as by considering implementing the Guidelines for A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict, and encouraging efforts to provide safe, non-violent, inclusive, effective and enabling learning environments and quality education for all, within an appropriate time frame, including all levels of education in the context of humanitarian emergencies and conflict situations; 5. Urges States, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, communities, not-for-profit organizations and civil society organizations, including in times of crisis, to tackle poverty, the lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives and inequalities that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage and as obstacles to leaving a forced or abusive relationship, and to promote sustainable development, including by: (a) Ensuring the rights of all women and girls to inheritance and property, their access equal to that of men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, and promoting freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as their full, equal and meaningful political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; (b) Ensuring gender-responsive social protection mechanisms, adopting measures to recognize, reduce and redistribute women’s and girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the feminization of poverty, which is exacerbated in times of crisis, including by the COVID-19 pandemic, and addressing the discrimination and gender inequality, including gender stereotypes and harmful social norms, attitudes and behaviours and unequal power relations in which women and girls are viewed as subordinate to men and boys, that are at the root of these imbalances; (¢) Confronting family poverty and social exclusion by investing in family- oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 6. Also urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, by: (a) Developing and enforcing policies and legal frameworks on and strengthening health systems, including health information systems, that ensure uninterrupted, universally accessible, acceptable, affordable and available quality, gender-responsive, adolescent- friendly health services, sexual and reproductive health-care services, information, education and commodities, HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, treatment and care, mental health services and psychosocial support, equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, including menstrual health and hygiene and nutrition interventions and prevention and treatment of, and care for, obstetric fistula and other obstetric complications, by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care, free from mistreatment and violence, as essential services in times of crisis, and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services; (b) Ensuring continuity and further strengthening protection and support services for women and girls who experience all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and domestic violence, in times of crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, especially girls at risk of child, early and forced marriage and already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice, and designating protection shelters, hotlines and help desks, health and support services and legal protection and support as essential services available to all women and girls, in addition to establishing safeguarding measures and raising awareness and providing training for police, members of the judiciary, first responders, health workers and education and child services staff; 7. Further urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and that respect and protect bodily integrity and autonomy, protecting those at risk, including in times of crisis, and supporting women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses, and to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution; 8. Calls upon States to ensure that all initiatives to , amend and implement criminal laws addressing child, early and forced marriage are part of comprehensive rights- based, gender-responsive and cross-government prevention and response strategies and coupled with protection measures and services for victims, survivors and those who are at risk of being subjected to harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage; 9. Urges States to remove any provisions that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims, in particular by repealing or amending such laws; 10. Encourages States to increase public funding for community-based organizations, including organizations led or initiated by young people, including girls, focusing on the human rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, including in times of crisis, and to mitigate the impact of crisis response measures on the ability of civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders working at the local and national levels to continue their work with girls, families and local communities to prevent and respond to child, early and forced marriage; 11. Also encourages States to consult with civil society organizations, including girl-led and youth-led organizations, as well as community-based organizations, focusing on the rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, in crisis response planning and delivery to ensure that the needs of women and girls affected by child, early and forced marriage are not overlooked and are adequately addressed in crisis response and that crisis response measures do not exacerbate factors that contribute to child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices or to sexual and gender-based violence; 12. Urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and protecting the rights of women and girls subjected to this harmful practice, including by informing women, girls and boys about their rights under relevant laws, including in marriage and at its dissolution, improving legal infrastructure, mainstreaming gender equality and human rights perspectives into justice systems, ensuring equal access to legal aid, including legal advice, assistance and representation, as well as access to judicial and other legal remedies, addressing legal inconsistencies, training law enforcement officers, members of the judiciary and professionals working with women and children and ensuring oversight of the handling of cases of child, early and forced marriage, and working to ensure that these mechanisms and remedies remain accessible in times of crisis or are re-established as quickly as possible when affected by crisis; 13.

Calls upon States to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages, as well as working to ensure that the registration of births and marriages remains accessible in times of crisis or is re-established as quickly as possible when affected by crisis; 15. Affirms the need for States and relevant United Nations entities and agencies to improve the collection and use of quantitative, qualitative and comparable data, while observing the principles of confidentiality, informed consent and voluntary self- identification, on violence against women and harmful practices, including in humanitarian settings and in the context of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, A/HRC/48/L.7/Rev.1 disaggregated by sex, age, disability, civil status, race, ethnicity, migratory status, geographical location, socioeconomic status, education level and other key factors, as appropriate, to enhance research on, and the dissemination of, evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, and to strengthen monitoring and the assessment of the impact of existing policies and programmes as a means of ensuring their effectiveness and implementation; 16. Calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of, and active consultation with, children, adolescents and youth, including already married girls, on all issues affecting them, to strengthen their voice, agency and leadership, to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, including in digital spaces, that provide information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, and lifelong learning opportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, that empower them, allow them to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities, and to encourage men and boys to also act for change in their communities through being more involved in information and awareness-raising campaigns, intergenerational dialogues and peer education and training programmes, in partnership with women and girls; 17. Decides, in order to increase understanding about the concept of forced marriage, to request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize a two-full-day workshop focusing on the adverse impact of forced marriage on the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner to submit a report on the workshop in an accessible format to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-second session; 18. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to organize the above- mentioned workshop with the participation and involvement of women and girls at risk of, and those subjected to, forced marriage and to collaborate with all relevant stakeholders, including relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, special procedure mandate holders, international and regional organizations, States, scholars, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations, in order to ensure multi-stakeholder participation at the workshop.",10/07/2021,2021_3943183,Denmark,* State not a member of the Human Rights Council. !

Child, early and forced marriage in times of crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic","The Human Rights Council, Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other relevant human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, Reaffirming its resolutions 24/23 of 27 September 2013, 29/8 of 2 July 2015, 35/16 of 22 June 2017 and 41/8 of 11 July 2019, recalling its resolution 47/5 of 12 July 2021, and recalling also General Assembly resolutions 69/156 of 18 December 2014, 71/175 of 19 December 2016, 73/153 of 17 December 2018 and 75/167 of December 2020, Reaffirming also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, as well as the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the outcome documents of their review conferences, and the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on universal health coverage,' Recalling the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third International Conference on Financing for £ Please recycle @ GE.21-13850(E) A/HRC/48/L.7 Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda, and noting the integrated and indivisible nature of the 2030 Agenda and the range of goals, targets and indicators relevant to preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, including target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recalling also the relevant agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women, and taking note of the guidance note of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, issued in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, aimed at mitigating the devastating impact of the pandemic, in particular on all women and girls, Welcoming the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on child, early and forced marriage in humanitarian settings,? and the report of the Secretary-General on the issue of child, early and forced marriage,’ Recognizing that urgent action and long-term responses are required to address crisis situations, which may include, among other things, armed conflict, natural disasters, political instability, post-conflict situations, complex emergencies, socioeconomic strife and pandemics, representing a critical threat to the health, safety, security and/or well-being of a community or other large group of people, usually over a wide area, Noting with concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage are highly exacerbated in times of crisis and in humanitarian settings by various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, the use of rape, child, early and forced marriage and other forms of sexual violence as tactics in conflict prohibited under international law, lack of access to education, the stigma of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services and contraception, and respective social services that prevent and respond to violence, disruptions in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that crises give rise to conditions in which new human rights violations and abuses are often perpetrated and existing human rights violations and abuses often intensify and expand, Noting the gains made in ending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease in the proportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the last decade, from one in four to approximately one in five, while expressing deep concern that progress has been uneven across regions, that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are projected to result in 10 to 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that may have been averted by 2030 and that the current pace of change is therefore not sufficient to fulfil the commitment under target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, and in this regard recognizing the need for closer cooperation between States, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated pre-existing forms of inequality and systemic gender-based discrimination faced by women and girls, especially women and girls with disabilities and others in vulnerable situations, including patriarchy, the persistence of historical and structural gender inequalities, racism, stigma, xenophobia and socioeconomic inequalities, and has increased the occurrence of sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, Noting with deep concern that the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including physical school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, will have wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences, during and after the pandemic, and are likely to increase risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence and unintended and/or early pregnancy, which may be either a cause or a consequence of increased child, early and forced marriage, as well as risks related to trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, unsafe abortion and preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, that economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work borne by women and girls and the associated risk of their not returning to 2 A/HRC/41/19. 3 A/75/262. A/HRC/48/L.7 school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services hinder the fulfilment of the human rights of all women and girls and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations and for women and girls in vulnerable situations, Strongly condemning attacks on and abductions of all girls, deploring all attacks, including terrorist attacks, on educational institutions, their students and staff, and urging States to protect them from attacks, Deeply concerned that funding for the promotion of the human rights of women and girls, including for the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, is often among the first things to be reduced during situations of crisis, that child, early and forced marriage and sexual and reproductive health needs remain largely unaddressed in crisis settings, and that the COVID-19 containment measures are often delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes, including education programmes on child, early and forced marriage, and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for those affected, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, that it is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence against women and girls and other harmful practices and human rights violations and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate the practice of child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of structural and institutional discrimination against women and girls, deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal traditions, discriminatory norms, gender stereotypes, perceptions and customs and disregard for women’s dignity, bodily integrity and autonomy, that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage, as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, Deeply concerned also that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and other forms of sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Reaffirming that human rights include the right to freely choose a spouse, to enter into marriage only with free and full consent and to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and recognizing that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect and consent and the freedom to choose whether to marry and whether to have sexual relations, Deeply concerned that poverty, insecurity, lack of access to education and health services and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of child, early and forced marriage, that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities and that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies and other crises are among the exacerbating factors, and stressing the need to promote sustainable development and eradicate poverty, Deeply concerned also that child, early and forced marriage disproportionately affects girls and young women who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a A/HRC/48/L.7 significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma relating to menstruation and social and gender norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities, as well as access to education and information on sexual and reproductive health, including on explaining consent and respecting boundaries, are some of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities and the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development and their full, equal, effective and meaningful participation in economic, social, political and public life, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing also that the economic autonomy of women and investment in women’s and girls’ development are priorities in and of themselves, have a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and sexual and gender based violence inflicted by a current or former partner or spouse, Recognizing further the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including but not limited to sexual and reproductive health, and the critical importance of ensuring that health-care services have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing all forms of discrimination, and recognizing the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions and access to comprehensive health-related education and information, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported, and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, in particular at the community level, and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and possible retribution, and in this regard emphasizing the importance of providing legal aid services with a view to promoting and protecting human rights and addressing gender inequality, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, men and boys, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate sexual and gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and to confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision- making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, organizations led or initiated by young people and feminist groups, Recognizing also that the criminalization alone of child, early and forced marriage is insufficient when introduced without complementary, comprehensive and multisectoral measures and support programmes, including across the health, gender equality and A/HRC/48/L.7 education sectors and with the engagement of the whole community, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of, and the loss of livelihoods for, the families affected and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of child, early and forced informal unions or unregistered marriages, 1. Urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of all women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, which include the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution, to guarantee equal access for every girl and woman to quality education, as well as education explaining consent, respect for boundaries and what constitutes unacceptable behaviour and how to report it, that builds self-esteem and informed decision-making and communication skills and promotes the development of respectful relationships based on gender equality, inclusion and human rights, skills development programmes, vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities, counselling, social services to protect them from all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence and domestic and intimate-partner violence, formal employment to increase their economic independence, and psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services and medical care, to decrease their social isolation and to increase their economic and political participation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 2.

Urges States, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, including the private sector, communities, not-for-profit organizations and civil society organizations, including in times of crisis, to tackle poverty, the lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives and inequalities that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage and as obstacles to leaving a forced or abusive relationship, and to promote sustainable development, including by: (a) Ensuring the rights of all women and girls to inheritance and property, their access equal to that of men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, and promoting freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as full, equal and meaningful political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; (b) Ensuring gender-responsive social protection mechanisms, adopting measures to recognize, reduce and redistribute women’s and girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the feminization of poverty, which is exacerbated in times of crisis, including by the COVID-19 pandemic, and addressing the discrimination and gender inequality, including gender stereotypes and harmful social norms, attitudes and behaviours and unequal power relations in which women and girls are viewed as subordinate to men and boys, that are at the root of these imbalances; (¢) Confronting family poverty and social exclusion by investing in family- oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 6.

Encourages States to increase public funding for community-based organizations, including organizations led or initiated by young people, including girls, focusing on the human rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, including in times of crisis, and to mitigate the impact of crisis response measures on the ability of civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders working at the local and national levels to continue their work with girls, families and local communities to prevent and respond to child, early and forced marriage; 11. Also encourages States to consult with civil society organizations, including girl-led and youth-led organizations, as well as community-based organizations, focusing on the rights of women and girls and child, early and forced marriage, in crisis response planning and delivery to ensure that the needs of women and girls affected by child, early and forced marriage are not overlooked and are adequately addressed in crisis response and that crisis response measures do not exacerbate factors that contribute to child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices or to sexual and gender-based violence; 12. Urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and protecting the rights of women and girls subjected to this harmful practice, including by informing women, girls and boys about their rights under relevant laws, including in marriage and at its dissolution, improving legal infrastructure, mainstreaming gender equality and human rights perspectives into justice systems, ensuring equal access to legal aid, including legal advice, assistance and representation, as well as access to judicial and other legal remedies, addressing legal inconsistencies, training law enforcement officers, members of the judiciary and professionals working with women and children and ensuring oversight of the handling of cases of child, early and forced marriage, and working to ensure that these mechanisms and remedies remain accessible in times of crisis or are re-established as quickly as possible when affected by crisis; 13.

Affirms the need for States and relevant United Nations entities and agencies to improve the collection and use of quantitative, qualitative and comparable data, while A/HRC/48/L.7 observing the principles of confidentiality, informed consent and voluntary self- identification, on violence against women and harmful practices, including in humanitarian settings and in the context of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, disaggregated by sex, age, disability, civil status, race, ethnicity, migratory status, geographical location, socioeconomic status, education level and other key factors, as appropriate, to enhance research on, and the dissemination of, evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage, and to strengthen monitoring and the assessment of the impact of existing policies and programmes as a means of ensuring their effectiveness and implementation; 16. Calls upon States to promote the meaningful participation of, and active consultation with, children, adolescents and youth, including already married girls, on all issues affecting them, to strengthen their voice, agency and leadership, to raise awareness about their rights, including the negative impact of child, early and forced marriage, through safe spaces, forums and support networks, including in digital spaces, that provide information, life skills and leadership skills training and opportunities, including catch-up and literacy education, and lifelong learning opportunities, remote learning opportunities and childcare, as needed, that empower them, allow them to express themselves, to participate meaningfully in all decisions that affect them and to become agents of change within their communities, and to encourage men and boys to also act for change in their communities through being more involved in information and awareness-raising campaigns, intergenerational dialogues and peer education and training programmes, in partnership with the full, equal effective and meaningful participation of women and girls; 17. Decides, in order to increase understanding about the concept of forced marriage, to request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to organize a two-full-day expert meeting focusing on the adverse impact of forced marriage on the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner to submit to the Human Rights Council at its fifty- second session a report in accessible formats on the expert meeting; 18. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to organize the above- mentioned expert meeting with the participation and involvement of women and girls at risk of, and those subjected to, forced marriage and to collaborate with all relevant stakeholders, including relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, special procedure mandate holders, international and regional organizations, scholars, national human rights institutions and civil society organizations, in order to ensure multi-stakeholder participation at the expert meeting.",10/04/2021,2021_3943184,Denmark,* State not a member of the Human Rights Council. !

Commissioner on 27 and 28 May 2020, that noted the steadily growing impact of the use of artificial intelligence technologies on the exercise of the right to privacy, pointed to transparency concerns regarding personal data collection and exchanges underlying parts of artificial intelligence systems and expressed concern about adverse privacy impacts of the application of artificial intelligence, Welcoming also the work of various special procedure mandate holders of the Human Rights Council on the right to privacy, and taking note of their contributions to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy, Please recycle @ GE.21-14142(E) A/HRC/48/L.9/Rev.1 Taking note of the Secretary-General’s Road Map for Digital Cooperation, launched in June 2020, Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, Recognizing that the right to privacy can enable the enjoyment of other rights, the free development of an individual’s personality and identity and an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy, and noting that the accelerated synchronization of online and offline spaces can affect individuals, including their right to privacy, Noting that algorithmic or automated decision-making processes online can affect the enjoyment of individuals’ rights offline, Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, on the basis of international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies and the impact of surveillance on the enjoyment of the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness, lawfulness, legality, necessity and proportionality in relation to surveillance practices and to consider potential discriminatory effects, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology, and at the same time enhances the capacity of Governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception, hacking and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age can affect all individuals, with particular effects on women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons, as well as persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, Noting further that women and girls experience gender-specific violations and abuses of their right to privacy, both online and offline, as well as violations or abuses that have gender-specific impacts, Recognizing that the promotion and protection of, and respect for, the right to privacy are important to the

protection and promotion of the rights of the child and the elimination of all forms of violence against children, including all violent punishment of children, Urging all States to respect, protect and fulfil the right of children, including children with disabilities and children in vulnerable situations, to express themselves freely and their right to be heard, to ensure that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, that their views are given due weight and that they are included in decision-making processes, in accordance with their evolving capacities or age and maturity, in all matters affecting them, including those relating to relevant aspects of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, while recognizing also the importance of involving children’s organizations and child-led initiatives, Concerned about the occurrence of bullying and cyberbullying in all parts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may be at heightened risk of compromising their health, emotional well-being and education and for a wide range of physical and/or mental health conditions, as well as potential long-term effects on the individual’s ability to realize his or her own potential, Deeply concerned that children disproportionately suffer the consequences of discrimination, exclusion and inequality and that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains negatively affected by the prolonged effects of poverty and inequality, reaffirming that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is one of the greatest global challenges and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, recognizing the impact of poverty beyond the socioeconomic context and the intrinsic interlinkage between poverty eradication and the promotion of sustainable development, and in this regard underlining the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and recognizing that a strong focus is needed on poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all forms of violence and to promote the resilience of children, their families and their communities, Recognizing that girls are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, including sexual violence, and forced labour, which, among other things, would hinder the realization of their rights and efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and the empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and 4/17 effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing further that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, Expressing serious concern that children with disabilities, particularly girls, face stigmatization, discrimination or exclusion and are disproportionately subjected to mental and physical violence and sexual abuse in all settings, Reaffirming that the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States parties to pursue the full implementation of the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through ensuring access to health-care services, the provision of adequate nutritious food and clean drinking water, hygiene and sanitation, and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Reaffirming also the need to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, and recognizing that infectious diseases, including pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, remain a leading cause of death in children under 5, along with pre-term birth and intrapartum-related complications, Recognizing that the risk of maternal mortality is highest for girls under 15 years of age and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among girls under 15 years of age in many countries, Profoundly concerned that children, particularly in early childhood, in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, including persistent drought, natural disasters such as extreme weather events, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, loss of biodiversity and pollution, which further threaten health, food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and in this regard calling for the implementation of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,* Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling the importance of promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrant children, regardless of their migration status, with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration; reaffirming all latest international policy developments and relevant United Nations agreements in this regard; and strengthening international and regional cooperation, within the framework of the United Nations and relevant regional forums, Recognizing that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is one of the greatest global challenges in the history of the United Nations, and noting with deep concern its disproportionately heavy impact, inter alia, on children, and its impact on health and the loss of life, mental health and well-being, as well as the negative impact on global humanitarian needs and the enjoyment of human rights and across all spheres of society, including on livelihoods, food security and nutrition, and education, the exacerbation of poverty and hunger, disruption to economies, trade, societies and environments, and the exacerbation of economic and social inequalities 517 within and among countries, which is reversing hard-won development gains and hampering progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and all its Goals and targets, Deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children, including on their access to essential health-care services, and about the reported surge of sexual and gender-based violence, including domestic violence and violence in digital contexts, during confinement, Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic caused the largest ever mass disruption to education systems across the world, forcing school closures in more than 190 countries and affecting 90 per cent of the world’s students at its peak, with an estimated 7.6 million girls at risk of not returning to school and an estimated 370 million children missing out on free or subsidized school meals, and noting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in schools, and that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and reduce absenteeism, Recognizing also that there is increased reliance on virtual learning, with more than 90 per cent of Governments enacting policies to provide digital or broadcast learning, and that, while recalling Committee on the Rights of the Child general comment No. 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital environment,> meaningful access to digital technologies can support children to realize the full range of their rights, as has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges faced by children in accessing the Internet and digital devices can limit their right to education, and increase inequalities among and within countries, with children living in rural areas and from the poorest households being the most affected, Stressing that new information and communications technologies and applications can create new ways to enhance education and foster learning and teaching on the rights of the child and can be useful tools to promote children’s rights and protection, and in that regard stressing the need to enhance efforts to expand connectivity and digital learning and bridge the digital divide, including the gender digital divide, while protecting children from violence in the digital environment, Deeply concerned that increased unsupervised use of the Internet, inter alia, during the COVID-19 pandemic, has exacerbated children’s exposure to the risk of all forms of violence, including in digital contexts, inter alia, sexual harassment, peer-to-peer sexual harassment and cyberbullying, child sexual exploitation and abuse, child grooming, trafficking in persons, hate speech, stigmatization, racism, xenophobia and discrimination, Reiterating the importance of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda and that a strong focus is needed on combating poverty, deprivation and inequality to prevent and protect children from all violations and abuses and to promote the rights of children, and the importance of promoting education, including early childhood education, 1.

Calls upon States to ensure the enjoyment by all children of all their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights without discrimination of any kind; 9.

among other issues, awareness of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and of the remaining challenges in this regard, Recalling also the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of June 199215 and its resolution 66/288 of 27 July 2012, entitled “The future we want”, and emphasizing the critical importance of water and sanitation within the three dimensions of sustainable development, Noting the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Taking note with appreciation of the organization of the United Nations Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, 2018-2028, in New York from 22 to 24 March 2023, subsequently referred to as the UN 2023 Water Conference, and its preparatory process, including its preceding regional and global preparatory meetings and the 2021 high-level meeting on water, in accordance with modalities resolution 75/212 of 21 December 2020, and calling for, inter alia, accelerating the achievement of the internationally agreed water-related goals and targets, including those contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including Sustainable Development Goal 6, and promote the implementation of the objectives of the water action decade, Affirming the importance of continually improving the availability of high- quality, accessible, timely and reliable disaggregated data on progress related to safe drinking water and sanitation services in households, educational settings, health-care facilities, workplaces and other settings, including public places, as an indispensable means for States to plan for, implement and monitor the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all without discrimination, Welcoming the fact that the number of countries with estimates available for indicator 6.1.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals on safely managed drinking water services has increased from 96 to 138, representing an increase in the proportion of the global population with data available from 34 per cent to 45 per cent, and for indicator 6.1.2 on safely managed sanitation services has increased from 84 to 120 countries, representing an increase in the proportion of the population with data available from 48 per cent to 81 per cent, Welcoming also the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2021 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene on household drinking water, 15 Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, 3—14 June 1992, vol. 1, Resolutions Adopted by the Conference (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.93.1.8 and corrigendum), resolution 1, annex I. 3/9 sanitation and hygiene, '® taking note of the baseline reports and progress updates for the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation in educational settings and in health-care facilities, as well as the expansion of databases to include information on types of facilities used and the level of service received, including accessibility, availability and quality, and estimates on inequalities disaggregated by rural and urban, subnational regional and wealth quintile for an increasing number of countries, and noting the fact that it has an extensive global database and has developed global norms to benchmark progress, including most recently on affordability, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures very often do not fully capture all the dimensions of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Welcoming further the fact that, globally, between 2015 and 2020, according to the Joint Monitoring Programme, the percentage of the population using safely managed drinking water increased from 70 to 74 per cent, and the percentage of the population using safely managed sanitation services increased from 47 to 54 per cent, Deeply concerned that, more than 10 years after the adoption of resolution 64/292, 2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water services, including 1.2 billion people with basic services, 282 million with limited services, 367 million using unimproved sources and 122 million drinking surface water, while 3.6 billion people lack safely managed sanitation, including 1.9 billion people with basic services, 580 million with limited services, 616 million using unimproved facilities and 494 million practising open defecation, Deeply concerned also that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities, and that those disproportionately at risk are women, girls and persons in vulnerable situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, including sexual and reproductive health- care services, and gravely concerned that 2.3 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home, which is urgently needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, Recognizing that hygiene, including hand hygiene, and access to adequate water and sanitation services are essential for preventing the emergence and spread of infectious diseases that can have a negative impact on the enjoyment of all human rights, and highlighting in this regard the importance of urgent universal and equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation, including through enhanced investment, as a crucial aspect of pandemic preparedness and response, Deeply concerned about the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services and its dramatic consequences for the overall health situation in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of conflict and natural disaster, and acknowledging that people living in countries affected by armed conflict and natural disasters and in countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, as well as people living in refugee camps, including in refugee host countries, are more likely to lack access to basic drinking water and to basic sanitation than people living in unaffected countries, while acknowledging the efforts of refugee host countries in improving the situation of people living in refugee camps, Deeply concerned also that achieving universal and equitable access to safe water and sanitation services by 2030 will require a fourfold increase in current rates of progress, 16 World Health Organization and United Nations Children’s Fund, Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 2000-2020: Five Years into the SDGs (Geneva, 2021). 4/9 Deeply concerned further that women and girls often face, especially in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, particular barriers in accessing water and sanitation and hygiene services, as well as menstrual health and hygiene management, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water and of care responsibilities, including those arising from waterborne diseases, in many parts of the world, restricting their time for other activities, such as education and leisure, or, for women, for earning a livelihood, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases hit children the hardest, while noting that child diarrhoea remains a leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s universal and equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation and that, in humanitarian emergencies and crises, including in times of armed conflict or natural disaster, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, Deeply concerned that persons with disabilities, especially children, often lack universal and equitable access to safe and sustainably managed drinking water and sanitation services and face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities that are accessible and appropriate to their needs, which has an impact on their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is particularly concerning in situations of homelessness and humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed by indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilian objects in armed conflict, which may injure personnel and damage civilian infrastructure that is critical to the delivery of essential services to the civilian population, Deeply concerned that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual health and hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information and education thereon, whether in school or out of school, and are excluded and stigmatized, that the enjoyment of their human rights, including the right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, can be negatively affected and that they are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned also that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual health and hygiene management, especially in schools and other educational settings, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and at home, negatively affects gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, including the right to education and the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recognizing the specific hygiene needs of women and girls during menstruation, and that women have specific hygiene needs during pregnancy, childbearing and rearing and throughout the life course, Deeply concerned further that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or, when lacking adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, limiting their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, Deeply concerned that non-existent or inadequate sanitation facilities and serious deficiencies in water management and wastewater treatment can negatively affect water provision and sustainable access to safe drinking water and that, according to the United Nations World Water Development Report 2021, an estimated 80 per cent of the world’s wastewater is released into the environment without treatment, 5/9 Affirming the importance of regional and international cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, with the understanding that it has no bearing on the issues of international water law, including international watercourse law, Expressing concern that climate change increases the frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and recalling the need to accelerate
