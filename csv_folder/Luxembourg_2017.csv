entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted the outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda, recognizing that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, and envisaging a world free of poverty, hunger, disease and want, a world of universal respect for human rights and human dignity that includes equitable and universal access to health-care services and social protection, and where physical, mental and social well-being are assured, Recognizing that the 2030 Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law, and is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the United Nations Millennium Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome, and is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development, Reaffirming that the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda are

founded on the dignity of the human person, and reflecting the principles of equality and non- discrimination, Reaffirming the right of refugees and migrants to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Concerned about the interrelatedness between poverty and the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of

environmental determinants of health, as well as to address holistically a range of barriers arising from inequality and discrimination that impede access to health-care services, Noting with concern that, for millions of people throughout the world, especially for women and girls, the full enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health remains a distant goal, Recognizing that women, youth, children, indigenous persons, older persons, persons with disabilities, persons living with HIV and people of African descent face particular challenges and

conditions or psychosocial disabilities, in particular persons using mental health services, may be subject to, inter alia, widespread discrimination, stigma, prejudice, violence, social exclusion and segregation, unlawful or arbitrary institutionalization, overmedication and treatment practices that fail to respect their autonomy, will and preferences, Deeply concerned also that, despite the impressive reductions in maternal mortality rates achieved since 1990, according to the World Health Organization, in 2015, there were an estimated 303,000 maternal deaths of women and girls, which were largely preventable, and that many more women and girls suffer serious and sometimes lifelong injuries, which have severe consequences for their enjoyment of their human rights and their overall well- being, Deeply concerned further that more than 5,900,000 children under 5 years of age die each year, mostly from preventable and treatable causes, owing to inadequate access or lack of access to integrated and quality maternal, newborn and child health-care services, to early childbearing, and to health determinants, such as safe drinking water and sanitation, safe and adequate food and

lack of access to medicines is a global challenge that affects people not only in developing countries but also in developed countries, even though the disease burden is disproportionately high in developing countries, Noting with concern that approximately 54 per cent of persons living with HIV are in need of treatment, many of whom do not know their HIV status, Concerned at the instances of multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuses that affect the enjoyment of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and recalling the importance that States adopt or strengthen law, policies and practices to eradicate any form of discrimination, stigma, violence and abuse in health-care services, Recognizing that universal health coverage implies that all people have access without discrimination to nationally determined sets of the needed promotive, preventive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative essential health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and essential, safe, affordable, efficacious and quality A/HRC/35/L.18 medicines, vaccines,

segments of the population, Underscoring that the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard

important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Emphasizing also that an open,

inequality, inadequate social and economic conditions, pandemics, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, fetal alcohol syndrome and inherited addictions, non-communicable diseases, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, environmental damage, climate change, natural disasters, armed conflict, foreign occupation, displacement, famine, violence, terrorism, abuse, all

notices and procedures to track stolen, forged identity papers and travel documents, and INTERPOL’s counter-terrorism fora and foreign terrorist fighter programme, Recognizing that relevant information, including information included in INTERPOL databases from Member States, should be shared among national agencies, such that law enforcement, judicial and border security officers can proactively and systematically use that information as a resource, where appropriate and necessary, for investigations, prosecutions and screening at points of entry, Recognizing that a comprehensive approach to the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters requires addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, including by preventing radicalization to terrorism, stemming

to engage with offenders after release from prison to avoid recidivism, in accordance with relevant international law and taking into consideration, where appropriate, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, or “Nelson Mandela Rules”, Noting that some member states may face technical assistance and capacity building challenges when implementing this
