Welcomes the following set of international rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States: 1. States should comply with the Charter of the United Nations and universally recognized norms governing international relations that enshrine, inter alia, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the diversity of history, culture and social systems of all countries. 2. Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of information and communications technologies and to prevent practices relating to such technologies that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security. 3. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security. 4. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability, and reaffirm the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations. 5. States should recognize the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States. 6. States should endeavour to ensure at all levels of the supply chain the security of information and communications technology goods and services, in order to prevent other States from exploiting their dominant position in information and communications technologies, including dominance in resources, critical infrastructures, core technologies, information and communications technology goods and services and information and 3/7 communications networks, to undermine the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services, or to threaten their political, economic and social security. 7. States should reaffirm the rights and responsibilities of all States, in accordance with the relevant norms and rules, regarding legal protection of their information space and critical information infrastructure against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage. 8. States should recognize that the rights of an individual in the offline environment must also be protected in the online environment; and fully respect rights and freedoms in the information space, including the right and freedom to seek, receive and impart information, taking into account the fact that article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* attaches to that right special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals; 9. All States must play the same role in, and carry equal responsibility for, international governance of the Internet, its security, continuity and stability of operation, and its development in a way which promotes the establishment of multilateral, transparent and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms which ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure the stable and secure functioning of the Internet. 10. States must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. However, the indication that an information and communications technology activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the information and communications technology infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. States should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated. In case of information and communications technology incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the information and communications technology environment and the nature and extent of the consequences. 11. States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies. States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies and should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts. 12. States should consider how best to cooperate to exchange information, assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of information and communications technologies and curb the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, separatism or extremism or that inflames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious grounds, and implement other cooperative measures to address such threats. States may need to consider whether new measures need to be developed in this respect. 4/7 13. States, in ensuring the secure use of information and communications technologies, should respect Human Rights Council resolutions 20/8 of 5 July 2012° and 26/13 of 26 June 2014° on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, as well as General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and 69/166 of 18 December 2014 on the right to privacy in the digital age, to guarantee full respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. 14. A State should not conduct or knowingly support information and communications technology activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public. 15. States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from information and communications technology threats, taking into account General Assembly resolution 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, and other relevant resolutions. 16. States should respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another State whose critical infrastructure is subject to malicious acts using information and communications technologies. States should also respond to appropriate requests to mitigate malicious information and communications technology activity aimed at the critical infrastructure of another State emanating from their territory, taking into account due regard for sovereignty. 17. States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of information and communications technology products, and the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services should not be undermined or their political, economic and social security threatened. 18. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious information and communications technology tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions. 19. States should encourage responsible reporting of information and communications technology vulnerabilities and share associated information on available remedies for such vulnerabilities to limit and possibly eliminate potential threats to information and communications technologies and infrastructure dependent on such technologies. 20. States should not conduct or knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams (sometimes known as computer emergency response teams or cybersecurity incident response teams) of another State. A State should not use authorized emergency response teams to engage in malicious international activity. 21. States should encourage the private sector and civil society to play an appropriate role to improve security of and in the use of information and communications technologies, including supply chain security for information and communications technology products and services. States should cooperate with the private sector and the organizations of civil society in the sphere of > See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 53 and corrigendum (A/67/53 and A/67/53/Corr.1), chap.

A. 5/7 implementation of rules of responsible behaviour in information space with regard to their potential role. 22. States should develop confidence-building measures aimed at increasing predictability and reducing the likelihood of misunderstanding and the risk of conflict. Such measures will include, inter alia, voluntary exchange of information regarding national strategies and organizational structures for ensuring a State’s information security, the publication of white papers and exchanges of best practice, wherever practical and advisable. 23. States should assist developing countries in their efforts to enhance capacity-building on information security and to close the digital divide. 24. States should bolster bilateral, regional and international cooperation, promote a prominent role for the United Nations in areas such as encouraging the development of international legal norms for information security, peaceful settlement of international disputes, qualitative improvements in international cooperation in the field of information security; and to enhance coordination among relevant international organizations. 25. States should settle any dispute resulting from the application of the present set of international rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States through peaceful means and refrain from the threat or use of force; 2.

Recalling also General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which it proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, Recalling further the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at the 2014 high-level meeting of the Sanitation and Water for All partnership and in the Ngor Declaration on Sanitation and Hygiene, adopted at the fourth African Conference on Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2015, the Dhaka Declaration, adopted at the sixth South Asian Conference on Sanitation, in 2016, the Lima Declaration, adopted at the fourth Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Sanitation, in 2016, and the Dar es Salaam road map for achieving the Ngor commitments on water security and sanitation in Africa, adopted at the sixth Africa Water Week, in 2016, and noting the Budapest Water Summit 2016 and its recommendations, the call for action of the high-level symposium on the theme “Sustainable Development Goal 6 and targets: ensuring that no one is left behind in access to water and sanitation”, held in Dushanbe in 2016, the seventh South Asian Conference on Sanitation, held in Islamabad in 2018, and the High-level International Conference on the International Decade for Action “Water for Sustainable Development”, held in Dushanbe in 2018, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2017 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation in 2015, an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 844 million people lack a basic water service, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.5 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation and 892 million people still practise open defecation, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow- onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, A/HRC/39/L.11 Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres, and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions, and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes, or practising open defecation, Deeply alarmed that water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the responsibility of States to ensure the respect, promotion and protection of all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and must be treated globally, in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Recalling that the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and to the right to life and human dignity, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds, and with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, income levels or other relevant considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without any prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation A/HRC/39/L.11 entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and takes note with appreciation of his report on the theme of the human rights to water and sanitation of forcibly displaced persons;! 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and _ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals, and urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons at risk have equal access to effective remedies; 6. Notes with concern that, in spite of all efforts, gender inequalities still exist in the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; 7. Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law; (b) To ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for persons at risk and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, gender, age, disability, ethnicity, culture, religion and national or social origin or on any other grounds; (c) To monitor continuously and analyse regularly the status of the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation and to enhance efforts to improve the availability, accessibility, quality and use of water-related data at local, national and regional levels, and to develop disaggregated and gender-responsive indicators and monitoring mechanisms; (d) To promote both women’s leadership and their full, effective and equal participation in decision-making on water and sanitation management, ensure that a gender- based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes, including measures to reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education, to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when ' A/ARC/39/55. A/HRC/39/L.11 accessing sanitation facilities outside of their home or practising open defecation, to protect women’s and girls’ equal access to water and sanitation and to take positive measures to guarantee the availability and accessibility of these rights; (e) To address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by ensuring access to factual information thereon , addressing the negative social norms around the issue and ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender-sensitive facilities, including disposal options for menstrual products; (f) To make efforts to mitigate the disproportionate impact of water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases on children and reduce child mortality, morbidity and stunting by ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; (g) To consult and coordinate with local communities and other stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation; (h) To provide for effective accountability mechanisms to ensure that all water and sanitation service providers, including private sector providers, respect human rights and do not cause or contribute to human rights violations or abuses; 8.

A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 International Conference on Financing for Development and in the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Recognizing that respect for and the protection and fulfilment of the full enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls and the full implementation of all Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda, including Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls and target 3.1 on reducing global maternal mortality, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, and particularly in humanitarian settings, and that a dramatic and sustainable scaling up of quality treatment and health-care services, including high-quality emergency obstetric services and also of the number of trained, competent fistula surgeons and midwives, is needed to significantly reduce maternal and new-born mortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, Recognizing also that humanitarian settings may exacerbate pre-existing patterns and structures of discrimination and inequalities and further undermine access to health care, information and services, housing, water, sanitation, education and employment for women and girls, and that in affected areas access to essential services, such as health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, are disrupted owing to inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional health-care workers, basic medicines and health-care supplies and survivor-centred referral pathways for all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further that, in humanitarian settings, disintegrating judicial systems, gender-based discrimination and discrimination against refugees in host countries, fear of reprisals against their families or themselves, and the stigma associated with sexual and gender-based violence all prevent women and girl survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and those denied access to sexual and reproductive health-care services from reporting sexual violence and seeking justice, accountability and remedies for the violations they have endured, Deeply concerned that women and girls living in humanitarian settings are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of violation of their rights, including through trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, and lack of accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, and lack of access to water and sanitation, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates between countries, but also within countries, and between women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, which creates the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Deeply concerned that in countries affected by humanitarian situations, the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54 compared to | in 180 globally, and that the majority of preventable maternal deaths have occurred in settings of armed conflict, natural disasters and displacement, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, both globally and in humanitarian settings, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Recognizing the need for further disaggregated data on maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and for access to sexual and reproductive health-care services in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, and recognizing the need to bridge the humanitarian- development divide, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and their review conference and outcome documents, and the right to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, good practices and legal frameworks that respect bodily autonomy and guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion in accordance with international human rights law and where not against national law, the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2. Urges States, in accordance with obligations under relevant provisions of international human rights law, including the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, to ensure the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care services, including mental health care and psychosocial services and sexual and reproductive health- care services, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 3. Calls upon States to pay special attention to the particular situation of adolescent girls in humanitarian settings, who may have to assume adult responsibilities and are exposed to higher risks of sexual and gender-based violence, child, early and forced marriage and trafficking, and are likely to be denied education, skills training, safe employment opportunities and access to sexual and reproductive health-care services and information, and to face isolation, discrimination and stigma, mental health issues and risk- taking behaviour; 4. Encourages all stakeholders to consider promoting and using the Inter- Agency Standing Committee’s Guidelines for Integrating Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action, the its Gender Handbook and the Inter-agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings, and to ensure delivery of the Minimum Initial Service Package for Reproductive Health at the onset of humanitarian emergencies, with particular attention to women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and in situations of vulnerability, and to ensure a transition, as soon as possible, towards comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services, information and evidence-based education; 5. Encourages Governments, local authorities, the United Nations system and regional organizations, and invites donors and other assisting countries, to address the vulnerabilities and capacities of women and girls through gender-responsive programming, including with regard to sexual and reproductive health needs and the means to address sexual and gender-based violence and various forms of exploitation during emergencies and in post-disaster environments, and the allocation of resources in their disaster risk reduction, response and recovery efforts in coordination with the Governments of affected countries; 6. Strongly urges States and all parties to armed conflict to take effective measures to prevent and address acts of violence, attacks and threats against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities in armed conflict, including through the development of domestic legal frameworks to ensure respect for their relevant international legal obligations; 7. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,* and encourages all stakeholders to consider the recommendations contained therein; 8. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, including by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data, and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 9. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect women’s bodily autonomy and privacy and the equal right to decide autonomously in matters regarding their own lives and health by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights law and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third-party authorization for health information and health-care services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviours that are discriminatory; 10. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 aimed at preventing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, including those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, including in humanitarian settings, such as by informing women of their rights under relevant international and domestic law, and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 11. Further urges States to ensure accountability and gender-sensitive, prompt and effective remedies for the violation of the rights of women and girls in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings by including transparent forms of monitoring, review and oversight of humanitarian programmes and policies, including the monitoring of inequities; 12. Calls upon States to support gender equality and women’s rights and the rights of the child, including within families, through awareness-raising initiatives, including in schools and in displaced and refugee camps and settlements, especially education and public awareness-raising, including through the media and online, the incorporation of curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, and ensuring universal access to evidence-based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child; 13. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a comprehensive human rights-based approach to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of accessible, affordable and appropriate health-care services for all, and of information and education, lack of access to medicine and medical equipment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, underdevelopment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, especially adolescent girls, and to ensure access to accountability for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, including effective reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence, such as the prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence committed in humanitarian settings, while ensuring the meaningful and effective participation of women and girls in the relevant processes; 14. Calls upon all relevant actors, including Governments, regional organizations, relevant United Nations agencies, national human rights institutions, entities providing humanitarian assistance and civil society organizations to, within their respective mandates, strengthen their efforts to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings when designing, implementing and reviewing policies and evaluating programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, while ensuring the meaningful participation of women and girls in all decisions that affect them; 15. Calls upon States to ensure a more holistic and coordinated approach to the humanitarian-development nexus, and places the individual woman and girl at the centre of humanitarian preparedness and response, and recognizes the need to overcome siloed approaches and fragmented programming; 16. Also calls upon States to ensure the effective and meaningful participation of women and girls, including through civil society and feminist networks and women’s rights organizations, in identifying and determining needs, priorities for funding and service, processes for access and delivery, and crisis response, in recognition of their agency; 17. Urges States to strengthen their statistical capacity and to promote reliable transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls in affected populations, including host populations; A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 18. Invites States to consider the systematic integration of sexual and reproductive health as an integral part of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health into the mandates of investigative bodies established by the Human Rights Council, including commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, and to address human rights violations suffered by women in humanitarian settings; 19. Requests the High Commissioner to prepare, from within existing resources, in consultation with States, United Nations agencies and all other relevant stakeholders, a follow-up report on good practices and challenges to respecting, protecting and fulfilling all human rights in the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the utilization of the technical guidance by States and other relevant actors, including the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and the World Health Organization, and to present it to the Human Rights Council at its forty-fifth session; 20.

Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security. 1.2. States must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. However, the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. Accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated. In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences. 1.3. States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs. States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using ICTs and should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts. 1.4.

A State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public. 1.7. States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from ICT threats, taking into account General Assembly resolution 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, and other relevant resolutions. 1.8. States should respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another State whose critical infrastructure is subject to malicious ICT acts. States should also respond to appropriate requests to mitigate malicious ICT activity aimed at the critical infrastructure of another State emanating from their territory, taking into account due regard for sovereignty. 1.9. States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of ICT products. 1.10. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions. 1.11. States should encourage responsible reporting of ICT vulnerabilities and share associated information on available remedies for such vulnerabilities to limit and possibly eliminate potential threats to ICTs and ICT-dependent infrastructure. 1.12.

the cooperation framework between the World Health Organization and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and that between the Office of the High Commissioner and the United Nations Population Fund, and also of the articles on the protection of persons in the event of disasters, adopted by the International Law Commission,” Recognizing the importance of strengthening coordination between all relevant United Nations agencies, entities providing humanitarian assistance and civil society organizations in accordance with their respective mandates, and the need for States to ensure fully respect for and the protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in reducing preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that international humanitarian law and international human rights law are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and recognizing that persons affected by disasters are entitled to the respect for and protection of their human rights in accordance with international law, Reaffirming that States have an obligation to take steps to achieve the full realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, including in humanitarian settings, Recognizing that a human rights-based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is underpinned by the principles of, inter alia, accountability, participation, transparency, empowerment, _ sustainability, non- discrimination and international cooperation, Stressing that reducing maternal mortality and morbidity with full respect of States’ human rights obligations and commitments will require efforts across the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International ' Leading the Realization of Human Rights to Health and through Health, report of the High-level Working Group on the Health and Human Rights of Women, Children and Adolescents (Geneva, World Health Organization, 2017). A/HRC/39/L.13 Conference on Financing for Development and in the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Recognizing that respect for and the protection and fulfilment of the full enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls and the full implementation of all Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda, including Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls and target 3.1 on reducing global maternal mortality, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violations of the right to sexual and reproductive health, including inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, and particularly in humanitarian settings, and that a dramatic and sustainable scaling up of quality treatment and health-care services, including high-quality emergency obstetric services and also of the number of trained, competent fistula surgeons and midwives, is needed to significantly reduce maternal and new-born mortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, Recognizing also that humanitarian settings may exacerbate pre-existing patterns and structures of discrimination and inequalities and further undermine access to health care, information and services, housing, water, sanitation, education and employment for women and girls, and that in affected areas access to essential services, such as health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, are disrupted owing to inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional health-care workers, basic medicines and health-care supplies and survivor-centred referral pathways for all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further that, in humanitarian settings, disintegrating judicial systems, discrimination on the basis of gender and against refugee populations in host countries, fear of reprisals against their families or themselves, and the stigma associated with sexual and gender-based violence all prevent women and girl survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and those denied access to sexual and reproductive health-care services from reporting sexual violence and seeking justice, accountability and remedies for the violations they have endured, Deeply concerned that women and girls living in humanitarian settings are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of violation of their rights, including through trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, and lack of accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, and lack of access to water and sanitation, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, A/HRC/39/L.13 Reaffirming that the human rights of women and girls include their right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for their dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates between countries, but also within countries, and between women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, which creates the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Deeply concerned that in countries designated as fragile States, the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54 compared to 1 in 180 globally, and that the majority of preventable maternal deaths have occurred in settings of conflict, natural disasters and displacement, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, both globally and in humanitarian settings, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Recognizing the need for further disaggregated data on maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and for access to sexual and reproductive health-care services in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, and recognizing the need to bridge the humanitarian- development divide, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and their review conference and outcome documents, and the right of everyone to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, good practices and legal frameworks that respect the right to bodily autonomy and guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health, services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion in accordance with international human rights law and standards and where not against national law, the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2. Urges States, in accordance with obligations under relevant provisions of international human rights law, including the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the right to sexual and reproductive health, to ensure the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health-care services, including mental health care and psychosocial services and sexual and reproductive health- care services, free of coercion, discrimination and violence; A/HRC/39/L.13 3. Calls upon States to pay special attention to the particular situation of adolescent girls in humanitarian settings, who may have to assume adult responsibilities and are exposed to higher risks of sexual and gender-based violence, child, early and forced marriage and trafficking, and are likely to be denied education, skills training, safe employment opportunities and access to sexual and reproductive health-care services and information, and to face isolation, discrimination and stigma, mental health issues and risk- taking behaviour; 4. Encourages all stakeholders to use the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s Guidelines for Integrating Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action, the its Gender Handbook and the Inter-agency Field Manual on Reproductive Health in Humanitarian Settings, and to ensure delivery of the Minimum Initial Service Package for Reproductive Health at the onset of humanitarian emergencies, with particular attention to women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and in situations of vulnerability, and to ensure a transition, as soon as possible, towards comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services, information and education; 5. Encourages Governments, local authorities, the United Nations system and regional organizations, and invites donors and other assisting countries, to address the vulnerabilities and capacities of women and girls through gender-responsive programming, including with regard to sexual and reproductive health needs and the means to address sexual and gender-based violence and various forms of exploitation during emergencies and in post-disaster environments, and the allocation of resources in their disaster risk reduction, response and recovery efforts in coordination with the Governments of affected countries; 6. Strongly urges States and all parties to armed conflict to take effective measures to prevent and address acts of violence, attacks and threats against medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties, their means of transport and equipment, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities in armed conflict, including through the development of domestic legal frameworks to ensure respect for their relevant international legal obligations; 7. Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the follow-up on the application of the technical guidance on the application of a human rights-based approach to the implementation of policies and programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity,* and encourages States and stakeholders to consider the adoption of the recommendations contained therein; 8. Requests States and other relevant actors to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity initiatives in their development partnerships and international assistance and cooperation arrangements, including by strengthening technical cooperation to address maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the transfer of expertise, technology and scientific data, and exchanging good practices with developing countries, while honouring existing commitments, and to integrate a human rights-based perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that discrimination against women and girls has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 9. Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect women’s and girls’ right to bodily autonomy and privacy by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights standards and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third- party authorization for health information and services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviours that are discriminatory; 10. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing violations of the right to sexual and reproductive health, including A/HRC/39/L.13 those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, including in humanitarian settings, such as by informing women and girls of their rights under relevant international and domestic law, and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 11. Further urges States to ensure accountability and gender-sensitive, prompt and effective remedies for the violation of the rights of women and girls in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings by including transparent forms of monitoring, review and oversight of humanitarian programmes and policies, including the monitoring of inequities; 12. Calls upon States to support gender equality and women’s and girls’ rights, including within families, through awareness-raising initiatives, including in schools and in displaced and refugee camps and settlements, especially education and public awareness- raising, including through the media and online, the incorporation of curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, and ensuring universal access to evidence- based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child; 13. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a comprehensive human rights-based approach to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of accessible, affordable and appropriate health-care services for all, and of information and education, lack of access to medicine, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, especially adolescent girls, and to ensure access to accountability for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, including effective reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence, such as the prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence committed in humanitarian settings, while ensuring the meaningful and effective participation of women and girls in the relevant processes; 14. Calls upon all relevant actors, including Governments, regional organizations, relevant United Nations agencies, national human rights institutions, entities providing humanitarian assistance and civil society organizations to, within their respective mandates, strengthen their efforts to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings when designing, implementing and reviewing policies and evaluating programmes to reduce preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, while ensuring the meaningful participation of women and girls in all decisions that affect them; 15. Calls upon States to ensure a more holistic and coordinated approach to the humanitarian-development nexus, and places the individual woman and girl at the centre of humanitarian preparedness and response, and recognizes the need to overcome siloed approaches and fragmented programming; 16. Also calls upon States to ensure the effective and meaningful participation of women and girls, including through civil society and feminist networks and women’s rights organizations, in identifying and determining needs, priorities for funding and service, processes for access and delivery, and crisis response, in recognition of their agency; 17. Urges States to strengthen their statistical capacity and to promote reliable transparent, collaborative and disaggregated data collection on the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of sexual and reproductive health-care services for all women and girls in affected populations, including host populations; 18. Invites States to consider the systematic integration of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights into the mandates of investigative bodies established by the Human Rights Council, including commissions of inquiry and fact- finding missions, and to promote an integrated agenda that recognizes and is responsive to the continuum of human rights violations suffered by women and girls in crisis settings and A/HRC/39/L.13 their consequences, including the displacement of populations and living conditions in humanitarian contexts and settings; 19. Requests the High Commissioner to prepare, from within existing resources, in consultation with States, United Nations agencies and all other relevant stakeholders, a follow-up report on good practices and challenges in the application of a human rights- based approach to the elimination of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, including through the utilization of the technical guidance by States and other relevant actors, including the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and the World Health Organization, and to present it to the Human Rights Council at its forty-fifth session; 20.
