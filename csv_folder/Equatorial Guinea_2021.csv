The International Solar Alliance, an initiative of India and France, was founded in 2015 at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Paris. In the Paris declaration regarding the launch of the Alliance, the shared vision of bringing clean, affordable and renewable energy within the reach of all was expounded. It set for the members the mission to mobilize more than $1 trillion in investments for the mass deployment of affordable solar energy by 2030. The then Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, attended the ceremony in Paris, on 30 November 2015, at which the Alliance was launched. Establishment of the International Solar Alliance 2. The international steering committee of the International Solar Alliance, established at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, deliberated on and finalized the framework agreement on the establishment of the Alliance and the institutional framework of the Alliance and its secretariat. The agreement was opened for signature at the twenty-second Conference of the Parties, in 2016, and entered into force on 6 December 2017 in accordance with article XIII of the agreement, with the Alliance acquiring the status of a treaty-based international organization. Subsequently, the framework agreement was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. 3. The founding conference of the International Solar Alliance, held on 11 March 2018, saw the adoption of the “Delhi Solar Agenda”, in which the parties to the framework agreement reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 4. The framework agreement provides that the seat of the International Solar Alliance shall be in India. The Alliance signed a headquarters agreement with the Government of India on 26 March 2018 in which the international legal personality of the Alliance was recognized, consistent with article X of the framework agreement. Article X also provides that, in the territory of each member State and subject to its national laws and the conclusion of a separate agreement, if necessary, the Alliance may enjoy the privileges and immunities necessary for the independent discharge of its functions and programmes. Subsequently, after transferring all assets and liabilities to the first Assembly of the Alliance in October 2018, the international steering committee of the Alliance ceased to exist pursuant to article XIII of the framework agreement. Institutional and organizational structure Assembly 5. The Assembly of the International Solar Alliance, which was established under article IV of the framework agreement and includes representatives from each member State, is the chief decision-making body of the Alliance. The Assembly takes all necessary decisions on the implementation of the agreement and on coordinated action to be taken to achieve its objectives. It is chaired by the President and co-chaired by the Co-President, both elected by the Assembly for a term of two years. The President and the Co-President are supported by eight Vice-Presidents, two each from the four geographical regions of the Alliance — Africa, Asia and the Pacific, 5/20 A/76/192 Europe and others, and Latin America and the Caribbean — selected on the basis of seniority in terms of the submission of the instrument of ratifications to the depositary of the Alliance, that is, the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India. 6. The first Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held on 3 October 2018. The Assembly adopted a number of significant decisions, including on the programme of work and budget, the approval of the provisional rules of procedure of the Assembly, the appointment of the Director General, a model agreement on privileges and immunities between the Alliance and individual member States, and the approval of the manual of regulations for the Alliance. Subsequent meetings of the Assembly were held in 2019 and 2020, with a special assembly convened in February 2021 to appoint the successor to the then Director General of the Alliance. Currently, India and France are the Co-Presidents of the Assembly. Standing committee 7. The standing committee, established by the Assembly, comprises the President, the Co-President, eight Vice-Presidents, and up to nine additional members who may be appointed in accordance with rule 79 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The standing committee is responsible and accountable to the Assembly and carries out the powers and functions entrusted to it under the rules of procedure, as well as those functions delegated to it by the Assembly. The committee is mandated, inter alia, to consider the programme of work and budget of the International Solar Alliance, to substantiate the approved programme of work, to take stock of Alliance programmes, to consider and recommend to the Assembly proposals with substantial financial implications for the Alliance, and to advise the secretariat on any emergent issues, upon request. Regional committees 8. To enhance regional cooperation and collaboration, a regional committee is established by the Assembly, under its rules of procedure, for each of the four regions of the International Solar Alliance. Each regional committee comprises the two Vice- Presidents selected from the region and all other Alliance members from the region. The regional committees are responsible and accountable to the Assembly. The regional committees serve as the forum for the regional coordination of views on matters related to the Assembly. The regional committees are mandated, inter alia, to support the harmonization and aggregation of demand, to review the scope of solar applications for members and to assess the aggregate effect of the Alliance programmes in the region. Secretariat 9. The secretariat is established pursuant to article V of the framework agreement. The members, Assembly and committees of the International Solar Alliance are supported by the secretariat to assist them in their collective work under the agreement and the rules of procedure of the Assembly. The secretariat comprises the Director General, who is the Chief Executive Officer, and other staff, as required. The standing committee of the Alliance has approved the provision of 12 international posts and 20 national posts at the Alliance secretariat, for which recruitment is in process. 10. The secretariat coordinates all programmes, activities and initiatives entrusted to it by the Assembly through the national focal points, appointed by each member State in accordance with article II of the framework agreement. 11. Article VIII of the framework agreement provides that partner organization status may be granted to organizations that have the potential to help the International 6/20 A/76/192 Solar Alliance to achieve its objectives. It is specifically stated therein that the United Nations, including its organs, will be the strategic partner of the Alliance. At its first meeting on 3 October 2018, the Assembly requested the secretariat to establish institutional links between the Alliance and the United Nations and authorized the secretariat to apply for observer status for the Alliance in the General Assembly of the United Nations. Membership 12. The International Solar Alliance was established as an alliance of solar-resource rich countries, with its membership open to the 121 States Members of the United Nations that lie fully or partially between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. However, on 3 October 2018, the first Assembly of the Alliance adopted a resolution proposed by India to amend the framework agreement of the Alliance to expand the scope of its membership to all Member States. The amendment entered into force on 8 January 2021 and was registered with the United Nations Secretariat in accordance with General Assembly regulations to give effect to article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. As of July 2021, 79 States members of the Alliance and 19 other States are expected to ratify the agreement. 13. The current membership of the International Solar Alliance covers a significant proportion of the global population. Moreover, a large proportion of the membership is comprised of the least developed countries and small island developing States that stand to benefit significantly from the programmes and activities of the Alliance. As of July 2021, the following States from the four regions of the Alliance are members: Africa 1. Algeria 2. Benin 18. Guinea 19. Madagascar 20. Malawi 3. Botswana 21. Mali 4. Burkina Faso 22.

Under the Paris declaration of the International Solar Alliance, the Alliance is mandated to promote collaboration and cooperation among its member States in order to lower the cost of solar energy and facilitate the massive and needs-based deployment of solar energy through innovative policies, projects, programmes, capacity-building measures and financial instruments. As an action-oriented organization, the Alliance was established to support and enhance the efforts of the global community aimed at meeting the collective ambition of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, with a particular focus on Goals 7 and 13. 15. The International Solar Alliance lends its support to its member States across the three critical areas of energy access, energy security and energy transition. The strategic interventions of the Alliance are aimed at reducing the cost of technology and finance and at facilitating the mobilization of low-cost investment in the solar energy sector. 16. The International Solar Alliance plays the crucial roles of accelerator, enabler, incubator and facilitator of the deployment of clean and affordable solar energy at scale to address those key critical issues. As an accelerator, the Alliance supports the creation of economies of scale in the solar energy sector across its membership and the reduction of transaction costs to lower the cost of deploying solar energy in member States. As an enabler, it supports capacity-building interventions to create a well-qualified pool of human resources talent to drive solar energy programmes in member States. 17. In addition, the International Solar Alliance supports the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory ecosystem across its membership through knowledge creation and exchange. As an incubator, the Alliance supports, through its network of partnerships, the development and adoption of innovative financing and risk mitigation modalities across its membership to attract low-cost private and institutional finance. As a facilitator, it supports member States with developing viable solar energy road maps and integrating these with their overarching energy and climate objectives. Further, the Alliance facilitates the mobilization of finance for solar energy projects. 18. To achieve the vision and mission of the International Solar Alliance, the following guiding principles for members of the Alliance are set down in article II of its framework agreement: (a) Members take coordinated actions through programmes and activities launched on a voluntary basis, aimed at better harmonizing and aggregating demand 9/20 A/76/192 for, inter alia, solar finance, solar technologies, innovation, research and development, and capacity-building; (b) In this endeavour, members cooperate closely and strive to establish mutually beneficial relationships with relevant organizations, public and private stakeholders, and non-member States; (c) For those solar applications for which it seeks the benefits of collective action under the Alliance and on the basis of a common analytical mapping of solar applications, each member shares and updates relevant information regarding its needs and objectives, domestic measures and initiatives taken or intended to be taken in order to achieve these objectives, and obstacles along the value chain and dissemination process. The secretariat maintains a database of these assessments in order to highlight the potential for cooperation. VI. Funding 19. The International Solar Alliance was conceived as a voluntary alliance of sovereign countries with no membership fee. Article VI of its framework agreement outlines the sources of funding, which include voluntary contributions from member States, partner organizations including regional economic integration organizations and the United Nations and its agencies, and the private sector as potential sources of funding for the Alliance. The revenue generated from specific activities, approved by the Assembly, are additional sources of finance for the Alliance. 20. India, the host country of the International Solar Alliance, made an initial contribution of $16 million to the Alliance corpus fund, in addition to its contribution to the recurring expenditure of the Alliance for five years from 2016 to 2021. 21. Myanmar and the Comoros have made voluntary contributions to the corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance. France, the co-founder of the Alliance, has provided initial support through the provision of two experts to the Alliance secretariat, as well as initial support of €50,000 for the programme to enable solar technical centres in member States. In addition, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Australia have made financial and/or in- kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 22. The partner organizations of the International Solar Alliance, such as the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the European Union, the French Development Agency, the Climate Investment Funds and the World Resources Institute, have also made financial and in-kind contributions to various Alliance programmes, activities and initiatives. 23. Asof March 2021, the total corpus fund of the International Solar Alliance stood at $33.5 million, with contributions amounting to $17.5 million from the corporate sector. VII. Programme and projects 24. The International Solar Alliance has launched seven thematic programmes since its inception that are dedicated to the deployment of cross-cutting solar energy applications across multiple sectors, including agriculture, health and electricity. The programmes of the Alliance are intended to provide a holistic solution to the triple challenge of energy access, energy security and energy transition through a blend of small-scale off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications and large 10/20 A/76/192 utility-scale projects. The following are the seven thematic programmes of the Alliance: (a) Scaling solar applications for agricultural use. This programme is focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications, including solar water pumping systems, solar energy-based drinking water applications and water, sanitation and hygiene interventions; solar home lighting and other off-grid lighting solutions; and solar energy-based cold storage; (b) Affordable finance at scale. This is an overarching programme dedicated to identifying and promoting innovative financing modalities and risk mitigation instruments to lower the cost of finance in the solar energy sector; (c) Scaling solar mini-grids. This programme is dedicated to promoting the electrification of regions that have yet to establish grid connectivity; (d) Scaling solar rooftop. This programme is dedicated to the promotion of solar rooftop applications for industrial, commercial and government consumers; (e) Scaling solar e-mobility and storage. This programme is dedicated to promoting e-mobility solutions based on solar energy, solar-powered charging infrastructure and energy storage solutions at scale; (f) Solar park. This programme complements other programmes that are focused on off-grid and decentralized renewable energy applications to meet the challenge of energy access. It focuses on deploying large utility-scale ground- mounted solar projects to support member States in integrating solar energy into their energy mix at the speed and scale necessary to meet the challenges of energy security and energy transition; (g) Solar heating and cooling. This programme is dedicated to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the rapidly increasing heating and cooling requirements across the membership of the Alliance. The programme encompasses the industrial, commercial, agricultural and residential sectors. 25. In addition to the thematic programmes, the International Solar Alliance has launched specific sectoral interventions, such as the “ISA CARES” initiative, which is aimed at solarizing the health sector to address the challenge of energy access, with a particular focus on developing and least developed countries. The aim of the initiative is to provide not only solar energy-based electricity but additional infrastructure such as solar-powered vaccine cold chains and mobile health clinics. VIII. Capacity-building programmes 26. The International Solar Alliance has been equally receptive to the capacity- building needs of its member States to develop and manage solar assets, including those to be deployed under its thematic programmes and other initiatives. The Alliance is working to support its members in developing capacity to deploy scaled- up solar applications through the development of a network of technical training, entrepreneurship, research and innovation centres in order to harmonize and deliver training programmes using a network of training facilities that would be recognized across the member States. 27. The Solar Technology Applications and Resources Centre network will facilitate the exchange of best practices and promote knowledge dissemination and capacity - building with regard to solar energy, supporting stakeholders across the full deployment process (including technicians, master trainers, project developers, engineers and policymakers). In addition, the network is aimed at supporting the 11/20 A/76/192 standardization of solar technology applications and supporting collaborative research and development, including with the private sector. IX. Projects in individual countries 28. The International Solar Alliance has launched an initiative, approved at its third Assembly, to facilitate, through technical and financial support, solar energy demonstration projects across 47 least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States of the Alliance — 26 countries from the African region, 12 from the Asia and the Pacific region and 9 from the Latin American and the Caribbean region. 29. The initiative is aimed at deploying projects for developing resilience in the agriculture and health sectors. The selection of projects would be member-driven. As of February 2021, project proposals have been received from 16 member States among the least developed countries and small island developing States, while discussions with the remaining least developed countries and small island developing States that are member States are under way. 30. The goal of the International Solar Alliance is to facilitate affordable access for member States to funding for solar projects. To this end, through a partnership between the Alliance, the World Bank and the French Development Agency, the solar risk mitigation initiative was launched at the twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Although the cost of solar energy is constantly falling, its deployment remains slow in certain emerging markets, notably in Africa, where a belief is held in the private sector that the funding of solar projects entails too many risks. The solar risk mitigation initiative is aimed at reversing this trend. It involves the creation of the following: (a) A technical assistance programme for developing sustainable solar projects (support for planning, resource mapping and electrical sector reform) and the solar deployment guidelines, which help countries to identify clear and stable solar goals; (b) A new procurement platform, which will be launched online and will be used to facilitate and collect solar project bids; (c) Hedging instruments to protect against the financial risks inherent in renewable energy production projects, in order to guarantee the solvency of the suppliers. 31. The International Solar Alliance, in partnership with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, is also facilitating a pilot project for solar-powered food and vaccine cold chain technologies in Nigeria. The project is aimed at demonstrating innovative and low-cost technologies that are run on self-sustaining financial models. 32. The International Solar Alliance has signed an agreement with the African Development Bank to harness solar energy. The basic objective of the joint declaration, as mentioned in the agreement, was to develop a road map to mobilize financing for the promotion of solar energy in prospective African International Solar Alliance member States. 12/20 A/76/192 X. Observer status for the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly 33. The primary objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. Accelerating the transition towards a low-carbon economy and boosting investments in infrastructure for renewable energy, notably solar power, is therefore critical to realizing the goals of the Agreement. 34. Accordingly, solar energy is an important constituent of renewable energy as an alternative source owing to its wider availability as well as its affordability. The International Solar Alliance is being established at a time when there is a growing need for renewable energy as an alternative source of energy at both the global and regional levels. 35. The International Solar Alliance is a treaty-based international organization dedicated to contributing to the successful outcome of the United Nations sustainable development process and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals. The primary goal of the Alliance is to lower the cost of finance and spur investments across the solar supply chain, including in manufacturing, project development and storage. 36. The aims, objectives and activities of the International Solar Alliance as set out in the framework agreement and its activities as reflected in the programmes are relevant to the work of the General Assembly in the area of renewable energy. The Alliance is striving to promote the massive deployment of solar energy globally and thereby provide energy security and promote sustainable development in its member States. 37. The promotion of solar energy in the context of the health infrastructure in developing countries supports the achievement of Goal 3, aimed at ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages. 38. The various activities of the International Solar Alliance advance many of the objectives of the Paris Agreement and thus contribute to addressing the challenges posed by global warming. 39. The International Solar Alliance plays an important role internationally in supporting the implementation of several United Nations conventions on climate change and the global climate change agenda in general. The participation of the Alliance in major international meetings involving these issues is often critical for the Alliance to carry out its work and mandate. In addition, the Alliance has the wide- ranging resources and expertise needed to make a significant contribution to all such meetings, dialogues and decisions by helping to shape the global policy dialogue and supporting its implementation on solar energy. 40. Since the entry into force of the amendment to the framework agreement on 8 January 2021, the membership of the International Solar Alliance has been universalized and is open to all States Members of the United Nations. It is expected to expand quickly, giving a boost to the efforts of the Alliance to promote the use of solar energy globally. 41. The framework agreement of the International Solar Alliance explicitly designates the United Nations, including its organs, as a strategic partner of the Alliance. Observer status will greatly enhance the ability of the Alliance to achieve its goals. The Alliance will be able to follow the deliberations in the General Assembly closely, to cooperate with United Nations organs, agencies and programmes in the implementation of its programmes and activities and to benefit 13/20 A/76/192 from the United Nations through its network of field offices, experience in programme cooperation with Governments, and extensive resources in the development process. 42. We believe that the International Solar Alliance can contribute positively to the fields of sustainable development, renewable energy and climate change and can enhance the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. 43. Granting observer status to the International Solar Alliance in the General Assembly would enable the Alliance to provide targeted inputs to current and future United Nations processes on the basis of grass-root level experiences from its country programmes, its research and public-private cooperation activities and its global knowledge-sharing activities. The Alliance is also taking a big step towards addressing issues such as technology transfer, the storage of solar energy, and even financial assistance to member States, along with project layout and project planning measures. 44. Cooperation between the United Nations and the International Solar Alliance has the potential to support progress towards building national capacities to reduce poverty and exclusion, enhancing sustainable human development and achieving nationally and internationally agreed development goals. The initiatives of the United Nations and the Alliance can serve as a powerful tool for addressing the challenges faced by developing countries and accelerating progress towards the Goals, and specifically Goal 7: to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. 45. The International Solar Alliance, through its efforts to bring about just and equitable energy solutions through the deployment of solar energy, is expected to usher in a new era of green energy diplomacy. The granting of observer status to the Alliance in the General Assembly would help to provide for regular and well-defined cooperation between the Alliance and the United Nations that would benefit global clean energy growth and sustainable development. 14/20 A/76/192 Annex I1 Framework Agreement on the establishment of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) We, the Parties to this Agreement, Recalling the Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance of 30"" November 2015 and the shared ambition to undertake joint efforts required to reduce the cost of finance and the cost of technology, mobilize more than US $ 1000 billion of investments needed by 2030 for massive deployment of solar energy, and pave the way for future technologies adapted to the needs, Recognizing that solar energy provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to bring prosperity, energy security and sustainable development to their peoples, Acknowledging the specific and common obstacles that still stand in the way of rapid and massive scale-up of solar energy in these countries, Affirming that these obstacles can be addressed if solar resource rich countries act in a coordinated manner, with strong political impulse and resolve, and that better harmonizing and aggregating the demand for inter alia solar finance, technologies, innovation or capacity building, across countries, will provide a strong lever to lower costs, increase quality, and bring reliable and affordable solar energy within the reach of all, United in their desire to establish an effective mechanism of coordination and decision-making among them, Have agreed as follows: Article I Objective Parties hereby establish an International Solar Alliance (hereinafter referred to as the ISA), through which they will collectively address key common challenges to the scaling up of solar energy in line with their needs.

pandemic has had a significant impact on the education, health and nutrition of the rural poor, especially women and girls, who are often left behind in the implementation of social protection programmes aimed at alleviating rural poverty, and recognizing also that, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, rural and agricultural development aid included only a small fraction of projects aimed at transforming negative gender roles and empowering women and girls in rural areas, Deeply concerned that the extreme situation of girls in child-headed households persists and that poverty, armed conflict, climate-related and other hazards, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, including the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, and other humanitarian emergencies increase the incidence of child-headed households, forcing children, particularly girls living in rural areas, to undertake adult responsibilities, including being the main household earner and caring for younger siblings, and making them particularly vulnerable to poverty, violence, including physical and sexual violence, and discrimination, which seriously inhibits their development and violates and/or impairs the full

including those in rural areas, which are necessary to inform appropriate policy responses by Member States and the United Nations system, Concerned that, in sub-Saharan Africa, five out of six new HIV infections among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years are among girls, that adolescent girls and young women aged 15 to 24 years account for 24 per cent of HIV infections despite representing 10 per cent of the population, and that AIDS is the leading cause of death for adolescent girls and women aged between 15 and 49 years, and further noting with concern that rural/urban disaggregated data relating to HIV incidence are scarce, with little information on girls below the age of 15 years, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the unpaid care and domestic work related to the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this also negatively affects girls living in rural areas by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that millions of girls are engaged in child labour and its worst forms, including those who have been victims of trafficking in persons and affected by armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies, that children without nationality or birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and child labour and that many children face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with unpaid care and domestic work, which deprive them of their childhood and hamper the full enjoyment of their right to education and opportunities for decent employment in the future, and noting in this regard the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute girls’ disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, Recognizing that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence and forced labour, which, among other things, would hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Sustainable 3/13 Development Goals, particularly those Goals that are relevant to gender equality and the empowerment of girls, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including by partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing also that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Sustainable Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing further that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through girls’ organizations with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, including those that disproportionately affect girls, such as child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence, trafficking in persons and the use of information and communications technology and social media to perpetrate violence against women and girls, and, in addition, about the corresponding impunity and lack of accountability, and that violence against women and girls is underrecognized and underreported, particularly at the community level, which reflects discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also by the increased violence against women and girls in the context of confinement measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and emphasizing the need for strengthened prevention and response mechanisms, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, including girls with disabilities and those living in rural and remote areas, bearing in mind their specific needs, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriage, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child, particularly those living in rural areas, to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and childbirth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their physical and mental health and well-being, their employment opportunities and their quality of life and 4/13 that of their children, and violates and/or impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also that young women and girls are particularly affected by water scarcity, unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene, and concerned furthermore that girls, especially those in rural areas, are often excluded from full and continued participation in school owing to their burden of water procurement at home, a lack of water and sanitation facilities in schools and inadequate access to effective feminine hygiene products, Emphasizing that increased and equal access to quality education for young people, especially adolescent girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, as well as health care, hygiene and sanitation, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases and infections, in particular HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, Recognizing that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from education, and recognizing also that among gendered barriers to girls’ equal enjoyment of their right to education are child marriage, early pregnancy, sexual and gender-based violence, the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and gender stereotypes and negative social norms that lead families and communities to place less value on girls’ education when compared with that of boys, Deeply concerned that school-related violence against girls, including sexual violence and harassment on the way to and from and at school, such as violence perpetrated by teachers, continues to deter girls’ education and, in many cases, the transition to and completion of secondary education, and that these risks may influence parents’ decision to allow girls to attend school, Noting that school meals and take-home rations attract and retain children in schools, and recognizing that school feeding is an incentive to enhance enrolment and reduce absenteeism, especially for girls living in rural areas, Stressing the need for the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, the specialized agencies, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of enhanced financial resources and technical assistance, targeted comprehensive programmes that address the needs and priorities of the girl child, 1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General; ' 2. Stresses the need for the full and urgent implementation of the rights of the child, including the girl child, as provided under international human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocols thereto as a matter of priority; 3. Urges all States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138),!° and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182),% of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 4. Urges States to develop or review relevant programmes that promote gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and equal access to basic social services, such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, birth 18 A/76/204. 19 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1015, No. 14862. 20 Ibid., vol. 2133, No. 37245. 5/13 registration, health care, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the major causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream a gender perspective into all development policies and programmes, including those specific to the girl child; 5.

Calls upon States and other relevant actors to implement cross-cutting and integrated policies and programmes that tackle all forms of discrimination that are often compounded, against girls in rural areas and that respond to the multidimensional aspects of adolescent girls’ lives, while taking into account the views of girls living in rural areas, in particular with regard to COVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts; 7. Urges States and other relevant actors to strengthen multisectoral child protection systems in rural areas to prevent violence and ensure holistic support for girls who are at greater risk of experiencing, or who have experienced, violence, exploitation and abuse, while paying special attention to girls with disabilities and other marginalized girls living in rural and remote areas; 8. Recognizes that ensuring equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality education requires transformations in education systems, mainstreaming a gender perspective into educational programmes, infrastructure development and teacher training, and in this regard calls upon States to invest in quality education, including through adequate financing, to ensure that all girls, including those who are marginalized or in vulnerable situations, enjoy their right to education; 9. Calls upon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to take steps to bridge the digital divide, including the gender digital divide, as part of the efforts to ensure the empowerment of all women and girls, particularly those living in rural areas; 10. Emphasizes the importance of the right of everyone to education and the continuation of learning, including girls, acknowledging that during the COVID-19 pandemic adolescent girls are at particular risk of dropping out and not returning to school even after the pandemic is over, thereby increasing their vulnerability to poverty, child, early and forced marriage and early pregnancy, calls upon Member States to ensure that girls are protected and supported in returning to school once it is deemed safe to do so, and in this regard calls upon Member States and other relevant stakeholders to take the appropriate measures in order to ensure the availability of learning materials and remote learning platforms during the pandemic, and to bridge the digital divide in order to provide distance learning opportunities, inter alia, Internet, television and radio teaching alternatives, especially in developing countries; 11. Notes the role of the United Nations in supporting national Governments in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development?!' and in realizing girls’ right to education; 12. Calls upon States to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children, including those living in rural areas, and ensuring that all children have equal access to quality education, as well as making secondary and tertiary education available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive 2l Resolution 70/1. 6/13 introduction of free secondary education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, ensuring physical access to education, including by increasing financial incentives to families, improving the safety of girls on the way to and from school, ensuring that all schools are accessible, safe, secure and free from violence and providing hygienic, separate and adequate sanitation facilities, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families and children who become heads of households; 13. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive formal education, special initiatives for keeping girls in school through post-primary education, including those who are already married or pregnant, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurship training for young women and to tackle gender stereotypes, in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment and decent work, and equal pay for equal work or work of equal value; 14. Encourages States to adopt, as appropriate, and implement inclusive policies and programmes to promote girls’ education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, including information and communications technology, throughout their education, by, inter alia, expanding the scope of education and training opportunities ranging from basic digital fluency to advanced technical skills, recognizing that girls who develop such skills may enjoy more academic success and higher-paying jobs in the future, and recognizing also that girls and women have an equally important role to play in these arenas as men and boys; 15. Calls upon States, with the support, where appropriate, of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, to develop policies and programmes, giving priority to formal, informal and non-formal education programmes, including scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality and women’s empowerment, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to, inter alia, enable them to protect themselves from HIV infection and other risks; 16. Urges States to acknowledge the different needs of girls and boys during their childhood and adolescence and, as appropriate, to make adapted investments that are consistent with and responsive to their changing needs, in particular ensuring that girls have access to clean water, including safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and feminine hygiene products as well as private toilet facilities, including feminine hygiene product disposal facilities, in educational institutions and other public spaces, which will improve their health and access to education and increase their safety; 17. Calls upon States, in collaboration with civil society and other relevant actors, to promote educational and health practices in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural, and girls are not stigmatized on this basis, recognizing that girls’ attendance at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls; 7/13 18. Urges States to strengthen efforts to urgently eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and girls, and calls upon all States, the United Nations system and civil society to take measures to address the obstacles that continue to affect the achievement of the goals set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action,? as contained in paragraph 33 of the further actions and initiatives,? including reviewing remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls in order to modify or abolish them and, where appropriate, strengthening national mechanisms to implement inclusive policies and programmes for the girl child and, in some cases, to enhance coordination among responsible institutions for the realization of the human rights of girls, including access to justice, fighting impunity for perpetrators of and ensuring the availability of appropriate penalties for crimes of sexual violence committed against the girl child, and to mobilize all necessary resources and support in order to achieve those goals; 19. Also urges States to ensure that the applicable conventions of the International Labour Organization relating to the employment of girls and boys are respected and effectively enforced and that girls who are employed have equal access to decent work and equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, are protected from economic and sexual exploitation, discrimination, sexual harassment, violence and abuse in the workplace, are aware of their rights and have access to formal and non-formal education, skills development and technical and vocational training, and urges States to develop gender-sensitive measures, including national action plans, where appropriate, to eliminate child labour and its worst forms, commercial sexual exploitation, hazardous forms of child labour, trafficking and slavery-like practices, including forced and bonded labour, and the recruitment or use of children in armed conflict in violation of applicable international law, and to recognize that girls, including those living in rural areas, face greater risks in this regard; 20.
