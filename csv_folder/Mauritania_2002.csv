extrajudicial killing, the policy of assassinations, closures, collective punishments, the persistence in establishing settlements, arbitrary detentions, the besieging of Palestinian towns and villages, the shelling of Palestinian residential districts from warplanes, tanks and Israeli battleships, the conducting of incursions into towns and camps and the killing of men, women and children

occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967, Convinced that the basis of negotiations and of achieving a just and lasting peace should be Security Council

Further strongly condemns the war launched by the Israeli army against Palestinian towns and camps, which has resulted so far in the death of hundreds of Palestinian civilians, including women and children; 5. Strongly condemns the practice of “liquidation” or “extrajudicial executions” carried out by the Israeli army against Palestinians, a practice which not only constitutes a violation of human rights norms, a flagrant violation of article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the rule of law, but which is also damaging for the relationship between the parties and therefore constitutes an obstacle to peace, and urges the Government of Israel to respect international law and to cease this practice immediately; 6. Also strongly condemns the establishment of Israeli settlements and other related activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, such as the construction of new settlements and the expansion of already existing ones, the expropriation of lands, the biased administration of water resources and the construction of bypass roads, all of which are not only violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law, especially article 49 of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (the Fourth Geneva Convention) and Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions which categorized such violations as war crimes, but are also major obstacles to peace, urges the Government of Israel to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions as well as the resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights relative to the Israeli settlements, and affirms that the dismantling of the Israeli settlements constitutes an essential factor for achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region; 7.

Fourth Geneva Convention in this respect; 17. Affirms anew that the demolition by the Israeli occupying forces of over 1,200 houses owned by Palestinian families is a grave violation of articles 33 and 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and that levelling farmlands, uprooting trees and destroying the infrastructure of Palestinian society constitute grave violations of the provisions of international humanitarian law and a form of collective punishment against the Palestinian people; 18. Reaffirms that the Fourth Geneva Convention is applicable to the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, and considers any change in the geographical, demographic and institutional status of the city of East Jerusalem from its status prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void; 19.

as the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, adopted by the General Assembly at its fiftieth and forty-ninth sessions, respectively, Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the General Assembly on 8 September 2000 at its fifty-fifth session, Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights (A/CONF.157/23), Noting all previous General Assembly resolutions on the issue of terrorism, including resolutions 46/51 of 9 December 1991, 48/122 of 20 December 1993, 49/185 of 23 December 1994, 50/186 of 22 December 1995, 52/133 of 12 December 1997 and 56/160 of 19 December 2001, as well as its own resolutions 2000/30 of 20 April 2000 and 2001/37 of 23 April 2001, Recalling General Assembly resolutions 54/164 of 17 December 1999 and 54/110 of 9 December 1999, in which it decided that the Ad Hoc Committee established by Assembly resolution 51/

conventions dealing with international terrorism, including considering the elaboration of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, and should address the question of convening a high-level conference under the auspices of the United Nations to formulate a joint organized response of the international community to terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, Reaffirming the need for the implementation of General Assembly resolution 54/109 of 9 December 1999, in which the Assembly adopted the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, Taking note of the importance of General Assembly resolution 55/158 of 12 December 2000, in which the Assembly stressed the need to strengthen further international cooperation between States and between international organizations and agencies, regional organizations and arrangements and the United Nations in order to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed, in accordance with the principles of the Charter, international law and relevant international conventions, Noting with great concern the growing connection between terrorist groups and other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and drugs at the national and international levels, as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes, such as murder, extortion, kidnapping, assault, the taking of hostages and robbery, Alarmed in particular at the possibility that the terrorist groups may exploit new technologies to facilitate acts of terrorism which may cause massive damage, including huge loss of human life, Mindful that the Security Council adopted resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001, requiring States to adopt counter-terrorism measures, and resolution 1377 (2001) of 12 November 2001, by which it adopted a declaration on the global effort to combat terrorism, Convinced that terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomever committed, can never be justified in any instance, including as a means to promote and protect human rights, Bearing in mind that the most essential and basic human right is the right to life, Bearing in mind also that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations creates an environment that destroys the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear and want, and makes it difficult for States to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, Bearing in mind further that terrorism in many cases poses a severe challenge to democracy, civil society and the rule of law, Recalling in this regard the horrific events of 11 September 2001 in the United States of America which led to the loss of the lives of several thousand civilians, Reiterating that all States have an obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure effective implementation of their obligations under international humanitarian law, Profoundly deploring the large number of civilians killed, massacred and maimed by terrorists in indiscriminate and random acts of violence and terror, which cannot be justified under any circumstances, Emphasizing the need to intensify the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations at the national level and to enhance effective international cooperation in combating terrorism in conformity with international law, including relevant State obligations under international human rights and international humanitarian law, and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in this respect, Recognizing the need to improve international cooperation on criminal matters and national measures so as to address impunity, which can contribute to the continued occurrence of terrorism, Emphasizing that States shall deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit terrorist acts, or provide safe havens, Reaffirming that all measures to counter terrorism must be in strict conformity with international law, including international human rights standards and obligations, Seriously concerned at the gross violations of human rights perpetrated by terrorist groups, Deciding further to promote the growing consciousness of the international community of the negative effects of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations on the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and on the establishment of the rule of law and democratic freedoms as enshrined in the Charter and the International Covenants on Human Rights, 1. Reiterates its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, regardless of their motivation, in all their forms and manifestations, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed, as acts aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening the territorial integrity and security of States, destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, undermining pluralistic civil society and the rule of law and having adverse consequences for the economic and social development of the State; 2.

Urges all relevant human rights mechanisms and procedures, as appropriate, to address the consequences of the acts, methods and practices of terrorist groups in their forthcoming reports to the Commission; 9. Invites the Office of the High Commissioner to respond to requests from interested Governments for assistance and advice on ensuring full compliance with international human rights standards and obligations when undertaking measures to combat terrorism; 10. Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General (A/56/190), and invites him to continue to seek the views of Member States on the implications of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations for the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and on how the needs and concerns of victims of terrorism might be addressed, including through the possible establishment of a voluntary fund for the victims of terrorism, as well as on ways and means to rehabilitate the victims of terrorism and to reintegrate them into society, with a view to incorporating his findings in his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly; 11. Endorses the decision of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights requesting the Secretary-General to give the Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission all the assistance necessary, in order to hold consultations with the competent services and bodies of the United Nations system to complement her essential research and to collect all the needed and up-to-date information and data for the preparation of her second progress report; 12.
