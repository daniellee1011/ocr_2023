measures and schemes to combat overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the critical need for cooperation with developing States to build their capacity in this regard, taking note of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop a legally binding instrument on minimum standards for port State measures, Concerned that marine pollution from all sources, including vessels and, in particular, land-based sources, constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, Welcoming the support by the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its twenty-seventh session, held from 5 to 9 March 2007, for a proposal that the Food and Agriculture Organization should undertake a scoping study to identify the key issues on climate change and

States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to meet their obligations and exercise their rights under international instruments, in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources, Recognizing the need for appropriate measures to minimize by-catch, waste, discards, loss of fishing gear and other factors, which adversely affect fish stocks and may also have undesirable effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities, Recognizing also the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into fisheries conservation and management, and more generally the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many

extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and A/62/L.24 fisheries, and the relevance of the 1999 Food and Agriculture Organization International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks in providing guidance on the development of such measures, Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant regional and subregional fisheries Management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, while noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking, that only a small number of countries have implemented the 1999 Food and Agriculture Organization International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries, Expressing concern that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, although the incidence of this practice has continued to be low in most regions of the world’s oceans and seas, Emphasizing that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, Expressing concern over reports of continued losses of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality in fishing operations, particularly longline fishing, and other activities, while recognizing considerable efforts to reduce by-catch in longline fishing by States and through various regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General,” in particular its useful role in gathering and disseminating information on or relating to the sustainable development of the world’s living marine resources,
