Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7.

The Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States was created in 2009 as an international intergovernmental organization with the overarching aim of promoting comprehensive cooperation among its four founding member States (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey). 2. According to the first two statutory documents of the Cooperation Council, the Nakhchivan Agreement of 3 October 2009 and the Istanbul Declaration of 16 September 2010, States members of the Cooperation Council embrace the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, along with other universally recognized principles of international law. Established norms related to the maintenance of peace and security and the development of good-neighbourly relations lay the foundation for cooperation to be developed under the Cooperation Council. 3. The Cooperation Council builds upon the common political will that has evolved through the Summits of the Heads of the Turkic-speaking Countries that have been convened since 1992. Ten such Summits have been held to date, the most recent of which was the Istanbul Summit of 16 September 2010, at which the Cooperation Council was promulgated and its priorities were mapped out. With the establishment of the Cooperation Council as a permanent body, the Summits are renamed Summits of the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States. II. Principles and objectives 4. The Preamble of the Nakhchivan Agreement reaffirms the common will of the States members of the Cooperation Council to adhere to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and encapsulates the objectives of the Cooperation Council as further deepening the comprehensive cooperation among Turkic-speaking States and making joint contributions to peace and stability in the region and the world. Member States have stated their commitment to the basic principles of democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance. Cooperation within the framework of the Cooperation Council is based in particular on the solidarity stemming from the common history, culture, identity and language of Turkic-speaking peoples. 5. Article 1 of the Nakhchivan Agreement sets out the main purposes and tasks of the organization as follows: (a) Strengthening mutual confidence among the parties; (b) Maintaining peace in the region and beyond; (c) Promoting common positions on foreign policy issues; (d) Coordinating actions to combat international terrorism, separatism, extremism and transborder crimes; (e) Promoting effective regional and bilateral cooperation in all areas of common interest; A/66/141 (f) Creating favourable conditions for trade and investment; (g) Aiming for comprehensive and balanced economic growth, and social and cultural development; (h) Discussing questions related to ensuring the rule of law, good governance and the protection of human rights; (i) Expanding interaction in the fields of science, technology, education and culture; (Gj) Encouraging interaction among the mass media and_ wider communication; (k) Promoting the exchange of legal information and enhancing legal cooperation. 6. Within this broad mandate, the organization functions essentially as a permanent mechanism whereby member States come together to discuss issues of common concern and carry out projects in all spheres of mutual benefit. According to the Istanbul Declaration, the areas of cooperation under the Cooperation Council framework are identified as: foreign policy coordination; trade and economic development; industry; agriculture; energy; transport; communications; banking and insurance; education; culture; scientific research; climate change; environmental protection; tourism; humanitarian contacts; non-governmental organizations; and combating the illicit trafficking of drugs, weapons and radioactive materials, all acts of terrorism, illegal migration and transborder organized crime. 7. In its programme of work for the near future, the Cooperation Council will focus on the theme of economic cooperation. It is in the process of finalizing its secondary statutory documents and establishing a Turkic business council and a Turkic academy. Other earmarked projects include the setting-up of a Turkic scientific research fund, a Turkic inter-university union and a joint court of arbitration. II. Structure 8. The Nakhchivan Agreement defines the following as the principal organs of the Cooperation Council: the Council of Heads of State, the Council of Foreign Ministers, the Senior Officials Committee, the Council of Elders of Turkic-speaking States and the General Secretariat. The rules of procedure also envisage a Chairman-in-Office, serving on a rotating basis. The Council of Heads of State is to meet once a year to review progress and define priorities for the Cooperation Council. The Council of Foreign Ministers is the principal decision-making body of the organization. The Council of Elders serves as an advisory body of eminent personalities. The General Secretariat is entrusted with secretarial functions, employing international civil servants from Cooperation Council member States. 9. The Nakhchivan Agreement also refers, in the context of the Cooperation Council process, to related bodies that perform their functions in accordance with their basic instruments: the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic-speaking Countries and the International Organization of Turkic Culture. These bodies are to support the work of the Cooperation Council within their specific fields of cooperation. A/66/141 IV. Relations with other organizations 10. The Cooperation Council has already engaged in interaction with other regional intergovernmental organizations. Priority is given to organizations of which all Cooperation Council countries are members. As a result of consultations with the Economic Cooperation Organization, it was agreed that practical cooperation was to be started forthwith and that the Economic Cooperation Organization would finalize procedures to grant observer status to the Cooperation Council as soon as possible. Cooperation on a similar basis with the Organization of the Islamic Conference is currently under consideration. Observer status in the General Assembly 11. As an intergovernmental organization dedicated to strengthening peace and stability, enhancing dialogue, promoting cooperation and disclosing the potential for common development among its member States, the Cooperation Council fully adheres to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. By promoting deeper relations and solidarity among Turkic-speaking countries, it serves as a new regional instrument for enriching international cooperation in the Central Asian and Caucasian regions. 12. Given the clear complementarity of their goals, granting of observer status in the General Assembly to the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States would initiate a mutually beneficial institutional dialogue between the two organizations. It would bring about coherence of efforts and open avenues for future cooperation in specific areas. Furthermore, obtaining observer status would greatly assist the Cooperation Council in its endeavours to foster regional initiatives among its members aimed at integration.

Chaired by the Mayor of Istanbul, United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) is the world organization of local and regional authorities. With members in 140 countries, it represents the interests of this group before the international community and promotes exchange and innovation among its members at the same time as fostering solidarity and development cooperation (see www.cities- localgovernments.org). General situation 2. Local governments have a long history of cooperation with the United Nations, and United Cities and Local Governments and its founding organizations have been in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council since 1947. 3. Although this has ensured local government participation in United Nations meetings and summits, it is insufficient in two respects: (a) Locally elected representatives are classified as non-governmental organizations, which is clearly not the case; (b) It does not provide a direct link with the elected representatives of the General Assembly, the principal policymaking body of the United Nations. Specific achievements 4. Through years of advocacy and lobbying, local governments and their associations have also achieved special status within specific United Nations agencies and processes: (a) Local authorities are identified as one of nine “major groups” in Agenda 21; (b) Local government representatives have a special relationship with the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and, through rule 64 of the Rules of Procedure of the Governing Council, have distinct rights to participate as observers in the UN-Habitat Governing Council; (c) In 2000, the United Nations Advisory Committee of Local Authorities was established, advising the UN-Habitat Executive Director; (d) United Cities and Local Governments is a member of the Group of Friends of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations; (e) United Cities and Local Governments represents local authorities in the Advisory Group of the Development Cooperation Forum led by the Under- Secretary-General of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat; A/66/192 (f) United Cities and Local Governments is an observer of the Working Party on Aid Effectiveness of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is in charge of the follow-up to the Paris Agenda; (g) Local governments have been explicitly acknowledged in the following Summit processes: Beijing +10, the Millennium +5 Summit and the World Water Forum; (h) Subnational governments (including local authorities) are recognized as specific stakeholders in international climate change negotiations since the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Cancun, Mexico. 5. United Cities and Local Governments has reached agreements or memorandums of understanding with most of the United Nations agencies throughout the years. United Cities and Local Governments ambitions: observer status in the General Assembly of the United Nations 6. United Cities and Local Governments and its members would like to be acknowledged by the United Nations system in its totality as representing a sphere of government and as clearly differentiated from other stakeholders such as civil society, the private sector or non-governmental organizations. 7. Permanent observers have the right to speak at General Assembly meetings, participate in procedural votes and sponsor and sign resolutions, but not to vote on resolutions and other substantive matters. 8. There is a distinction between State and non-State observers. The non-State observers are the international organizations and other entities. 9. Non-State entities that enjoy observer status are the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the International Criminal Court, the International Olympic Committee, and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The precedent for United Cities and Local Governments: case of the Inter-Parliamentary Union 10. The Inter-Parliamentary Union has observer status in the General Assembly as a representative of elected authorities since 19 November 2002. 11. United Cities and Local Governments is asserting that, as with the Inter- Parliamentary Union in General Assembly resolution 57/32, United Cities and Local Governments also enjoys a “unique status” as a world organization of local authorities, and the organization is convinced that it is in the interest of the United Nations to promote cooperation between the United Nations and local authorities in the era of urbanization. Proof of that is the list of relations already established, as mentioned above.

States and between States and other actors in order to strengthen the capacity of States to address migration and development opportunities and challenges more effectively, and taking note with appreciation of the generous offer of Mauritius to assume the presidency of the Global Forum for 2012, Recognizing the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving societies and their communities of origin, as well as the need to identify appropriate means of maximizing development benefits and responding to the challenges which migration poses to countries of origin, transit and destination, especially in the light of the impact of the financial and economic crisis, and committing to ensuring dignified, humane treatment with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation, Emphasizing the global character of the migratory phenomenon, the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this regard,

of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, Aware that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to circumvent restrictive immigration policies, migrants become more vulnerable

Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 do so from hunger-related illness, and that, as estimated by the Food and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the International Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development, Porto Alegre, Brazil, 7-10 March 2006 (C 2006/REP), appendix G. A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the number of people who are undernourished is about 925 million worldwide, and that an additional 1 billion people are suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences on the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries; 5. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7.

Recognizes the advances reached through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 11. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development are essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 12. Recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an A/C.3/66/L.38/Rev.1 increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets, and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 13. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 1° 14.

Notes the need to further examine various concepts such as, inter alia, “food sovereignty” and their relation with food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 17. Requests all States and private actors, as well as_ international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 18. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 12 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the Conference of FAO, Thirty-first Session, Rome, 2-13 November 2001 (C 2001/REP), appendix D.

Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in this regard, and invites once again all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security’ and the United Nations Millennium Declaration;* 24. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 25. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 26. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 27.

A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 Reaffirming the importance of gender mainstreaming across the United Nations system, including in relation to the girl child, Recognizing that chronic poverty remains the single biggest obstacle to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate it, and noting that the burden of the global financial and economic crisis, the energy crisis, the food crisis and the continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those depending on income from the informal sector, and particularly by women and girls, Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing further that progress has been made in the passage of national legislation that affirms the equality of girls and boys and that corresponding measures have not been taken to effectively implement such legislation, and recognizing the continuing existence of discrimination against women and girls throughout the world and that addressing this situation will require additional efforts to strengthen policy implementation, including through international cooperation, Recognizing that the empowerment of and investment in girls which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes, and active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms reinforcing the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls, is under- recognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded because of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition and physical and mental health care, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful traditional practices, such as female infanticide, child and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Deeply concerned that child and forced marriages expose young married girls to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often lead to early childbearing and increase the risk of disability, stillbirth and maternal death, and reduce their opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and violate and impair the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls, Deeply concerned also that early pregnancy and early childbearing and limited access to sexual reproductive health care, including in the area of skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care, cause high prevalences of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and childbirth which often lead to death, particularly for young women and girls, Recognizing that progress towards ending child and forced marriages can have a positive impact on indicators related to girls’ education, maternal health and child health, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child and forced marriages are still underreported and recognizing that this requires further attention, Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation by 2010, set out in the document entitled “A world fit for children”, remains unmet, Deeply concerned further that, in situations of poverty, war and armed conflict, girl children are among those most affected and furthermore become the victims of sexual violence, abuse and exploitation and sexually transmitted infections and diseases, including HIV and AIDS, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Emphasizing that increased access to education for young people, especially girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases, in particular HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases, Recognizing that early childbearing continues to be an impediment to the improvement of the educational and social status of girls in all parts of the world and that, overall, child and forced marriages and early motherhood can severely curtail their educational opportunities and are likely to have a long-term, adverse impact on their employment opportunities and on their and their children’s quality of life, Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and can be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, A/C.3/66/L.24/Rev.1 poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and limitation or denial of their human rights, Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination, including in respect of their access to education and employment, and the importance of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this regard, Noting with concern that in some parts of the world, men outnumber women as a result, in part, of harmful attitudes and practices, such as female genital mutilation, son preference, which results in female infanticide and prenatal sex selection, early marriage, including child marriage, violence against women, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and discrimination against girls in food allocation and in other practices related to health and well-being, with the result that fewer girls than boys survive into adulthood, Deeply concerned that the phenomenon of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, is becoming a serious social problem, Deeply concerned also that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, erosion of the extended family, exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase of child-headed households, Recognizing that women and girls bear the disproportionate burden of caring for and supporting those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this impacts negatively on girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, 1. Stresses the need for full and urgent implementation of the rights of the girl child as provided to her under human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,’ the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? and the Optional Protocols thereto‘ as a matter of priority; 2. Urges all States that have not yet signed and ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182) of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so; 3. Urges all Governments and the United Nations system to strengthen efforts bilaterally and with international organizations and private sector donors in order to achieve the goals of the World Education Forum, ‘® in particular that of eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, which have not been fully met, and to implement the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative as a means of reaching this goal, and calls for the implementation of and reaffirms the commitments contained in the Education for All goals and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to gender and education; 4. Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not 18 See United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Final Report of the World Education Forum, Dakar, Senegal, 26-28 April 2000 (Paris, 2000).
