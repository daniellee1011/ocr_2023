At the same meeting, on a proposal by the Chair, the SBSTA authorized the Rapporteur, with the assistance of the secretariat, to complete the report on the session, under the guidance of the Chair. 109. Also at the 5™ meeting, the Executive Secretary informed the SBSTA that the decisions and conclusions adopted at the twenty-second session would require resources of about USD 130,000, which are additional to the requirements for the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities included in decision 16/CP.9. She noted that this additional requirement would come at a time when there were still unfunded activities of the order of USD 6.8 million for the biennium 2004-2005 and when the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process was almost depleted. 110. The Executive Secretary also informed the SBSTA that an initial estimate of the possible elements for the provisional agenda of the SBSTA at its twenty-third session (December 2005) showed that there could be as many as 12 items. In the light of the limited time available to the SBSTA at its twenty-third session and anticipating the many pressures delegations would face during COP 11 and COP/MOFP 1, she called for some flexibility in organizing the work of the session. For instance, as some items on the provisional agenda, although important in their own right, may not require specific action at the twenty-third session, they may not warrant the same amount of time as other items. %> Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania supported the statement by the European Community and its member States. %% Adopted as FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.5. XII. Closure of the session 111. Before closing the session, the Chair thanked delegates, the chairs of contact groups and facilitators of informal consultations for their contributions.

Research needs relating to the Convention... 31 GE.05-62850 FCCC/SBSTA/2005/4/Add.1 Page 2 Draft decision -/CP.11 Issues relating to adjustments under Article S, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol The Conference of the Parties, Recalling its decisions 21/CP.7 and 20/CP.9, Having considered the relevant recommendations of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice regarding the completion of the technical guidance on adjustments, 1. Decides to incorporate the technical guidance on methodologies for adjustment under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol, contained below in the annex to this decision, into the",N/A,N/A,"2. Recommends that the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, at its first session, adopt decision -/CMP.1 (Issues relating to adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) below, to replace decision -/CMP.1 (Technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 20/CP.9. "" FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.3. ANNEX Technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol I. Objective 1. The objective of this technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol' is: To provide for adjusted estimates that fully meet the requirements of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7;? (a) To ensure that adjustments are applied consistently,” comparably and transparently, taking into account the time frames provided in the guidelines for review under Article 8, and that, as far as possible, similar methods are used for similar problems across all inventories subject to adjustments under Article 8. (b) II. General approach 2. This technical guidance establishes general and specific procedures and methods for use by expert review teams to calculate adjustments. These procedures and methods are supplemented by inventory review resources listed in appendix I to this technical guidance, which will also facilitate consistency in calculation of adjustments by expert review teams. A. Procedures 3. The calculation and application of adjustments shall follow paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7. 4. Adjustments shall be applied, taking into account section II.B below, only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) including supplementary inventory data on Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC Guidelines) as elaborated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry* (hereinafter referred to collectively as the IPCC good practice guidance), and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). 5. Expert review teams shall, under their collective responsibility, calculate, document and recommend adjustments in accordance with the provisions for the review of annual inventories under ! All articles referred to in this technical guidance are those of the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol are hereinafter referred to as adjustments. ? In this context, consistency means that the application of adjustments should be consistent across Parties and by all expert review teams. Article 8 and this technical guidance. A compilation of the provisions relevant to the timing and reporting of adjustments from these guidelines is included in appendix II to this technical guidance. 6. The expert review team should collectively decide on the methodological approach for calculation of any adjustment, including relevant components of the adjustment method (such as data sources, drivers’ and clusters® used). 7. Expert review teams should apply the appropriate adjustment method, selected from table 1, in a simple manner, given the limited time available for the calculation of adjustments according to the provisions for the review of annual inventories in the guidelines for review under Article 8 (see paragraph 3 of appendix II). 8. Expert review teams should apply this technical guidance in a consistent and comparable manner and, as far as possible, use similar methods for similar problems across all inventories reviewed under Article 8, taking into account the provisions for obtaining conservative estimates, as described in paragraphs 51 and 52 below. 9. To enhance consistency in the application of adjustments for any given Party, the same adjustment method should be used, whenever possible, in cases where the same inventory problem was adjusted in an earlier year (e.g. for the base year or for an earlier year of the commitment period). This provision applies to both the basic adjustment method,” and the main components used in the calculation of the adjustment, as appropriate, such as the source of international data, drivers, clusters and any other inventory parameter used. 10. Any adjustments to estimates of emissions and removals for purposes of establishing the assigned amount under Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, will only be applied during the initial review under Article 8. 11. Adjustments should be applied only for individual inventory years, specifically the base year or the latest year of the commitment period under review, and not for an entire time series or group of years, except for cases described in paragraphs 12 and 13 (b)—(c) below. 12. Adjustments should not be retroactively applied for any year preceding the inventory year subject to review, except in cases where recalculated estimates for previous commitment period years and/or instances relating to paragraph 13 (c) below were submitted by the Party together with the inventory information of the inventory year subject to review. Where the Party submits recalculated estimates for commitment period years prior to the inventory year subject to review, adjustments may be applied retroactively for those estimates that have not yet been reviewed, if the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. 13. For estimates of emissions and removals resulting from activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, adjustments may be applied to an individual year or for a group of years, as follows: For activities for which the Party has chosen to account annually, any adjustments should be applied during the annual review for the latest submitted inventory; (a) > For the purpose of this technical guidance, driver refers to indicative data other than activity data or other inventory parameters used in the calculation of emission or removal estimates, that are correlated with emissions or removals, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, associated production data, wells drilled, GDP per capita. The criteria for selecting drivers for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 40. ® For the purpose of this technical guidance, cluster refers to inventory-related data from a group of countries. The criteria for selecting clusters for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 39. 7 For the purpose of this technical guidance, basic adjustment methods are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section I11.D below. For activities for which the Party has chosen to account for the entire commitment period, any adjustments should be considered and applied for any individual year or for any group of years of the commitment period, as necessary, only during the annual review for the final year of the commitment period. Adjustments shall not be considered or applied during any annual review prior to that for the final year of the commitment period; (b) For cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation under Article 3, paragraph 4, any adjustment to the emissions or removals in the base year resulting from these activities should be considered and applied according to the choice made by a Party regarding the periodicity of accounting of these activities (e.g. annually or at the end of the commitment period). In the case that the Party has chosen to account annually for these activities and submits recalculated estimates, adjustments may be applied retroactively for the base year, provided these recalculated estimates have not yet been subject to review and the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. (c) 14. The selection of data and other components required for an adjustment method should take into account the time series for any such component. 15. Even if some aspects of a particular case are not fully covered by this technical guidance, the experts calculating the adjustment shall adhere to paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) and, as closely as possible, to this technical guidance. B. Applicability of adjustments 16. In considering the need for an adjustment, expert review teams should adhere to standard inventory review approaches, which also include assessment of the time series for a given estimate. 17. If the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of emissions in the base year, or an overestimation of emissions in a year of the commitment period, the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied, if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate with a value for the base year that is higher than the original estimate submitted by the Party or a value for a year of the commitment period that is lower than the original estimate. 18. Similarly, if the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of removals resulting from any activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, in a year of the commitment period, or an overestimation of removals in the base year for any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4 (cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation), the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate that is less conservative than the original estimate submitted by the Party. 19. An adjustment procedure should be initiated if the information provided by the Party is not sufficiently transparent, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 4 above. 20. If the expert review team identifies a deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance that is caused by the allocation of estimates to a wrong category or activity under Article 3, paragraph 3 or 4, adjustments should not be applied in the following cases:* ¥ In these cases, reallocation is recommended to the Party as part of the review of annual inventories under Article 8. If reallocation to the correct source category does not affect total emissions from sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol (a) If the reallocation does not affect the accounting of emissions and/or removals from any individual activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4. (b) 21. If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. II1. Methods and conservativeness 22. In general, expert review teams shall calculate each adjustment at the level at which the problem is identified, e.g. the IPCC category level or for the specific component in question. If the problem is limited to only one IPCC category, only the estimate for that source or sink should be adjusted. Similarly, if only one component of a given estimate is problematic (such as inconsistent, incorrect or misapplied emission factors or other inventory parameters, or activity data), the review team should replace only that component in calculating the adjusted estimate. For land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCEF) estimates, consideration should be given to the spatial disaggregation of estimates, where relevant and applicable. 23. If the necessary input data or parameters are not available at the IPCC category level at which the problem is identified, or the problem involves more than one component of an emission or removal estimation method used by the Party, or the complexity of the methodology used does not allow replacing only the problematic component in question, more aggregate data should be used as the basis for the adjustment. However, expert review teams should make every effort to make the adjustment at the levels at which the problems were identified, in order to avoid making data that do not qualify for an adjustment subject to the adjustment. A. Choice of methods 24, If an emission or removal estimate needs to be adjusted,’ the expert review team should choose one of the basic adjustment methods in this technical guidance for the calculation of an estimate for purposes of adjustment. 25. In choosing the basic adjustment method and the input data that are appropriate for a specific adjustment case, expert review teams should, in general, follow the methods listed in priority order in table 1, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated in the sector-specific elements included in chapter IV. If the requirements for the highest priority adjustment method according to the table are not available, the next preferred adjustment method should be used. 26. If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the [IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two years’ estimates are missing, a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method. 27. If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency, and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the cause ? For example, if an emission or removal estimate is missing, if the estimation method used by the Party was not in conformity with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, or if there is a problem with more than one component (emission factor, activity data or other parameter) of the estimation method used by the Party. of the potential deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance (such as inappropriate activity data, emission factors or methods), expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1. Table 1. Basic adjustment methods to obtain an emission/removal estimate (in order of priority) Basic adjustment method Requirements/applicability 1 Default IPCC tier 1 Obtain activity data, emission factors and other estimation parameters following the prioritizations indicated in paragraphs 33 and 34 below 2 Extrapolation of emissions or Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in removals question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates is available 2 Extrapolation of emissions or removals Extrapolation/interpolation of emissions or removals based on a driver Correlation of emissions or removals between source/sink categories or gases within an Y Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates and a corresponding driver are available Emission or removal estimate for the gas/source/sink category that is correlated to the emissions or removals that need adjustment 4 Correlation of emissions or removals between source/sink categories or gases within an 5 Average emission or removal rate Driver for the country in question and emission or removal from a cluster of countries based rate per driver for a cluster of countries on a driver Note: The methods in this table are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section III.D below. Further details on the basic adjustment methods listed in this table are given in section III.C below. 28. In the exceptional case where none of the basic adjustment methods listed in table 1 is suitable for a given adjustment case, expert review teams may use other adjustment methods. If adjustment methods other than those included in this technical guidance are applied, expert review teams should report the reason for not using any of the basic adjustment methods of this technical guidance and should justify why they consider the method chosen as appropriate. B. Choice of data and other components 29. In choosing any input data for calculating an adjustment, expert review teams should give, as appropriate, preference to the national data available in the respective Party’s inventory submission or made available by the Party before or during the review, provided that these data were not the cause for the adjustment. 30. Expert review teams should not conduct time-consuming searches for national data that have not been made available to the review team by the Party, or generate new country-specific data. 31. If national data as indicated in paragraph 29 above are not available or are not deemed suitable for the respective adjustment case, expert review teams should select data from the recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix L. 32. The international data sources to be included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should meet most of the following criteria: The organizations that make the data available are recognized intergovernmental organizations (e.g. United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Energy Agency (IEA)) (a) The data are regularly updated, maintained and disseminated (b) The data are originally generated by the countries themselves (national statistics) (©) The data are widely applicable to Annex I Parties (d) The data are easily accessible by the secretariat and expert review teams (e.g. through Internet or CD-ROM)), in a timely manner and at reasonable cost () Sufficient information is available to assess the applicability of activity data, drivers, emission factors or other estimation parameters (e.g. descriptions of how the data are collected, which definitions are used, geographic coverage). ® 1. Choice of activity data 33. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of activity data, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the activity data are the cause of the adjustment, and if no national data are available, expert review teams should use, in order of preference: Recommended international data sources as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I (a) Extrapolation (interpolation) methods if the international data sources do not provide data for the year in question, in which case the activity data should be obtained as follows (in order of preference): (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) of national activity data, if these data are available as required in paragraph 29 above, and were collected in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (1) Extrapolation (interpolation) of data from recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I (i) Extrapolation (interpolation) using drivers or surrogate data from the inventory review resources listed in appendix I (iii) Activity data based on appropriate drivers (e.g. activity data per capita) from a cluster of countries following the provisions of paragraphs 35-38 below. (©) 2. Choice of emission factors or other inventory parameters 34. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of an emission factor or other inventory parameter, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the emission factor or other inventory parameter itself is the cause of the adjustment, the expert review team should use, in order of preference: IPCC default values from the IPCC good practice guidance, the IPCC Guidelines or other recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I, and consistent with the [IPCC good practice guidance. If emission factors or other inventory parameters from other international data sources are used, the expert review team should, in the review report, justify and document the reason for their use (a) Extrapolation (interpolation) of the national emission factor, implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from earlier years as reported in the common reporting format (CRF) or national inventory report if the factor in question was prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (b) Average implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from a cluster of countries obtained as described in paragraphs 35-38 below. (©) 3. Choice of drivers and clusters 35. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use of a driver, the expert review team should use the recommended drivers as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. 36. If an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries is used, expert review teams should follow the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. The inclusion in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I of drivers and approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data should be subject to guidance by lead reviewers in accordance with the provisions of appendix 1. 37. Expert review teams should report the reason for the use of drivers and clusters and demonstrate the appropriateness of the cluster and/or the correlation between the driver and the emissions or removals. The use of drivers or approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data other than those recommended in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should be explained and justified. 38. When using an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries, assumptions made in choosing the cluster should be documented, as should how the given inventory average parameter compares with the default parameter or range provided in the IPCC good practice guidance or [IPCC Guidelines, where available. Similarly, when clustering is related to the use of a driver (application of an average driver-based emission or removal rate) from a cluster of countries, assumptions made for the composition of the cluster and the established relationship with the driver should be documented. 39. The clusters'” to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria, taking into account expert judgement: Only Annex I Parties that have undergone an individual review, and for which the relevant data were deemed accurate during the review process and for which no adjustment to any inventory parameter of the gases or categories concerned was made, should be included. Inventory data from the Party subject to adjustment should be excluded from the cluster (a) The cluster should cover a minimum number of countries, as specified in the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data (b) The grouping of countries into clusters should, to the extent possible, take into account similar national circumstances. National circumstances could relate to, inter alia, climatic conditions, economic development, operation or management practices, types of oil and gas activity, or the age of equipment or installations and their technical features, forest, land-use and soil characteristics, depending on the source or sink category in question. (©) 40. The drivers to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria: The driver shall be adequately correlated with the emissions or removals concerned (a) ' Because of the need to use reviewed data from other countries, clustering will only be possible for one year prior to the year in question. This implies that clustering would have to be combined with extrapolation techniques. The significance of the relationship between the driver used and the emissions or removals calculated needs to be demonstrated, taking into account national circumstances. (b) C. Details and variations on the basic adjustment methods 41. The following section provides further guidance on the application of the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A above. Because this section covers possible variations of those methods, the numbering and ordering do not match the list in table 1. 1. Default IPCC tier 1 methods 42. This basic adjustment method refers to default IPCC tier 1 methods as described in the IPCC Guidelines and as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance. If this adjustment method is used, the IPCC good practice guidance should always be consulted before the IPCC Guidelines. This adjustment method will only be applicable if activity data are available from national sources in accordance with paragraph 29 above or from international data sources as described in paragraph 31 above, or are obtained as described in paragraph 33 above. An emission factor or other inventory parameter as required by the method and obtained as described in paragraph 34 above should be used. 2. Extrapolation and interpolation methods 43. If extrapolation and/or interpolation methods are used, the expert review team should follow the guidance on trend extrapolation and interpolation provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, in particular, section 7.3.2.2 of the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and section 5.6. of the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. 44, Extrapolation of emission or removal estimates is applicable if inventory estimates are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the beginning (base year) and/or the end (latest inventory year) of the time series, and reviewed and time-series-consistent values are available for most years of the time series. 45. Extrapolation of inventory parameters (e.g. activity data): in addition to applying extrapolation methods to emission or removal estimates it may be necessary to use extrapolation at the level of activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). 46. Extrapolation of emissions or removals using drivers or surrogate data can be applied if inventory estimates are available for some years (at a minimum for all years but two) of the time series but are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the required year (base year and/or latest inventory year). The emissions or removals need to be strongly correlated with other well-known and more readily available indicative data (drivers). 47. Interpolation is applicable for calculating an adjustment for a given inventory year provided that reviewed values of the adjacent years are available. This method would most likely be applied in exceptional cases only, but could be applicable to activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances. 3. Adjustment methods based on correlation of emissions/removals between categories or gases 48. Correlation of emissions or removals between categories or gases within an inventory could in some cases be used to estimate emissions or removals of a specific gas or from a specific category. For example, CH, and N,O emissions from fuel combustion activities could be calculated from CO, emissions, if available. 4. Adjustment methods based on clustering of countries 49. Application of average inventory parameters from a cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances for the sector in question could be used to correct any inventory parameter (e.g. emission factor) that was found not to be in accordance with IPCC good practice guidance, or as input to the IPCC tier 1 method. The inventory review resources listed in appendix I provide recommended approaches and tools for clustering inventory data. If an adjustment has to be made for a given country, expert review teams should assign the Party in question to the cluster of countries to which it would most likely belong according to its national circumstances. 50. Application of an average driver-based emission/removal rate from a cluster of countries can be used if an emission or removal estimate is missing entirely or was not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance, but data for a parameter driving the emissions or removals from that source or sink are available for the country in question. The estimate is derived by establishing a relationship between emissions/removals and an appropriate driver for the cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances, and applying this relationship to the Party in question. If data for the driver are not available for the year in question, the driver should be extrapolated as described in paragraph 46 above. D. Conservative approach 51. The choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that emission estimates for the base year are not overestimated, and that emission estimates for a year of the commitment period are not underestimated relative to the likely true value of the emissions of the Party concerned. 52. Similarly, the choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that removal estimates for the base year are not underestimated, and that removal estimates for a year of the commitment period are not overestimated relative to the likely true value of the removals of the Party concerned. 53. As a principle to achieve conservative estimates, the calculation of an adjustment for a commitment period year should not result in an emission estimate that is lower or a removal estimate that is higher than that originally submitted by the Party, and an adjustment for an estimate of the base year should not result in an emission estimate that is higher or a removal estimate that is lower than the originally submitted estimate. 54. To ensure conservativeness for the purpose of adjustments, a conservativeness factor should be applied to the specific component of the estimation method used by the Party or to the emission/removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A of this technical guidance. For illustration purposes, this approach may be expressed as: M x CF = Adjusted estimate Where M is the component of an estimation method used by a Party, or the emission or removal estimate generated by a basic adjustment method in this technical guidance, and CF is the conservativeness factor. 55. The conservativeness factor should be selected from the tables of conservativeness factors provided in appendix III to this technical guidance. In the case that the tables do not provide a conservativeness factor for a given source/sink category, a conservativeness factor for a category with similar characteristics should be used. 56. For cases where only one component of an estimation method used by a Party is replaced, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to that component, in accordance with paragraph 22 above. In other cases, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to the emission or removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment method, in accordance with paragraph 24 above. 57. If, exceptionally, an expert review team considers that, in its expert judgement, the estimate generated by applying the basic approach referred to in paragraph 54 above is not conservative or is overly conservative for the Party concerned,'' the expert review team may use an alternative approach for applying conservativeness, and, where applicable, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 22 and 28 above. The expert review team shall justify and document the technical reason for its decision, and for its choice of the alternative approach used, and include this information in the review report. IV. Sector-specific elements 58. When calculating adjustments, expert review teams should follow the provisions of chapter 111 taking into account the sector-specific elements given below, as appropriate. The provisions of this chapter apply to the calculation of the adjustments before applying the conservativeness factor described in section IIL.D above. A. Fuel combustion 59. When adjusting CO, emissions from one or several disaggregated IPCC source categories, care should be taken that total CO, emissions are in accordance with the total fuel consumption, which is generally better known than the fuel consumption in each of the disaggregated IPCC source categories. 60. In the event that total CO, emissions from fuel combustion need to be adjusted, the reference approach is the preferred option for calculating an adjustment. Reference approach estimates should preferably be taken from the Party. If this is not considered appropriate, emission estimates from the IEA can be used. 61. If an N,O emission factor from road transport needs to be replaced, increased use of catalytic converters leading to increased emission factors should be taken into account when calculating an adjustment. B. Industrial processes 62. The expert review team should consider the possibility of double counting (for instance, the use of lime in iron and steel production) and avoid any double counting through the application of adjustments. 63. If adjusting hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), perfluorocarbon (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SFy) estimates from the consumption of halocarbons and SF;, consideration should be given to the uncertainty of sales figures (e.g. for sales of these chemicals to the foam blowing industry) and other parameters (such as the composition of the mix in coolants) as given in the IPCC good practice guidance. C. Agriculture 64. When adjusting emissions from agricultural soils, preference should be given to tier 1.a methods as provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. "" That is, the expert review team believes that the likely true value of the emissions or removals from a source/sink for a year of the commitment period is higher or much lower than the adjusted estimate generated, or the true value of the emissions from a source in the base year is lower or much higher than the adjusted estimate generated, taking into account any guidance from lead reviewers on this matter. 65. The expert review team should note that when adjusting emissions from manure management systems, savannah burning, or field burning of agricultural residues, the same activity data should be used for CH, as for N,O. 66. Similarly, consistent livestock data should be used for CH, and N,O emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management, and for N,O emissions from animal manure applied to soils. D. Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) 67. When using data from a cluster of countries, data should be selected on the basis of the similarity of these countries in relation to: National circumstances such as climatic conditions, vegetation types, management regimes, national policies and others (a) Choices in relation to definitions, data acquisition methods, and reporting of carbon pools'? and of activities in accordance with decision /CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7. (b) 68. Adjustments should not be applied in the case that a Party has not reported a category contained in appendices to chapter 3 of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry unless it was previously included in the inventory. 69. Estimates of emissions and removals in the LULUCEF sector and from LULUCEF activities may be based not on annual data but on extrapolations and may be recalculated at a later stage. For this reason, the application of an adjustment to the base year of cropland management, grazing land management or revegetation through an extrapolation should be done with care, given that data may not be reported for the years between the base year and the commitment period. If an extrapolation is needed for the base year of these activities, the expert review team could use as a driver the time series for the LULUCF sector included in the annual inventory submission under the Convention. 70. When expert review teams are choosing a basic adjustment method from table 1 for the LULUCF sector, they should carefully assess whether the IPCC tier 1 methods are indeed the most appropriate methods to derive a conservative estimate. E. Waste 71. Data on populations and/or urban populations, and GDP per capita, could be used in some cases to estimate the volume of solid waste, taking into account national circumstances. Urban population and protein consumption data could be used to obtain activity data to estimate emissions from domestic waste-water handling. Production data associated with the main industries in a specific country could be used as a possible driver to estimate the amount of industrial waste water, taking into account differences in technologies (e.g. emission per unit production). 72. For activity data, a cluster of countries based mainly on waste management practices could be used for estimating certain types of data, such as the waste generation rate, but not for estimating other types of data, such as the amount of waste incinerated or the amount of waste deposited, because these data largely depend on national environmental waste management policies. 73. When adjusting emissions from waste incineration, the applicability of drivers is very limited. ""2 If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. 73. 74. When adjusting emissions from solid waste disposal sites or waste-water treatment, the recovery of the methane needs to be considered. For solid waste disposal the expert review team should also take into account that if activity data are constant or increasing and the country used the IPCC tier 1 default method, this will have resulted in a conservative emission estimate. APPENDIX I List of inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments This appendix lists inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments using the adjustment methods and approaches described in the technical guidance. The information contained in the inventory review resources listed here will be maintained by the UNFCCC secretariat and made available to expert review teams by electronic means.

APPENDIX II Provisions for review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol that relate to adjustments I. Timing 1. Within the review of the inventory, the expert review team shall list all the problems identified, indicating which would need an adjustment, and send this list to the Annex I Party no later than 25 weeks from the submission due date of the annual inventory. This list should be prepared under the collective responsibility of the expert review team. 2. The Annex I Party shall comment on these questions within six weeks and, where requested by the review team, may provide revised estimates. 3. If adjustments are still needed, the expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with this technical guidance, in consultation with the Party concerned, and shall prepare a individual inventory review report which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates and related information, within eight weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed, and shall send the report to the Party concerned. 4. The Annex [ Party shall be provided with four weeks to comment on the individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether, and for what reasons, it accepts or rejects the adjustment. If the Party concerned disagrees with the proposed adjustment(s) the expert review team should send the notification from the Party, along with the recommendation of the expert review team, in its final report to the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. II. Reporting 5. The following information on adjustments shall be reported by the expert review teams in the review reports: The original estimate, if applicable (a) The underlying problem (b) The adjusted estimate (©) The rationale for the adjustment’' (d) The assumptions, data and methodology used to calculate the adjustment () A description of how the adjustment is conservative The expert review team’s identification of possible ways for the Annex I Party to address the underlying problem (9] The magnitude of the numerical values relating to an adjusted problem as: (h) The percentage by which the aggregate adjusted GHG emissions for an Annex I Party exceed the aggregate submitted emissions, defined as aggregate (1) !

(k) APPENDIX III Tables of conservativeness factors 1. This appendix provides two sets of tables of conservativeness factors to be used in the calculation of adjustments to ensure that adjusted estimates are conservative, in accordance with paragraphs 51 and 52 of the technical guidance. The first set of tables (tables 1 and 2) covers conservativeness factors for sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol. The second set of tables (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a and 4.b) covers conservativeness factors for emissions and removals from LULUCEF. For both sets of tables, these conservativeness factors are provided in two parts: For Annex A sources, one for use in the calculation of adjustments for a base year estimate and one for the calculation of adjustments for a year of the commitment period (a) For estimates of emissions and removals from LULUCF, separate factors are provided for emissions and removals, for use in the calculation of adjustments to the LULUCF sector during the initial review for the purpose of establishing a Party’s assigned amount (tables 3.a and 3.b), and for use in the calculation of adjustments of activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4 (tables 4.a and 4.b). (b) 2. In all tables, conservativeness factors are provided for emission factors or other estimation parameters, activity data, and emission or removal estimates for each IPCC category and Article 3, paragraph 3 and 4 activity, and corresponding gas. 3. When a given category is not covered in the table, the provision of paragraph 55 of the technical guidance applies, such as for categories “other” under industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, waste and the IPCC sector “7 Other”. 4. The conservativeness factors in these tables will be updated, as required, following the collective recommendation of lead reviewers, subject to approval by the SBSTA. Application of conservativeness factors to estimates from LULUCEF (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, 4.b) 5. According to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the technical guidance, adjustments should be applied at the lowest level possible at which the problem is identified. Therefore, there might be a need to apply adjustments to individual components (e.g. emission factors, inventory parameters or activity data) as well as to estimates of carbon stock changes from individual carbon pools. 6. To ensure that the selection of the conservativeness factors from the tables of conservativeness factors for LULUCF contributes to a conservative adjustment in line with paragraph 53 of the guidance, the expert review team should determine whether the individual component or the carbon stock change from the individual pool subject to adjustment leads to an increase of either emissions or removals, and choose the conservativeness factor accordingly from the respective tables, taking into account the year to which the adjustment is applied (base year or year of the commitment period, as appropriate). For any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing emissions, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.a, 4.a or 4.b as appropriate; for any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing removals, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.b, 4.a or 4.b, as appropriate. Background information on the preparation of the tables of conservativeness factors 7. The conservativeness factors are derived from uncertainty values and parameters provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, and in some cases are determined by expert judgement for the purpose of this technical guidance, as indicated below: If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for a component, this range for that component is used; (a) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for emissions or removals from a particular category or a combined uncertainty range can be calculated from the uncertainty values and/or ranges of the input parameters using the tier 1 method, the range generated by applying the uncertainty value for the category is used; (b) In cases where the [IPCC good practice guidance does not provide an uncertainty range for an estimate or a combined uncertainty range cannot be calculated because necessary information is not available, an assessed uncertainty range determined by expert judgement for the purposes of this technical guidance is used. (©) 8. Different conservativeness factors are provided for use in adjustments to estimate for a base year and for a year of the commitment period. The conservativeness factors are calculated using the 25"" or 75"" percentile of the range generated by an uncertainty value for the gas and category, as appropriate, for use in an adjustment for the base year, or a year of the commitment period, assuming a log-normal distribution. 9. The uncertainty values have been grouped into five sets of uncertainty bands, with corresponding conservativeness factors, by assigning a given uncertainty value to a given band. These bands relate to the underlying uncertainties, as follows: Conservativeness factors for emissions in the base year Conservativeness factor for emissions in a year of the Estimated uncertainty Assigned and/or removals in a commitment period range uncertainty band year of the and/or removals in the (%) (%) commitment period base year Less than or equal to 10 7 0.98 1.02 Greater than 10 and less than 20 0.94 1.06 or equal to 30 Greater than 30 and less than 40 0.89 1.12 or equal to 50 Greater than 50 and less than 75 0.82 1.21 or equal to 100 Greater than 100 150 0.73 1.37 40 1.21 75 Table 1 Conservativeness factors for adjustments in the base year (for sources in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol) Activity Emission estimates [CO, [ N,0 Jkcs[PEG SF, N e e I - — — emeawie Tow[ow en ] ow [ lom[on ] 2 Vanutucnring mdusiies andcomsmstion | 098 [ 02 [ 073 | ||| oo Joss[om[on| || | I 0 3 3.

A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 Annex Bangkok Declaration on Synergies and Responses: Strategic Alliances in Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice We, the States Members of the United Nations, Having assembled at the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held in Bangkok from 18 to 25 April 2005, to decide to take more effective concerted action, in a spirit of cooperation, to combat crime and seek justice, Convinced that the United Nations congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice, which constitute a major intergovernmental forum, have contributed to national policies and practices by facilitating the exchange of views and experience, mobilizing public opinion and recommending policy options at the national, regional and international levels, thus making a significant contribution to progress and the promotion of international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice, Recalling the work of the ten previous United Nations congresses, Reaffirming the responsibility vested in the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme to work, together with Member States and regional and international organizations, in the fields of crime prevention and criminal justice, Greatly concerned by the expansion and dimensions of transnational organized crime, including illicit drug trafficking, money-laundering, trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, illegal arms trafficking and terrorism, and any existing links between them, and by the increasing sophistication and diversification of the activities of organized criminal groups, Emphasizing that enhancing dialogue among civilizations, promoting tolerance, preventing the indiscriminate targeting of different religions and cultures and addressing development issues and unresolved conflicts will contribute to international cooperation, which is among the most important elements to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and reaffirming that no terrorist act can be justified in any circumstances, Reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism comply with all their obligations under international law and should adopt such measures in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, Alarmed by the rapid growth, geographical extent and effects of new economic and financial crimes, which have emerged as significant threats to national economies and the international financial system, Highlighting the need for an integrated and systemic approach to combating corruption and money-laundering, within existing frameworks and instruments, in particular those under the aegis of the United Nations, since those crimes can be conducive to the perpetration of other criminal activities, A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 Noting with appreciation the work of the regional preparatory meetings for the Eleventh United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,3 Declare as follows: 1. We proclaim our political will and commitment to achieve the aspirations and objectives as set out in this Declaration. 2. We reaffirm our continued support for and commitment to the United Nations and to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme, especially the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and the institutes of the Programme network, and resolve to strengthen the Programme further through sustained funding, as appropriate. 3. In a spirit of common and shared responsibility, we reaffirm our readiness to seek to improve international cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism, at the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels, in areas including extradition and mutual legal assistance. We seek to ensure our national capacity and, where appropriate, the coherence of our international capacity, through the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations, to engage in international cooperation, in particular in the prevention, investigation, prosecution and adjudication of transnational organized crime and terrorism and in discovering any existing links between them. 4. We welcome the entry into force of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and two of its Protocols.# We call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to ratify or accede to and implement the provisions of that Convention and its Protocols, as well as the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Corruption> and the international instruments against terrorism. In implementing the provisions of those instruments, we commit ourselves to full compliance with our obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. We support every effort to facilitate the implementation of those instruments. 5. We call upon donor States and financial institutions to continue to make adequate voluntary contributions on a regular basis for the provision of technical assistance to developing countries and to countries with economies in transition, in order to help build their capacity to prevent and tackle crime in all its forms and apply the United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice and, in particular, to facilitate their becoming parties to and implementing the international instruments against terrorism and the relevant international instruments against crime, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the international drug control conventions. 6. We support a more integrated approach within the United Nations in relation to the provision of assistance for building capacity in crime prevention and 3 A/CONF.203/RPM.1/1, A/CONF.203/RPM.2/1, A/CONF.203/RPM.3/1 and Corr.1 and A/CONF.203/RPM.4/1. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 criminal justice, and in cooperation in criminal matters of a transnational character, as a contribution to the establishment and strengthening of the rule of law. 7. We seek to improve our responses to crime and terrorism nationally and internationally, inter alia, by collecting and sharing information on crime and terrorism and on effective countermeasures, in accordance with national legislation. We welcome the important work done by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network in the area of trends in crime and justice. 8. We are convinced that upholding the rule of law and good governance and proper management of public affairs and public property at the local, national and international levels are prerequisites for creating and sustaining an environment for successfully preventing and combating crime. We are committed to the development and maintenance of fair and efficient criminal justice institutions, including the humane treatment of all those in pre-trial and correctional facilities, in accordance with applicable international standards. 9. We recognize the role of individuals and groups outside the public sector, such as civil society, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, in contributing to the prevention of and the fight against crime and terrorism. We encourage measures to strengthen this role within the rule of law. 10. We recognize that comprehensive and effective crime prevention strategies can significantly reduce crime and victimization. We urge that such strategies address the root causes and risk factors of crime and victimization and that they be further developed and implemented at the local, national and international levels, taking into account, inter alia, the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime.® 11. We note that countries emerging from conflicts are particularly vulnerable to crime, in particular organized crime and corruption, and therefore we recommend that Member States, regional organizations and international entities such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in coordination with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat and other relevant entities, provide more effective responses to these problems, in order to re-establish, strengthen or sustain the rule of law and deliver justice in post-conflict situations. 12. With regard to the increased involvement of organized criminal groups in the theft of and trafficking in cultural property and illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna, we recognize the importance of combating these forms of crime and, bearing in mind the relevant international legal instruments, such as the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property,” the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora® and the Convention on Biological Diversity,” we call upon Member States to take effective measures to strengthen international cooperation. 6 Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. 7 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 823, No. 11806. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 13. We note with concern the rise of kidnapping and trafficking in persons as serious, profitable and inhumane forms of organized crime, often committed with the objective of funding criminal organizations and, in some cases, terrorist activities, and hence recommend that measures be devised to combat these crimes and that attention be given to the creation of practical mechanisms for countering them. We recognize the need to implement measures intended to provide adequate assistance and protection to victims of kidnapping and trafficking in persons and their families. 14. Mindful of General Assembly resolution 59/156 of 20 December 2004 on preventing, combating and punishing trafficking in human organs, we note the serious concerns raised about the illicit removal of and trafficking in human organs and will examine with interest the report of the Secretary-General requested in that resolution. 15. We reaffirm the fundamental importance of implementation of existing instruments and the further development of national measures and international cooperation in criminal matters, such as consideration of strengthening and augmenting measures, in particular against cybercrime, money-laundering and trafficking in cultural property, as well as on extradition, mutual legal assistance and the confiscation, recovery and return of proceeds of crime. 16. We note that, in the current period of globalization, information technology and the rapid development of new telecommunication and computer network systems have been accompanied by the abuse of those technologies for criminal purposes. We therefore welcome efforts to enhance and supplement existing cooperation to prevent, investigate and prosecute high-technology and computer-related crime, including by developing partnerships with the private sector. We recognize the important contribution of the United Nations to regional and other international forums in the fight against cybercrime and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, taking into account that experience, to examine the feasibility of providing further assistance in that area under the aegis of the United Nations in partnership with other similarly focused organizations. 17. We recognize the importance of giving special attention to the need to protect witnesses and victims of crime and terrorism, and we commit ourselves to strengthening, where needed, the legal and financial framework for providing support to such victims, taking into account, inter alia, the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power.10 18. We call upon Member States to take steps, in accordance with their domestic laws, to promote access to justice, to consider the provision of legal aid to those who need it and to enable the effective assertion of their rights in the criminal justice system. 19. We note with concern the problem of trafficking in illicit drugs and the serious socio-economic consequences it entails, and therefore we call for the strengthening of international cooperation in combating that form of organized crime. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 20. We will strengthen international cooperation in order to create an environment that is conducive to the fight against crime, including by promoting growth and sustainable development and eradicating poverty and unemployment through effective and balanced development strategies and crime prevention policies. 21. We call upon States that have not yet done so to become parties to and implement the universal instruments against terrorism. In order to enhance the capacity of States to become parties to and implement those instruments and to comply with the relevant Security Council resolutions against terrorism, we express our support for the continuing efforts of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, within its mandate and in coordination with the Counter-Terrorism Committee and the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate of the Security Council, to assist States in their efforts to ratify and implement those instruments, through the provision of technical assistance upon request. This might include assistance to criminal justice systems to facilitate the effective implementation of those instruments. 22. We express the hope that the ongoing negotiation of the comprehensive convention on international terrorism will be concluded as soon as possible. In this context, we recognize that arriving at a possible definition of terrorism is one of the key issues to be resolved. We call upon Member States to consider signing and ratifying the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.!! 23. We are convinced that the expeditious entry into force and subsequent implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption!2 are central to the efforts at the international level to fight corruption, and therefore we accord high priority to supporting efforts to that end, and we call upon all States that have not yet done so to seek to sign, ratify or accede to it. 24. We are also convinced that the proper management of public affairs and public property and the rule of law are essential to the prevention and control of corruption, including, inter alia, through effective measures for its investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, we recognize that, in order to curb corruption, it is necessary to promote a culture of integrity and accountability in both the public and the private sector. 25. We are convinced that asset recovery is one of the essential components of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and, for that reason, we emphasize the need to adopt measures to facilitate asset recovery that are consistent with the principles of that convention. 26. We are conscious of the challenge of investigating and prosecuting complex cases involving economic and financial crimes, including money- laundering. We call upon Member States to strengthen policies, measures and institutions for national action and international cooperation in the prevention, investigation and prosecution of economic and financial crimes, including money- laundering, and such crimes conducted via, or facilitated by, information technologies, in particular in connection with the financing of terrorism and trafficking in illicit drugs. 11 General Assembly resolution 59/290, annex. 12 General Assembly resolution 58/4, annex. A/C.3/60/L.11/Rev.1 27. We are conscious of the crucial importance of tackling document and identity fraud in order to curb organized crime and terrorism. We seek to improve international cooperation, including through technical assistance, to combat document and identity fraud, in particular the fraudulent use of travel documents, through improved security measures, and encourage the adoption of appropriate national legislation. 28. We recommend that voluntary contributions and appropriate technical assistance be made available to developing countries, to strengthen their capacity in order to support their efforts to fight economic and financial crimes effectively. 29. As appropriate, we endeavour to use and apply the United Nations standards and norms in our national programmes for crime prevention and criminal justice reform and to undertake, as needed, efforts to ensure their wider dissemination. We endeavour to facilitate appropriate training for law enforcement officials, including prison officials, prosecutors, the judiciary and other relevant professional groups, taking into account those norms and standards and best practices at the international level. 30. We recommend that the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice give consideration to reviewing the adequacy of standards and norms in relation to prison management and prisoners. 31. We note with concern that the physical and social conditions associated with imprisonment may facilitate the spread of HIV/AIDS in pre-trial and correctional facilities and thus in society, thereby presenting a critical prison management problem; we call upon States to develop and adopt measures and guidelines, where appropriate and in accordance with national legislation, to ensure that the particular problems of HIV/AIDS are adequately addressed in such facilities. 32. To promote the interests of victims and the rehabilitation of offenders, we recognize the importance of further developing restorative justice policies, procedures and programmes that include alternatives to prosecution, thereby avoiding possible adverse effects of imprisonment, helping to decrease the caseload of criminal courts and promoting the incorporation of restorative justice approaches into criminal justice systems, as appropriate. 33. We affirm our determination to pay particular attention to juvenile justice. We will consider ways to ensure the provision of services to children who are victims of crime and children in conflict with law, in particular those deprived of their liberty, and to ensure that those services take into account their gender, social circumstances and developmental needs and the relevant United Nations standards and norms, as appropriate. 34. We stress the need to consider measures to prevent the expansion of urban crime, including by improving international cooperation and capacity- building for law enforcement and the judiciary in that area and by promoting the involvement of local authorities and civil society. 35. We express our profound gratitude to the people and the Government of Thailand for their warm and generous hospitality towards the participants and for the excellent facilities provided for the Eleventh Congress.",10/18/2005,2005_558873,Morocco,N/A,yes

Endorses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, as accepted by the sixteenth session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change held in Montreal, Canada, 1 to 8 May 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC good practice guidance), as an elaboration of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; 2. Decides that the IPCC good practice guidance referred to in paragraph 1 shall be used by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) in their preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories under the Kyoto Protocol; 3. Decides that adjustments referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol shall be applied only when inventory data submitted by Annex I Parties are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; 4. Decides that the calculation of adjustments shall commence only after an Annex I Party has been provided with opportunities to correct any deficiencies in accordance with the time frame and procedures set forth in the guidelines for inventory review under Article §; 5. Decides that the adjustment procedure shall result in estimates that are conservative for the Party concerned so as to ensure that anthropogenic emissions are not underestimated and anthropogenic removals by sinks and anthropogenic base year emissions are not overestimated; 6. Emphasizes that adjustments are intended to provide an incentive for Annex I Parties to provide complete and accurate annual greenhouse gas inventories prepared in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments are intended to correct inventory problems for the purpose of accounting emissions inventories and assigned amounts of the Annex I Parties. Adjustments are not intended to substitute for the obligation of an Annex I Party to estimate and report greenhouse gas inventories in accordance with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol; 7. Decides that adjusted estimates shall be calculated in accordance with the technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments contained in the annex to this decision. Such technical guidance shall ensure consistency and comparability and that similar methods are used for similar problems as far as possible across all inventories reviewed under Article §; 8. Decides that any adjustments applied to the base year inventory estimates of an Annex I Party shall be used in the calculation of the Party’s assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, in accordance with the modalities for the accounting of assigned amount under Article 7, paragraph 4, and shall not be replaced by a revised estimate subsequent to the establishment of the Party’s assigned amount pursuant to Article 3, paragraphs 7 and &; 9. Decides that any adjustments applied to the inventory for a year of the commitment period of the Annex I Party shall be used in the annual compilation and accounting of emission inventories and assigned amounts; 10. Decides that in the event of a disagreement between the Annex I Party and the expert review team regarding the adjustment, the issue will be forwarded to the Compliance Committee; 11. Decides that an Annex I Party may submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory of a year of the commitment period to which an adjustment was previously applied, provided that the revised estimate is submitted, at the latest, in conjunction with the inventory for the year 2012. Subject to a review under Article 8 and the acceptance of the revised estimate by the expert review team, the revised estimate shall replace the adjusted estimate. In the event of a disagreement between the Annex I Party and the expert review team regarding the revised estimate, the issue will be forwarded to the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. The option for an Annex I Party to submit a revised estimate for a part of its inventory to which an adjustment was previously applied should not prevent Annex I Parties from making best efforts to correct the problem at the time it was initially identified and in accordance with the time frame set forth in the guidelines for review under Article 8. ANNEX Technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol I. Objective 1. The objective of this technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol' is: (a) To provide for adjusted estimates that fully meet the requirements of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7;? (b) To ensure that adjustments are applied consistently,’ comparably and transparently, taking into account the time frames provided in the guidelines for review under Article 8, and that, as far as possible, similar methods are used for similar problems across all inventories subject to adjustments under Article 8. II. General approach 2. This technical guidance establishes general and specific procedures and methods for use by expert review teams to calculate adjustments. These procedures and methods are supplemented by inventory review resources listed in appendix I to this technical guidance, which will also facilitate consistency in calculation of adjustments by expert review teams. A. Procedures 3. The calculation and application of adjustments shall follow paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) attached to decision 21/CP.7. 4. Adjustments shall be applied, taking into account section II.B below, only when inventory data submitted by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) including supplementary inventory data on Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, are found to be incomplete and/or are prepared in a way that is not consistent with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as the IPCC Guidelines) as elaborated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports entitled Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry* (hereinafter referred to collectively as the IPCC good practice guidance), and any good practice guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). ! All articles referred to in this technical guidance are those of the Kyoto Protocol. Adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol are hereinafter referred to as adjustments. ? In this context, consistency means that the application of adjustments should be consistent across Parties and by all expert review teams. 5. Expert review teams shall, under their collective responsibility, calculate, document and recommend adjustments in accordance with the provisions for the review of annual inventories under Article 8 and this technical guidance. A compilation of the provisions relevant to the timing and reporting of adjustments from these guidelines is included in appendix II to this technical guidance. 6. The expert review team should collectively decide on the methodological approach for calculation of any adjustment, including relevant components of the adjustment method (such as data sources, drivers’ and clusters® used). 7. Expert review teams should apply the appropriate adjustment method, selected from table 1, in a simple manner, given the limited time available for the calculation of adjustments according to the provisions for the review of annual inventories in the guidelines for review under Article 8 (see paragraph 3 of appendix II). 8. Expert review teams should apply this technical guidance in a consistent and comparable manner and, as far as possible, use similar methods for similar problems across all inventories reviewed under Article 8, taking into account the provisions for obtaining conservative estimates, as described in paragraphs 51 and 52 below. 9. To enhance consistency in the application of adjustments for any given Party, the same adjustment method should be used, whenever possible, in cases where the same inventory problem was adjusted in an earlier year (e.g. for the base year or for an earlier year of the commitment period). This provision applies to both the basic adjustment method,” and the main components used in the calculation of the adjustment, as appropriate, such as the source of international data, drivers, clusters and any other inventory parameter used. 10. Any adjustments to estimates of emissions and removals for purposes of establishing the assigned amount under Article 3, paragraphs 7 and 8, will only be applied during the initial review under Article 8. 11. Adjustments should be applied only for individual inventory years, specifically the base year or the latest year of the commitment period under review, and not for an entire time series or group of years, except for cases described in paragraphs 12 and 13 (b)—(c) below. 12. Adjustments should not be retroactively applied for any year preceding the inventory year subject to review, except in cases where recalculated estimates for previous commitment period years and/or instances relating to paragraph 13 (c) below were submitted by the Party together with the inventory information of the inventory year subject to review. Where the Party submits recalculated estimates for commitment period years prior to the inventory year subject to review, adjustments may be applied retroactively for those estimates that have not yet been reviewed, if the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. 13. For estimates of emissions and removals resulting from activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, adjustments may be applied to an individual year or for a group of years, as follows: (a) For activities for which the Party has chosen to account annually, any adjustments should be applied during the annual review for the latest submitted inventory; > For the purpose of this technical guidance, driver refers to indicative data other than activity data or other inventory parameters used in the calculation of emission or removal estimates, that are correlated with emissions or removals, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, associated production data, wells drilled, GDP per capita. The criteria for selecting drivers for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 40. ® For the purpose of this technical guidance, cluster refers to inventory-related data from a group of countries. The criteria for selecting clusters for the purpose of adjustments are given in paragraph 39. 7 For the purpose of this technical guidance, basic adjustment methods are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section II1.D below. (a) For activities for which the Party has chosen to account for the entire commitment period, any adjustments should be considered and applied for any individual year or for any group of years of the commitment period, as necessary, only during the annual review for the final year of the commitment period. Adjustments shall not be considered or applied during any annual review prior to that for the final year of the commitment period; (b) For cropland management, grazing land management and revegetation under Article 3, paragraph 4, any adjustment to the emissions or removals in the base year resulting from these activities should be considered and applied according to the choice made by a Party regarding the periodicity of accounting of these activities (e.g. annually or at the end of the commitment period). In the case that the Party has chosen to account annually for these activities and submits recalculated estimates, adjustments may be applied retroactively for the base year, provided these recalculated estimates have not yet been subject to review and the provisions of paragraph 4 above apply to these recalculated estimates. (©) 14. The selection of data and other components required for an adjustment method should take into account the time series for any such component. 15. Even if some aspects of a particular case are not fully covered by this technical guidance, the experts calculating the adjustment shall adhere to paragraphs 3—11 of decision -/CMP.1 (Good practice guidance and adjustments under Article 5, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol) and, as closely as possible, to this technical guidance. B. Applicability of adjustments 16. In considering the need for an adjustment, expert review teams should adhere to standard inventory review approaches, which also include assessment of the time series for a given estimate. 17. If the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of emissions in the base year, or an overestimation of emissions in a year of the commitment period, the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied, if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate with a value for the base year that is higher than the original estimate submitted by the Party or a value for a year of the commitment period that is lower than the original estimate. 18. Similarly, if the expert review team finds that an estimate submitted by a Party leads to an underestimation of removals resulting from any activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, in a year of the commitment period, or an overestimation of removals in the base year for any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4 (cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation), the adjustment calculated in accordance with paragraph 54 below should not be applied if such a calculation would result in an adjusted estimate that is less conservative than the original estimate submitted by the Party. 19. An adjustment procedure should be initiated if the information provided by the Party is not sufficiently transparent, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 4 above. 20. If the expert review team identifies a deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance that is caused by the allocation of estimates to a wrong category or activity under Article 3, paragraph 3 or 4, adjustments should not be applied in the following cases:® ¥ In these cases, reallocation is recommended to the Party as part of the review of annual inventories under Article 8. If reallocation to the correct source category does not affect total emissions from sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol (a) (b) If the reallocation does not affect the accounting of emissions and/or removals from any individual activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or any elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4. 21. If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. (b) III. Methods and conservativeness 22. In general, expert review teams shall calculate each adjustment at the level at which the problem is identified, e.g. the IPCC category level or for the specific component in question. If the problem is limited to only one IPCC category, only the estimate for that source or sink should be adjusted. Similarly, if only one component of a given estimate is problematic (such as inconsistent, incorrect or misapplied emission factors or other inventory parameters, or activity data), the review team should replace only that component in calculating the adjusted estimate. For land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) estimates, consideration should be given to the spatial disaggregation of estimates, where relevant and applicable. 23. If the necessary input data or parameters are not available at the [IPCC category level at which the problem is identified, or the problem involves more than one component of an emission or removal estimation method used by the Party, or the complexity of the methodology used does not allow replacing only the problematic component in question, more aggregate data should be used as the basis for the adjustment. However, expert review teams should make every effort to make the adjustment at the levels at which the problems were identified, in order to avoid making data that do not qualify for an adjustment subject to the adjustment. A. Choice of methods 24, If an emission or removal estimate needs to be adjusted,’ the expert review team should choose one of the basic adjustment methods in this technical guidance for the calculation of an estimate for purposes of adjustment. 25. In choosing the basic adjustment method and the input data that are appropriate for a specific adjustment case, expert review teams should, in general, follow the methods listed in priority order in table 1, as appropriate, unless otherwise indicated in the sector-specific elements included in chapter IV. If the requirements for the highest priority adjustment method according to the table are not available, the next preferred adjustment method should be used. 26. If a consistent time series of estimates prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance is available and no more than two years’ estimates are missing, a simple extrapolation of this time series would be the most appropriate adjustment method. ? For example, if an emission or removal estimate is missing, if the estimation method used by the Party was not in conformity with the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance, or if there is a problem with more than one component (emission factor, activity data or other parameter) of the estimation method used by the Party. 27. If an adjustment is triggered by lack of transparency, and this lack of transparency precludes the expert review team from assessing possible cases of over- or underestimation or from assessing the cause of the potential deviation from the IPCC Guidelines as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance (such as inappropriate activity data, emission factors or methods), expert review teams should also apply the basic adjustment methods in the order of priority listed in table 1. Table 1. Basic adjustment methods to obtain an emission/removal estimate (in order of priority) Basic adjustment method Requirements/applicability 1 Default IPCC tier 1 Obtain activity data, emission factors and other estimation parameters following the prioritizations indicated in paragraphs 33 and 34 below 2 Extrapolation of emissions or Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in removals question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates is available 2 Extrapolation of emissions or removals Extrapolation/interpolation of emissions or removals based on a driver Correlation of emissions or removals between source/sink categories or gases within an L Only for a missing/inappropriate estimate for the year in question if a consistent time series of emission or removal estimates and a corresponding driver are available Emission or removal estimate for the gas/source/sink category that is correlated to the emissions or removals that need adjustment 4 Correlation of emissions or Emission or removal estimate for the gas/source/sink removals between source/sink category that is correlated to the emissions or removals categories or gases within an that need adjustment 5 Average emission or removal rate Driver for the country in question and emission or removal from a cluster of countries based rate per driver for a cluster of countries on a driver Note: The methods in this table are those methods that provide an emission or removal estimate before the application of a conservativeness factor described in section III.D below. Further details on the basic adjustment methods listed in this table are given in section III.C below. 28. In the exceptional case where none of the basic adjustment methods listed in table 1 is suitable for a given adjustment case, expert review teams may use other adjustment methods. If adjustment methods other than those included in this technical guidance are applied, expert review teams should report the reason for not using any of the basic adjustment methods of this technical guidance and should justify why they consider the method chosen as appropriate. B. Choice of data and other components 29. In choosing any input data for calculating an adjustment, expert review teams should give, as appropriate, preference to the national data available in the respective Party’s inventory submission or made available by the Party before or during the review, provided that these data were not the cause for the adjustment. 30. Expert review teams should not conduct time-consuming searches for national data that have not been made available to the review team by the Party, or generate new country-specific data. 31. If national data as indicated in paragraph 29 above are not available or are not deemed suitable for the respective adjustment case, expert review teams should select data from the recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix 1. 32. The international data sources to be included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should meet most of the following criteria: (a) The organizations that make the data available are recognized intergovernmental organizations (e.g. United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International Energy Agency (IEA)) The data are regularly updated, maintained and disseminated The data are originally generated by the countries themselves (national statistics) (b) (©) (d) The data are widely applicable to Annex I Parties (e) The data are easily accessible by the secretariat and expert review teams (e.g. through Internet or CD-ROM)), in a timely manner and at reasonable cost (d) ) Sufficient information is available to assess the applicability of activity data, drivers, emission factors or other estimation parameters (e.g. descriptions of how the data are collected, which definitions are used, geographic coverage). 1. Choice of activity data 33. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of activity data, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the activity data are the cause of the adjustment, and if no national data are available, expert review teams should use, in order of preference: (a) Recommended international data sources as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix | (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) methods if the international data sources do not provide data for the year in question, in which case the activity data should be obtained as follows (in order of preference): Extrapolation (interpolation) of national activity data, if these data are available as required in paragraph 29 above, and were collected in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (1) Extrapolation (interpolation) of data from recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix | Extrapolation (interpolation) using drivers or surrogate data from the inventory review resources listed in appendix [ (ii) (iii) (o) Activity data based on appropriate drivers (e.g. activity data per capita) from a cluster of countries following the provisions of paragraphs 35-38 below. 2. Choice of emission factors or other inventory parameters 34. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use or replacement of an emission factor or other inventory parameter, e.g. either as input to the IPCC tier 1 default methodology or because the emission factor or other inventory parameter itself is the cause of the adjustment, the expert review team should use, in order of preference: (a) IPCC default values from the IPCC good practice guidance, the IPCC Guidelines or other recommended international data sources included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I, and consistent with the IPCC good practice guidance. If emission factors or other inventory parameters from other international data sources are used, the expert review team should, in the review report, justify and document the reason for their use (b) Extrapolation (interpolation) of the national emission factor, implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from earlier years as reported in the common reporting format (CRF) or national inventory report if the factor in question was prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance (c) Average implied emission factor or average carbon-stock-change factor or other inventory parameter from a cluster of countries obtained as described in paragraphs 35-38 below. 3. Choice of drivers and clusters 35. If the calculation of an adjustment requires the use of a driver, the expert review team should use the recommended drivers as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. 36. If an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries is used, expert review teams should follow the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data as included in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I. The inclusion in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I of drivers and approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data should be subject to guidance by lead reviewers in accordance with the provisions of appendix . 37. Expert review teams should report the reason for the use of drivers and clusters and demonstrate the appropriateness of the cluster and/or the correlation between the driver and the emissions or removals. The use of drivers or approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data other than those recommended in the inventory review resources listed in appendix I should be explained and justified. 38. When using an average inventory parameter from a cluster of countries, assumptions made in choosing the cluster should be documented, as should how the given inventory average parameter compares with the default parameter or range provided in the IPCC good practice guidance or IPCC Guidelines, where available. Similarly, when clustering is related to the use of a driver (application of an average driver-based emission or removal rate) from a cluster of countries, assumptions made for the composition of the cluster and the established relationship with the driver should be documented. 39. The clusters'® to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria, taking into account expert judgement: (a) Only Annex I Parties that have undergone an individual review, and for which the relevant data were deemed accurate during the review process and for which no adjustment to any inventory parameter of the gases or categories concerned was made, should be included. Inventory data from the Party subject to adjustment should be excluded from the cluster (a) The cluster should cover a minimum number of countries, as specified in the recommended approaches and tools for clustering of inventory data The grouping of countries into clusters should, to the extent possible, take into account similar national circumstances. National circumstances could relate to, inter alia, climatic conditions, economic development, operation or management practices, types of oil and gas activity, or the age of equipment or installations and their technical features, forest, land-use and soil characteristics, depending on the source or sink category in question. (b) (©) 40. The drivers to be used in the adjustment process should, to the extent possible, be selected according to the following criteria: 12 Because of the need to use reviewed data from other countries, clustering will only be possible for one year prior to the year in question. This implies that clustering would have to be combined with extrapolation techniques. The driver shall be adequately correlated with the emissions or removals concerned (a) (b) The significance of the relationship between the driver used and the emissions or removals calculated needs to be demonstrated, taking into account national circumstances. C. Details and variations on the basic adjustment methods 41. The following section provides further guidance on the application of the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A above. Because this section covers possible variations of those methods, the numbering and ordering do not match the list in table 1. 1. Default IPCC tier 1 methods 42. This basic adjustment method refers to default IPCC tier 1 methods as described in the [PCC Guidelines and as elaborated by the IPCC good practice guidance. If this adjustment method is used, the IPCC good practice guidance should always be consulted before the IPCC Guidelines. This adjustment method will only be applicable if activity data are available from national sources in accordance with paragraph 29 above or from international data sources as described in paragraph 31 above, or are obtained as described in paragraph 33 above. An emission factor or other inventory parameter as required by the method and obtained as described in paragraph 34 above should be used. 2. Extrapolation and interpolation methods 43. If extrapolation and/or interpolation methods are used, the expert review team should follow the guidance on trend extrapolation and interpolation provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, in particular, section 7.3.2.2 of the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and section 5.6. of the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. 44, Extrapolation of emission or removal estimates is applicable if inventory estimates are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the beginning (base year) and/or the end (latest inventory year) of the time series, and reviewed and time-series-consistent values are available for most years of the time series. 45. Extrapolation of inventory parameters (e.g. activity data): in addition to applying extrapolation methods to emission or removal estimates it may be necessary to use extrapolation at the level of activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above). 46. Extrapolation of emissions or removals using drivers or surrogate data can be applied if inventory estimates are available for some years (at a minimum for all years but two) of the time series but are missing or not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance for the required year (base year and/or latest inventory year). The emissions or removals need to be strongly correlated with other well-known and more readily available indicative data (drivers). 47. Interpolation is applicable for calculating an adjustment for a given inventory year provided that reviewed values of the adjacent years are available. This method would most likely be applied in exceptional cases only, but could be applicable to activity data, emission factors or other inventory parameters, depending on the circumstances. 3. Adjustment methods based on correlation of emissions/removals between categories or gases 48. Correlation of emissions or removals between categories or gases within an inventory could in some cases be used to estimate emissions or removals of a specific gas or from a specific category. For example, CH, and N,O emissions from fuel combustion activities could be calculated from CO, emissions, if available. 4. Adjustment methods based on clustering of countries 49. Application of average inventory parameters from a cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances for the sector in question could be used to correct any inventory parameter (e.g. emission factor) that was found not to be in accordance with [IPCC good practice guidance, or as input to the IPCC tier 1 method. The inventory review resources listed in appendix I provide recommended approaches and tools for clustering inventory data. If an adjustment has to be made for a given country, expert review teams should assign the Party in question to the cluster of countries to which it would most likely belong according to its national circumstances. 50. Application of an average driver-based emission/removal rate from a cluster of countries can be used if an emission or removal estimate is missing entirely or was not prepared in accordance with the IPCC good practice guidance, but data for a parameter driving the emissions or removals from that source or sink are available for the country in question. The estimate is derived by establishing a relationship between emissions/removals and an appropriate driver for the cluster of countries with comparable national circumstances, and applying this relationship to the Party in question. If data for the driver are not available for the year in question, the driver should be extrapolated as described in paragraph 46 above. D. Conservative approach 51. The choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that emission estimates for the base year are not overestimated, and that emission estimates for a year of the commitment period are not underestimated relative to the likely true value of the emissions of the Party concerned. 52. Similarly, the choice of adjustment methods and application of inventory parameters relevant to the calculation of adjustments should result in conservative estimates, in that removal estimates for the base year are not underestimated, and that removal estimates for a year of the commitment period are not overestimated relative to the likely true value of the removals of the Party concerned. 53. As a principle to achieve conservative estimates, the calculation of an adjustment for a commitment period year should not result in an emission estimate that is lower or a removal estimate that is higher than that originally submitted by the Party, and an adjustment for an estimate of the base year should not result in an emission estimate that is higher or a removal estimate that is lower than the originally submitted estimate. 54. To ensure conservativeness for the purpose of adjustments, a conservativeness factor should be applied to the specific component of the estimation method used by the Party or to the emission/removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment methods described in section III.A of this technical guidance. For illustration purposes, this approach may be expressed as: M x CF = Adjusted estimate Where M is the component of an estimation method used by a Party, or the emission or removal estimate generated by a basic adjustment method in this technical guidance, and CF is the conservativeness factor. 55. The conservativeness factor should be selected from the tables of conservativeness factors provided in appendix III to this technical guidance. In the case that the tables do not provide a conservativeness factor for a given source/sink category, a conservativeness factor for a category with similar characteristics should be used. 56. For cases where only one component of an estimation method used by a Party is replaced, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to that component, in accordance with paragraph 22 above. In other cases, the expert review team should apply the conservativeness factor to the emission or removal estimate generated by the basic adjustment method, in accordance with paragraph 24 above. 57. If, exceptionally, an expert review team considers that, in its expert judgement, the estimate generated by applying the basic approach referred to in paragraph 54 above is not conservative or is overly conservative for the Party concerned,'' the expert review team may use an alternative approach for applying conservativeness, and, where applicable, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 22 and 28 above. The expert review team shall justify and document the technical reason for its decision, and for its choice of the alternative approach used, and include this information in the review report. IV. Sector-specific elements 58. When calculating adjustments, expert review teams should follow the provisions of chapter I11 taking into account the sector-specific elements given below, as appropriate. The provisions of this chapter apply to the calculation of the adjustments before applying the conservativeness factor described in section II1.D above. A. Fuel combustion 59. When adjusting CO, emissions from one or several disaggregated IPCC source categories, care should be taken that total CO, emissions are in accordance with the total fuel consumption, which is generally better known than the fuel consumption in each of the disaggregated IPCC source categories. 60. In the event that total CO, emissions from fuel combustion need to be adjusted, the reference approach is the preferred option for calculating an adjustment. Reference approach estimates should preferably be taken from the Party. If this is not considered appropriate, emission estimates from the IEA can be used. 61. If an N,O emission factor from road transport needs to be replaced, increased use of catalytic converters leading to increased emission factors should be taken into account when calculating an adjustment. B. Industrial processes 62. The expert review team should consider the possibility of double counting (for instance, the use of lime in iron and steel production) and avoid any double counting through the application of adjustments. 63. If adjusting hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), perfluorocarbon (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SFg) estimates from the consumption of halocarbons and SFg, consideration should be given to the uncertainty of sales figures (e.g. for sales of these chemicals to the foam blowing industry) and other parameters (such as the composition of the mix in coolants) as given in the IPCC good practice guidance. "" That is, the expert review team believes that the likely true value of the emissions or removals from a source/sink for a year of the commitment period is higher or much lower than the adjusted estimate generated, or the true value of the emissions from a source in the base year is lower or much higher than the adjusted estimate generated, taking into account any guidance from lead reviewers on this matter. C. Agriculture 64. When adjusting emissions from agricultural soils, preference should be given to tier 1.a methods as provided in the IPCC good practice guidance. 65. The expert review team should note that when adjusting emissions from manure management systems, savannah burning, or field burning of agricultural residues, the same activity data should be used for CHy4 as for N,O. 66. Similarly, consistent livestock data should be used for CH4and N,O emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management, and for N,O emissions from animal manure applied to soils. D. Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) 67. When using data from a cluster of countries, data should be selected on the basis of the similarity of these countries in relation to: National circumstances such as climatic conditions, vegetation types, management regimes, national policies and others Choices in relation to definitions, data acquisition methods, and reporting of carbon pools'? and of activities in accordance with decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7. (a) (b) 68. Adjustments should not be applied in the case that a Party has not reported a category contained in appendices to chapter 3 of the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry unless it was previously included in the inventory. 69. Estimates of emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector and from LULUCEF activities may be based not on annual data but on extrapolations and may be recalculated at a later stage. For this reason, the application of an adjustment to the base year of cropland management, grazing land management or revegetation through an extrapolation should be done with care, given that data may not be reported for the years between the base year and the commitment period. If an extrapolation is needed for the base year of these activities, the expert review team could use as a driver the time series for the LULUCF sector included in the annual inventory submission under the Convention. 70. When expert review teams are choosing a basic adjustment method from table 1 for the LULUCF sector, they should carefully assess whether the IPCC tier 1 methods are indeed the most appropriate methods to derive a conservative estimate. E. Waste 71. Data on populations and/or urban populations, and GDP per capita, could be used in some cases to estimate the volume of solid waste, taking into account national circumstances. Urban population and protein consumption data could be used to obtain activity data to estimate emissions from domestic waste-water handling. Production data associated with the main industries in a specific country could be used as a possible driver to estimate the amount of industrial waste water, taking into account differences in technologies (e.g. emission per unit production). If a Party has chosen not to account for a given carbon pool for an activity under Article 3, paragraph 3, or an elected activity under Article 3, paragraph 4, an adjustment for this pool should not be applied for reasons of incompleteness as long as the Party has demonstrated, in accordance with paragraph 21 of the annex to decision -/CMP.1 (Land use, land-use change and forestry) attached to decision 11/CP.7, that the pool in question is not a source. 72. For activity data, a cluster of countries based mainly on waste management practices could be used for estimating certain types of data, such as the waste generation rate, but not for estimating other types of data, such as the amount of waste incinerated or the amount of waste deposited, because these data largely depend on national environmental waste management policies. 73. When adjusting emissions from waste incineration, the applicability of drivers is very limited. 74. When adjusting emissions from solid waste disposal sites or waste-water treatment, the recovery of the methane needs to be considered. For solid waste disposal the expert review team should also take into account that if activity data are constant or increasing and the country used the IPCC tier 1 default method, this will have resulted in a conservative emission estimate. 73 APPENDIX I List of inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments This appendix lists inventory review resources relevant for the calculation of adjustments using the adjustment methods and approaches described in the technical guidance. The information contained in the inventory review resources listed here will be maintained by the UNFCCC secretariat and made available to expert review teams by electronic means. This information will be updated periodically following the collective recommendation of lead reviewers on ways to improve the review process,' including the consistent application of the technical guidance by expert review teams. A. Resources for supporting the review of GHG inventories 1. Recommendations for improving the technical review of GHG inventories and for applying common approaches in the review by expert review teams (resulting from meetings of lead reviewers) 2.

Information on previous adjustment calculations by expert review teams. ! This would also include any guidance for identifying departures from the IPCC good practice guidance. APPENDIX II Provisions for review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol that relate to adjustments I. Timing 1. Within the review of the inventory, the expert review team shall list all the problems identified, indicating which would need an adjustment, and send this list to the Annex I Party no later than 25 weeks from the submission due date of the annual inventory. This list should be prepared under the collective responsibility of the expert review team. 2. The Annex I Party shall comment on these questions within six weeks and, where requested by the review team, may provide revised estimates. 3. If adjustments are still needed, the expert review team shall calculate adjustments in accordance with this technical guidance, in consultation with the Party concerned, and shall prepare a individual inventory review report which includes, where appropriate, adjusted estimates and related information, within eight weeks of the receipt of the comments on the questions posed, and shall send the report to the Party concerned. 4. The Annex I Party shall be provided with four weeks to comment on the individual inventory review report and, where appropriate, on whether, and for what reasons, it accepts or rejects the adjustment. If the Party concerned disagrees with the proposed adjustment(s) the expert review team should send the notification from the Party, along with the recommendation of the expert review team, in its final report to the COP/MOP and the Compliance Committee, which will resolve the disagreement in accordance with the procedures and mechanisms on compliance. II. Reporting 5. The following information on adjustments shall be reported by the expert review teams in the review reports: The original estimate, if applicable The underlying problem (a) (b) The adjusted estimate The rationale for the adjustment’ (© (d) The assumptions, data and methodology used to calculate the adjustment A description of how the adjustment is conservative () ® The expert review team’s identification of possible ways for the Annex I Party to address the underlying problem The magnitude of the numerical values relating to an adjusted problem as: (9] (h) The percentage by which the aggregate adjusted GHG emissions for an Annex | Party exceed the aggregate submitted emissions, defined as aggregate (1) !

This appendix provides two sets of tables of conservativeness factors to be used in the calculation of adjustments to ensure that adjusted estimates are conservative, in accordance with paragraphs 51 and 52 of the technical guidance. The first set of tables (tables 1 and 2) covers conservativeness factors for sources included in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol. The second set of tables (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a and 4.b) covers conservativeness factors for emissions and removals from LULUCF. For both sets of tables, these conservativeness factors are provided in two parts: For Annex A sources, one for use in the calculation of adjustments for a base year estimate and one for the calculation of adjustments for a year of the commitment period For estimates of emissions and removals from LULUCF, separate factors are provided for emissions and removals, for use in the calculation of adjustments to the LULUCEF sector during the initial review for the purpose of establishing a Party’s assigned amount (tables 3.a and 3.b), and for use in the calculation of adjustments of activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4 (tables 4.a and 4.b). (a) (b) 2. In all tables, conservativeness factors are provided for emission factors or other estimation parameters, activity data, and emission or removal estimates for each IPCC category and Article 3, paragraph 3 and 4 activity, and corresponding gas. 3. When a given category is not covered in the table, the provision of paragraph 55 of the technical guidance applies, such as for categories “other” under industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, waste and the IPCC sector “7 Other”. 4. The conservativeness factors in these tables will be updated, as required, following the collective recommendation of lead reviewers, subject to approval by the SBSTA. Application of conservativeness factors to estimates from LULUCF (tables 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, 4.b) 5. According to paragraphs 22 and 23 of the technical guidance, adjustments should be applied at the lowest level possible at which the problem is identified. Therefore, there might be a need to apply adjustments to individual components (e.g. emission factors, inventory parameters or activity data) as well as to estimates of carbon stock changes from individual carbon pools. 6. To ensure that the selection of the conservativeness factors from the tables of conservativeness factors for LULUCEF contributes to a conservative adjustment in line with paragraph 53 of the guidance, the expert review team should determine whether the individual component or the carbon stock change from the individual pool subject to adjustment leads to an increase of either emissions or removals, and choose the conservativeness factor accordingly from the respective tables, taking into account the year to which the adjustment is applied (base year or year of the commitment period, as appropriate). For any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing emissions, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.a, 4.a or 4.b as appropriate; for any component or carbon stock change that contributes to increasing removals, conservativeness factors should be selected from tables 3.b, 4.a or 4.b, as appropriate. Background information on the preparation of the tables of conservativeness factors 7. The conservativeness factors are derived from uncertainty values and parameters provided in the IPCC good practice guidance, and in some cases are determined by expert judgement for the purpose of this technical guidance, as indicated below: (a) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for a component, this range for that component is used; (a) If the IPCC good practice guidance provides an uncertainty range for emissions or removals from a particular category or a combined uncertainty range can be calculated from the uncertainty values and/or ranges of the input parameters using the tier 1 method, the range generated by applying the uncertainty value for the category is used; In cases where the IPCC good practice guidance does not provide an uncertainty range for an estimate or a combined uncertainty range cannot be calculated because necessary information is not available, an assessed uncertainty range determined by expert judgement for the purposes of this technical guidance is used. (b) (©) 8. Different conservativeness factors are provided for use in adjustments to estimate for a base year and for a year of the commitment period. The conservativeness factors are calculated using the 25"" or 75™ percentile of the range generated by an uncertainty value for the gas and category, as appropriate, for use in an adjustment for the base year, or a year of the commitment period, assuming a log—normal distribution. 9. The uncertainty values have been grouped into five sets of uncertainty bands, with corresponding conservativeness factors, by assigning a given uncertainty value to a given band. These bands relate to the underlying uncertainties, as follows: Conservativeness factors for emissions in the base year Conservativeness factor for emissions in a year of the Estimated uncertainty Assigned and/or removals in a commitment period range uncertainty band year of the and/or removals in the (%) (%) commitment period base year Less than or equal to 10 7 0.98 1.02 Greater than 10 and less than 20 0.94 1.06 or equal to 30 Greater than 30 and less than 40 0.89 1.12 or equal to 50 Greater than 50 and less than 75 0.82 1.21 or equal to 100 Greater than 100 150 0.73 1.37 40 1.21 75 Table 1 Conservativeness factors for adjustments in the base year (for sources in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol) Emission factors l.Energy | [ ] ] [ A ol combusion (et pprone) ||| 1.

Annex Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime Objectives 1. The present Guidelines on Justice for Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime set forth good practice based on the consensus of contemporary knowledge and relevant international and regional norms, standards and principles. 2. The Guidelines should be implemented in accordance with relevant national legislation and judicial procedures as well as take into consideration legal, social, economic, cultural and geographical conditions. However, States should constantly endeavour to overcome practical difficulties in the application of the Guidelines. 3. The Guidelines provide a practical framework to achieve the following objectives: (a) To assist in the review of national and domestic laws, procedures and practices so that these ensure full respect for the rights of child victims and E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 witnesses of crime and contribute to the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,3 by parties to that Convention; (b) To assist Governments, international organizations, public agencies, non- governmental and community-based organizations and other interested parties in designing and implementing legislation, policy, programmes and practices that address key issues related to child victims and witnesses of crime; (c) To guide professionals and, where appropriate, volunteers working with child victims and witnesses of crime in their day-to-day practice in the adult and juvenile justice process at the national, regional and international levels, consistent with the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power;* (d) To assist and support those caring for children in dealing sensitively with child victims and witnesses of crime. 4. In implementing the Guidelines, each jurisdiction should ensure that adequate training, selection and procedures are put in place to protect and meet the special needs of child victims and witnesses of crime, where the nature of the victimization affects categories of children differently, such as sexual assault of children, especially girls. 5. The Guidelines cover a field in which knowledge and practice are growing and improving. They are neither intended to be exhaustive nor to preclude further development, provided it is in harmony with their underlying objectives and principles. 6. The Guidelines could also be applied to processes in informal and customary systems of justice such as restorative justice and in non-criminal fields of law including, but not limited to, custody, divorce, adoption, child protection, mental health, citizenship, immigration and refugee law. II. Special considerations 7. The Guidelines were developed: (a) Cognizant that millions of children throughout the world suffer harm as a result of crime and abuse of power and that the rights of those children have not been adequately recognized and that they may suffer additional hardship when assisting in the justice process; (b) Recognizing that children are vulnerable and require special protection appropriate to their age, level of maturity and individual special needs; (c) Recognizing that girls are particularly vulnerable and may face discrimination at all stages of the justice system; (d) Reaffirming that every effort must be made to prevent victimization of children, including, among other things, through implementation of the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime;> 3 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1577, No. 27531. 4 General Assembly resolution 40/34, annex. 5 Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/13, annex. E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 (e) Cognizant that children who are victims and witnesses may suffer additional hardship if mistakenly viewed as offenders when they are in fact victims and witnesses; (f) Recalling that the Convention on the Rights of the Child sets forth requirements and principles to secure effective recognition of the rights of children and that the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power sets forth principles to provide victims with the right to information, participation, protection, reparation and assistance; (g) Recalling international and regional initiatives that implement the principles of the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, including the Handbook on Justice for Victims and the Guide for Policy Makers on the Declaration of Basic Principles, both issued by the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention in 1999; (h) Recognizing the efforts of the International Bureau for Children’s Rights in laying the groundwork for the development of guidelines on justice for child victims and witnesses of crime; (i) Considering that improved responses to child victims and witnesses of crime can make children and their families more willing to disclose instances of victimization and more supportive of the justice process; (j) Recalling that justice for child victims and witnesses of crime must be assured while safeguarding the rights of accused and convicted offenders; (k) Bearing in mind the variety of legal systems and traditions, and noting that crime is increasingly transnational in nature and that there is a need to ensure that child victims and witnesses of crime receive equivalent protection in all countries. III. Principles 8. As stated in international instruments and in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child as reflected in the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and in order to ensure justice for child victims and witnesses of crime, professionals and others responsible for the well-being of those children must respect the following cross-cutting principles: (a) Dignity. Every child is a unique and valuable human being and as such his or her individual dignity, special needs, interests and privacy should be respected and protected; (b) Non-discrimination. Every child has the right to be treated fairly and equally, regardless of his or her or the parent or legal guardian’s race, ethnicity, colour, gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability and birth or other status; (c) Best interests of the child. While the rights of accused and convicted offenders should be safeguarded, every child has the right to have his or her best interests given primary consideration. This includes the right to protection and to a chance for harmonious development: E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 (i) Protection. Every child has the right to life and survival and to be shielded from any form of hardship, abuse or neglect, including physical, psychological, mental and emotional abuse and neglect; (i1) Harmonious development. Every child has the right to a chance for harmonious development and to a standard of living adequate for physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social growth. In the case of a child who has been traumatized, every step should be taken to enable the child to enjoy healthy development; (d) Right to participation. Every child has, subject to national procedural law, the right to express his or her views, opinions and beliefs freely, in his or her own words, and to contribute especially to the decisions affecting his or her life, including those taken in any judicial processes, and to have those views taken into consideration according to his or her abilities, age, intellectual maturity and evolving capacity. Iv. Definitions 9. Throughout these Guidelines, the following definitions apply: (a) “Child victims and witnesses” denotes children and adolescents, under the age of 18, who are victims of crime or witnesses to crime regardless of their role in the offence or in the prosecution of the alleged offender or groups of offenders; (b) “Professionals” refers to persons who, within the context of their work, are in contact with child victims and witnesses of crime or are responsible for addressing the needs of children in the justice system and for whom these Guidelines are applicable. This includes, but is not limited to, the following: child and victim advocates and support persons; child protection service practitioners; child welfare agency staff; prosecutors and, where appropriate, defence lawyers; diplomatic and consular staff; domestic violence programme staff; judges; court staff; law enforcement officials; medical and mental health professionals; and social workers; (c) “Justice process” encompasses detection of the crime, making of the complaint, investigation, prosecution and trial and post-trial procedures, regardless of whether the case is handled in a national, international or regional criminal justice system for adults or juveniles, or in a customary or informal system of justice; (d) “Child-sensitive” denotes an approach that balances the child’s right to protection and that takes into account the child’s individual needs and views. The right to be treated with dignity and compassion 10. Child victims and witnesses should be treated in a caring and sensitive manner throughout the justice process, taking into account their personal situation and immediate needs, age, gender, disability and level of maturity and fully respecting their physical, mental and moral integrity. 11. Every child should be treated as an individual with his or her individual needs, wishes and feelings. E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 12. Interference in the child’s private life should be limited to the minimum needed at the same time as high standards of evidence collection are maintained in order to ensure fair and equitable outcomes of the justice process. 13. In order to avoid further hardship to the child, interviews, examinations and other forms of investigation should be conducted by trained professionals who proceed in a sensitive, respectful and thorough manner. 14. All interactions described in these Guidelines should be conducted in a child- sensitive manner in a suitable environment that accommodates the special needs of the child, according to his or her abilities, age, intellectual maturity and evolving capacity. They should also take place in a language that the child uses and understands. VL The right to be protected from discrimination 15. Child victims and witnesses should have access to a justice process that protects them from discrimination based on the child’s, parent’s or legal guardian’s race, colour, gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability and birth or other status. 16. The justice process and support services available to child victims and witnesses and their families should be sensitive to the child’s age, wishes, understanding, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic, cultural, religious, linguistic and social background, caste, socio-economic condition and immigration or refugee status, as well as to the special needs of the child, including health, abilities and capacities. Professionals should be trained and educated about such differences. 17. In certain cases, special services and protection will need to be instituted to take account of gender and the different nature of specific offences against children, such as sexual assault involving children. 18. Age should not be a barrier to a child’s right to participate fully in the justice process. Every child should be treated as a capable witness, subject to examination, and his or her testimony should not be presumed invalid or untrustworthy by reason of the child’s age alone as long as his or her age and maturity allow the giving of intelligible and credible testimony, with or without communication aids and other assistance. VII. The right to be informed 19. Child victims and witnesses, their parents or guardians and legal representatives, from their first contact with the justice process and throughout that process, should be promptly and adequately informed, to the extent feasible and appropriate, of, inter alia: (a) The availability of health, psychological, social and other relevant services as well as the means of accessing such services along with legal or other advice or representation, compensation and emergency financial support, where applicable; (b) The procedures for the adult and juvenile criminal justice process, including the role of child victims and witnesses, the importance, timing and E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 manner of testimony, and ways in which “questioning” will be conducted during the investigation and trial; (c) The existing support mechanisms for the child when making a complaint and participating in the investigation and court proceedings; (d) The specific places and times of hearings and other relevant events; (e) The availability of protective measures; (f) The existing mechanisms for review of decisions affecting child victims and witnesses; (g) The relevant rights for child victims and witnesses pursuant to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power. 20. In addition, child victims, their parents or guardians and legal representatives should be promptly and adequately informed, to the extent feasible and appropriate, of: (a) The progress and disposition of the specific case, including the apprehension, arrest and custodial status of the accused and any pending changes to that status, the prosecutorial decision and relevant post-trial developments and the outcome of the case; (b) The existing opportunities to obtain reparation from the offender or from the State through the justice process, through alternative civil proceedings or through other processes. VIIIL. The right to be heard and to express views and concerns 21. Professionals should make every effort to enable child victims and witnesses to express their views and concerns related to their involvement in the justice process, including by: (a) Ensuring that child victims and where appropriate witnesses are consulted on the matters set forth in paragraph 19 above; (b) Ensuring that child victims and witnesses are enabled to express freely and in their own manner their views and concerns regarding their involvement in the justice process, their concerns regarding safety in relation to the accused, the manner in which they prefer to provide testimony and their feelings about the conclusions of the process; (c) Giving due regard to the child’s views and concerns and, if they are unable to accommodate them, explain the reasons to the child. IX. The right to effective assistance 22. Child victims and witnesses and, where appropriate, family members should have access to assistance provided by professionals who have received relevant training as set out in paragraphs 40-42 below. This may include assistance and support services such as financial, legal, counselling, health, social and educational services, physical and psychological recovery services and other services necessary E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 for the child’s reintegration. All such assistance should address the child’s needs and enable him or her to participate effectively at all stages of the justice process. 23. In assisting child victims and witnesses, professionals should make every effort to coordinate support so that the child is not subjected to excessive interventions. 24. Child victims and witnesses should receive assistance from support persons, such as child victim/witness specialists, commencing at the initial report and continuing until such services are no longer required. 25. Professionals should develop and implement measures to make it easier for children to testify or give evidence to improve communication and understanding at the pre-trial and trial stages. These measures may include: (a) Child victim and witness specialists to address the child’s special needs; (b) Support persons, including specialists and appropriate family members to accompany the child during testimony; (c) Where appropriate, to appoint guardians to protect the child’s legal interests. The right to privacy 26. Child victims and witnesses should have their privacy protected as a matter of primary importance. 27. Information relating to a child’s involvement in the justice process should be protected. This can be achieved through maintaining confidentiality and restricting disclosure of information that may lead to identification of a child who is a victim or witness in the justice process. 28. Measures should be taken to protect children from undue exposure to the public by, for example, excluding the public and the media from the courtroom during the child’s testimony, where permitted by national law. XI. The right to be protected from hardship during the justice process 29. Professionals should take measures to prevent hardship during the detection, investigation and prosecution process in order to ensure that the best interests and dignity of child victims and witnesses are respected. 30. Professionals should approach child victims and witnesses with sensitivity, so that they: (a) Provide support for child victims and witnesses, including accompanying the child throughout his or her involvement in the justice process, when it is in his or her best interests; (b) Provide certainty about the process, including providing child victims and witnesses with clear expectations as to what to expect in the process, with as much certainty as possible. The child’s participation in hearings and trials should be planned ahead of time and every effort should be made to ensure continuity in the relationships between children and the professionals in contact with them throughout the process; E/CN.15/2005/L.2/Rev.1 (c) Ensure that trials take place as soon as practical, unless delays are in the child’s best interest. Investigation of crimes involving child victims and witnesses should also be expedited and there should be procedures, laws or court rules that provide for cases involving child victims and witnesses to be expedited; (d) Use child-sensitive procedures, including interview rooms designed for children, interdisciplinary services for child victims integrated in the same location, modified court environments that take child witnesses into consideration, recesses during a child’s testimony, hearings scheduled at times of day appropriate to the age and maturity of the child, an appropriate notification system to ensure the child goes to court only when necessary and other appropriate measures to facilitate the child’s testimony. 31. Professionals should also implement measures: (a) To limit the number of interviews: special procedures for collection of evidence from child victims and witnesses should be implemented in order to reduce the number of interviews, statements, hearings and, specifically, unnecessary contact with the justice process, such as through use of video recording; (b) To ensure that child victims and witnesses are protected, if compatible with the legal system and with due respect for the rights of the defence, from being cross-examined by the alleged perpetrator: as necessary, child victims and witnesses should be interviewed, and examined in court, out of sight of the alleged perpetrator, and separate courthouse waiting rooms and private interview areas should be provided; (c) To ensure that child victims and witnesses are questioned in a child- sensitive manner and allow for the exercise of supervision by judges, facilitate testimony and reduce potential intimidation, for example by using testimonial aids or appointing psychological experts. XII. The right to safety 32. Where the safety of a child victim or witness may be at risk, appropriate measures should be taken to require the reporting of those safety risks to appropriate authorities and to protect the child from such risk before, during and after the justice process. 33. Professionals who come into contact with children should be required to notify appropriate authorities if they suspect that a child victim or witness has been harmed, is being harmed or is likely to be harmed. 34. Professionals should be trained in recognizing and preventing intimidation, threats and harm to child victims and witnesses. Where child victims and witnesses may be the subject of intimidation, threats or harm, appropriate conditions should be put in place to ensure the safety of the child. Such safeguards could include: (a) Avoiding direct contact between child victims and witnesses and the alleged perpetrators at any point in the justice process; (b) Using court-ordered restraining orders supported by a registry system; (c) Ordering pre-trial detention of the accused and setting special “no contact” bail conditions; 10 (d) Placing the accused under house arrest; (e) Wherever possible and appropriate, giving child victims and witnesses protection by the police or other relevant agencies and safeguarding their whereabouts from disclosure. XIII. The right to reparation 35. Child victims should, wherever possible, receive reparation in order to achieve full redress, reintegration and recovery.

Provided the proceedings are child-sensitive and respect these Guidelines, combined criminal and reparations proceedings should be encouraged, together with informal and community justice procedures such as restorative justice. 37. Reparation may include restitution from the offender ordered in the criminal court, aid from victim compensation programmes administered by the State and damages ordered to be paid in civil proceedings. Where possible, costs of social and educational reintegration, medical treatment, mental health care and legal services should be addressed. Procedures should be instituted to ensure enforcement of reparation orders and payment of reparation before fines. XIV. The right to special preventive measures 38. In addition to preventive measures that should be in place for all children, special strategies are required for child victims and witnesses who are particularly vulnerable to recurring victimization or offending. 39. Professionals should develop and implement comprehensive and specially tailored strategies and interventions in cases where there are risks that child victims may be victimized further. These strategies and interventions should take into account the nature of the victimization, including victimization related to abuse in the home, sexual exploitation, abuse in institutional settings and trafficking. The strategies may include those based on government, neighbourhood and citizen initiatives. XV. Implementation 40. Adequate training, education and information should be made available to professionals, working with child victims and witnesses with a view to improving and sustaining specialized methods, approaches and attitudes in order to protect and deal effectively and sensitively with child victims and witnesses. 41.

Professionals should make every effort to adopt an interdisciplinary and cooperative approach in aiding children by familiarizing themselves with the wide array of available services, such as victim support, advocacy, economic assistance, counselling, education, health, legal and social services. This approach may include protocols for the different stages of the justice process to encourage cooperation among entities that provide services to child victims and witnesses, as well as other forms of multidisciplinary work that includes police, prosecutor, medical, social services and psychological personnel working in the same location. 44. International cooperation should be enhanced between States and all sectors of society, both at the national and international levels, including mutual assistance for the purpose of facilitating collection and exchange of information and the detection, investigation and prosecution of transnational crimes involving child victims and witnesses. 45. Professionals should consider utilizing the present Guidelines as a basis for developing laws and written policies, standards and protocols aimed at assisting child victims and witnesses involved in the justice process. 46. Professionals should be enabled to periodically review and evaluate their role, together with other agencies in the justice process, in ensuring the protection of the rights of the child and the effective implementation of the present Guidelines. 12",05/25/2005,2005_592283,Morocco,* On behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the European Union.,yes
