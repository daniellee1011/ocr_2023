girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability of women and girls to make use of their capabilities, Recalling that the threat of violence, including all forms of harassment, is a permanent constraint on the mobility of women and girls, limits their access to resources, services and basic activities, and impedes their economic and political empowerment, Emphasizing the need for States, and all segments of society, including civil society organizations, the private sector and

order to break the intergenerational cycles of violence, Recognizing that poverty and lack of empowerment of women, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies

increase their vulnerability to all forms of violence and limit their ability to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political autonomy, Expressing concern that

violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and as such is unacceptable, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between women and men, and that all forms of violence against women and girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability of women and girls to make use of their capabilities, Recalling that the threat of violence, including all forms of harassment, is a permanent constraint on the mobility of women and girls, limits their access to resources, services and basic activities, and impedes their economic and political empowerment, Emphasizing the need for States, and all segments of society, including civil society organizations, the private sector and media, as well as community leaders, including tribal leaders, and religious leaders to take meaningful steps to promote the empowerment of women and girls in order to achieve gender

sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence, are impediments to the development of their full potential as equal partners in all aspects of life, as well as obstacles to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, Recognizing also the continuing need to increase women’s full and effective participation in all actions and activities related to the prevention and resolution of armed conflict, the maintenance of peace and security and post-conflict peacebuilding in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions, including its resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and related resolutions, Recognizing further that harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage continue to be an impediment to not only the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development of

that indigenous women and girls, women and girls with disabilities, older women, migrants and minorities often experience multiple forms of discrimination, which may increase their vulnerability to all forms of violence and limit their ability to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political autonomy, Expressing concern that social norms and legal constraints

protection and secure an adequate standard of living, Recognizing that violence against women has both short- and long-term adverse consequences for women’s health, including their sexual and reproductive health, and for the enjoyment of their human rights, and that respecting and promoting sexual and reproductive health, and protecting and fulfilling reproductive rights in accordance with

achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women to enable them to enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to prevent and mitigate violence against women, Recognizing also the important role of the United Nations system, in particular of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, in addressing discrimination and violence against women and girls at the global, regional and national levels and in assisting States, upon their request, in their efforts to eliminate and prevent all forms of violence against women and girls, and highlighting

This war, unprecedented by its scale and ferocity, turned into a great tragedy for the peoples of Europe, Asia and the world. A threat to the very basic principles of civilization was averted at the cost of colossal joint efforts and grave losses. Through the suffering and death of millions of people, the world community came to realize the indispensability of a system of collective security and the necessity of establishing reliable machinery to ensure international peace. The burning desire to spare humanity forever from the miseries of war inspired States to adopt a reliable mechanism for maintaining international peace and security: the United Nations. The objectives set for the Organization when it was established are still relevant. Among them are strengthening of an equitable world order based on the principles of humanism and mutually beneficial cooperation, effective maintenance of international peace and security, and promotion of sustained development in the political, socioeconomic and other spheres. Today we need to remember the lessons of the Second World War and to work to promote the preservation of the historical memory of peoples. The perception of the victory won in 1945 as a common value for all of humanity is essential for the consolidation of the international community to address dangerous modern challenges and threats. The memory of the victory over fascism is also relevant in terms of preventing attempts to revise the results of the Second World War and the conclusions of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as well as in light of the objectives of the United Nations to oppose crimes based on race, nationality and ethnic origin and the spread of ideas of intolerance and related contemporary forms of racial discrimination. It is in the direct interest of humanity to further strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as the central element in the collective security system designed to put into practice the high goal proclaimed in the United Nations Charter: “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Consideration of this agenda item could lead to the adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution on the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War. This would make it possible to hold a special solemn meeting of the Assembly in memory of all victims of the war. 3/4 A/69/191 Annex II Draft resolution on the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 59/26 of 22 November 2004, in which it, inter alia, declared 8-9 May as a time of remembrance and reconciliation, while recognizing that Member States may have individual dates of victory, liberation and commemoration, Recalling that 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a war which brought untold sorrow to mankind, particularly in Asia and Europe, Stressing that this historic event established the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, Calling upon the States Members of the United Nations to unite their efforts in dealing with new challenges and threats, with the United Nations playing a central role, and to make every effort to settle all disputes by peaceful means in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered, Underlining the progress made since the end of the Second World War in overcoming its legacy and towards reconciliation, international and regional cooperation and the promotion of democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular through the United Nations, and the establishment of regional organizations and other appropriate frameworks, 1.
