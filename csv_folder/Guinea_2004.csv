Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1. Stresses that the proposal of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and, therefore, unacceptable; 11. 12. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office in Geneva; 12. 13. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 13. 14. Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 14. 15. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from non-represented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 15. 16. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 16. 17.

Pursuant to Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations, the treaty was registered with the Secretariat of the United Nations. Membership ECOWAS is made up of the following 15 member States of West Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea- Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo. Aims and purpose The creation of ECOWAS arose from the determination to accelerate the economic and social development of the States of West Africa through effective cooperation. To that end, ECOWAS has as its principal aim the integration of the national economies into an economic and monetary union. This involves the promotion of cooperation and development in all fields of economic activity, particularly agriculture, natural resources, commerce, monetary and financial questions, and social and cultural matters for the purpose of raising the standard of living of its peoples, increasing and maintaining economic stability, fostering closer relationship among its members and contributing to the progress and development of the African continent. Institutions of ECOWAS The work and activities of ECOWAS are carried out through the following structures: Authority of Heads of State and Government, Council of Ministers, Executive Secretariat, ECOWAS Parliament, ECOWAS Court of Justice, ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development, West African Health Organization, West African Monetary Agency, and technical and specialized commissions (covering all sectors and meeting at both the senior official and ministerial levels). Activities, achievements and cooperation with the United Nations The creation of an economic and monetary union has involved ECOWAS countries in various regional programmes aimed at market, monetary, physical, production and political integration. The market integration programme led to the establishment of West Africa as a free-trade area in January 2000, accompanied by a regional transit arrangement for goods; a common external tariff is to be introduced in January 2005 as the next step towards a customs union. Free movement of persons within the region has been achieved and member States have adopted common ECOWAS passports and travel certificates. A common currency is being created on a gradual basis through the establishment of a second monetary zone by July 2005, which is to be merged later with the existing CFA franc zone. A regional payments arrangement exists and an ECOWAS travellers cheque has been introduced. A/59/232 ECOWAS physical integration programmes have led to the development of a network of trans-West African highways and a regional system of telecommunication links. In the field of energy, a West African power pool is being created which involves the coordinated generation, transmission, distribution and marketing of power from conventional, new and renewable sources of energy. In the real sector, ECOWAS is promoting public/private partnerships to create a conducive business environment. This involves assistance to regional professional bodies of the organized private sector in organizing such events as regional trade fairs, industrial forums and buyer/seller meetings for promoting joint ventures and trans- border investments. ECOWAS has played a pioneering role in the developing world with the establishment of a mechanism for regional peace and security. The ECOWAS mediation and peacekeeping operations entity (ECOMOG) helped to resolve the civil conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and Cote d’Ivoire. A regional early-warning system and a high-level mediation organ form part of the ECOWAS conflict-prevention mechanism in operation in West Africa. Over the years, ECOWAS has developed very close working relations with the United Nations system. The active involvement of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) led to the creation of ECOWAS, and since then ECA has supported key programmes, including the rationalization of West African intergovernmental organizations. ECOWAS involves the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the International Trade Centre and the World Trade Organization in its trade development programmes. United Nations Industrial Development Organization assisted in the formulation of an ECOWAS regional industrial master plan and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is involved in the adoption of a common agricultural policy and a regional food security programme for West Africa. The International Telecommunication Union is an active partner in the modernization of the regional telecommunications system; similarly, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization are involved in the ECOWAS environment programmes. The World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund participate in the social and cultural cooperation programmes (health, education, culture, gender and child protection). The United Nations Development Programme (particularly its Regional Bureau for Africa) and the Security Council have been involved in the ECOWAS economic integration and regional security initiatives, respectively. Conclusion It is the hope of ECOWAS that its desire to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations is shared by all members of the General Assembly and that a decision will be taken at the fifty-ninth session inviting ECOWAS to participate in the session and work of the General Assembly in the capacity of observer.
