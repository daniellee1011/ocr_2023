seriously Please reeyele OO GE.12-12168 A/HRC/19/L.16 undermined by the phenomenon of corruption and the transfer of funds of illicit origin, which may endanger the stability and security of societies, undermine the values of democracy and morality and jeopardize social, economic and political development, Noting the continued efforts of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, through its various intergovernmental working groups, to overview the review process of the implementation of the Convention, to advise on the provision of technical assistance to building institutional and human capacity in States parties for the prevention of corruption, and to enhance international cooperation, including in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, Noting with deep concern that, despite the progress made since the United Nations Convention against Corruption entered into force, only around 2 per cent of the estimated funds of illicit origin annually leaving the developing world are repatriated to their countries of origin, Affirming the mutual but differentiated responsibility of requesting and requested States in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, cognizant that countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all, including the right to development, address human rights violations and combat impunity, and that recipient countries, on the other hand, have a duty to assist and facilitate repatriation as part of their obligation of international cooperation and assistance under chapters IV and V of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and in the field of human rights, and in line with the commitment made at the 2005 World Summit to make the fight against corruption a priority at all levels and to curb the illicit transfer of funds, Concerned about the

information establishing a link between proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in the requesting State, which in many cases may be difficult to prove, Recognizing that States continue to face challenges in recovering funds of illicit origin owing to differences between legal systems, the complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow of funds of illicit origin, and noting the particular challenges in cases involving individuals who have been entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates, Recognizing also that legal barriers are often compounded by factual and institutional obstacles, the most salient being the lack of will to cooperate, especially on the part of financial institutions, which often maintain an unresponsive and inefficient mutual legal assistance regime that discourages States from submitting requests for assistance and prioritizes domestic cases over foreign requests, Convinced that the illicit acquisition of personal wealth can be particularly damaging to democratic institutions, national economies and the rule of law, 1.

A/HRC/19/L.16 2. Alarmed at cases of corruption that involve vast quantities of assets, which may constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, the deprivation of which threatens the political stability and sustainable development of those States, generates perverse incentives against building a democratic society and has a negative impact on the ability to fulfil their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all; 3. Asserts the urgent need to repatriate such illicit funds to the countries of origin without any conditionalities, and urges States requested to repatriate such funds to step up their efforts to trace, freeze and recover those funds in order to enable requesting States to fulfil their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all and to combat impunity; 4. Acknowledges the importance of achieving human rights-based policy coherence in the deliberations and actions by States Members of the Human Rights Council and in the intergovernmental process of implementing the United Nations Convention against Corruption on the repatriation of funds of illicit origin; 5. Invites the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to adopt a human rights-based approach when dealing with the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, and appreciates the continued efforts by the Open- ended Intergovernmental Working Group on Asset Recovery of the Conference to assist States parties in fulfilling their obligations under the Convention to prevent, detect and deter in a more effective manner the international transfer of funds of illicit origin and to strengthen international cooperation in asset recovery, bearing in mind that, regardless of the capacities, resources and willingness of the requesting State’s institutions and authorities, there is a victim society, which is a rights-holder, suffering the consequences of the transfer of those funds; 6. Welcomes the decision made at the fourth session of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption to convene open-ended intergovernmental expert meetings on international cooperation to advise and assist States with regard to extradition and mutual legal assistance, and notes with appreciation the Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative of the World Bank Group and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime; 7. Calls upon all recipient States to acknowledge that they have a mutual but differentiated responsibility towards societies affected by corruption, and to make every effort to achieve the repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin in order to diminish the negative impact of non-repatriation on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights in the countries of origin by, inter alia, lowering the barriers imposed on requiring jurisdictions at the tracing stage, especially taking into account the risks of dissipation of those funds, and by delinking confiscation measures from a requirement of conviction in the country of origin; 8. Calls upon all States requesting the repatriation of funds of illicit origin to apply the principles of accountability, transparency and participation in the decision- making process regarding the allocation of repatriated funds to the realization of economic, social and cultural rights in order to improve prevention and detection procedures, correct identified weaknesses or mismanagement, prevent impunity, provide effective remedies directed at creating conditions for avoiding new human rights violations and improve the overall administration of justice; 9.

of mutual benefit, and international law, and that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, Recognizing that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty eradication, the fight against hunger, and economic and sustainable development, Alarmed at cases of corruption that involve vast quantities of assets, which may constitute a substantial proportion of the resources of States, the deprivation of which threatens the political stability and sustainable development of those States and has a negative impact on the application by States of the maximum available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all, Deeply concerned that the

acceding to it, Taking note of the work carried out by different United Nations bodies, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as well as international and regional organizations in preventing and combating all forms of corruption, Recognizing that supportive domestic legal systems are essential in preventing and combating corrupt practices and transfer of assets of illicit origin and returning such assets, and recalling that the fight against all forms of corruption requires strong institutions at all levels, including at the local level, able to take efficient preventive and law enforcement measures consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular chapters II and III thereof, Appreciating the continued efforts of the Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption, through its various intergovernmental working groups, to overview the review process of the implementation of the Convention, to advise on the provision of technical assistance to building institutional and human capacity in States parties for the prevention of corruption, and to enhance international cooperation, including in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, Affirming the responsibilities of requesting and requested States in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, cognizant that countries of origin must seek repatriation as part of their duty to ensure the application of the maximum available resources to the full realization of all human rights for all, including the right to development, address human rights violations and combat impunity, and that recipient countries, on the other hand, have a duty to assist and facilitate repatriation as part of their obligation of international cooperation and assistance under chapters IV and V of the United Nations Convention against Corruption and in the field of human rights, and in line with the commitment made at the 2005

both requested and requesting States face in the repatriation of funds of illicit origin, taking into account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable development and stability, and noting the difficulties of providing information establishing A/HRC/19/L.16/Rev.1 a link between proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in the requesting State, which in many cases may be difficult to prove, bearing in mind that everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law, Acknowledging the progress made towards the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, butrecognizing that States continue to face challenges in recovering funds of illicit origin owing to, inter alia, differences in legal systems, the complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, lack of familiarity with the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow of funds of illicit origin, and noting the particular challenges in recovering them in cases involving individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates, and recognizing also that legal difficulties are often exacerbated by factual and institutional obstacles, Noting with deep concern that, as indicated in the comprehensive study prepared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the negative impact of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin to the countries of origin on the enjoyment of human rights, in particular economic, social and cultural rights,! only around 2 per cent of the estimated funds of illicit origin annually leaving the developing world are repatriated to their countries of origin, Noting the particular concern of developing countries and countries with economies in transition regarding the return of assets of illicit origin derived from corruption, in particular to countries from which they originated, consistent with the principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, in particular chapter V thereto, so as to enable countries to design and fund development projects in accordance with their national priorities in view of the importance that such assets can have to their sustainable
