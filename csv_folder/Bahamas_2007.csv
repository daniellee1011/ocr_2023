Also stresses that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and that they must exercise due diligence in order to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms; 4.
