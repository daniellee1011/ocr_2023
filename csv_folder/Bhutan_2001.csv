G), Recalling its resolution 1999/59 of 28 April 1999 and noting General Assembly resolution 55/102 of 4 December 2000, Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, Realizing that globalization affects all countries differently and makes them more susceptible to external developments, positive and negative, including in the field of human rights, Realizing also that globalization is not merely an economic process but also has social, political, environmental, cultural and legal dimensions which have an impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing that multilateral mechanisms have a unique role to play in meeting the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization and that the process of globalization must not be used to weaken or reinterpret the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which continues to be the foundation for friendly relations among States, as well as for the creation of a more just and equitable international economic system, Taking note of the Bangkok Declaration adopted at the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (TD/390) which asserted that solidarity and a strong sense of moral responsibility must be the guiding light of national and international policy and that more inclusive, transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making are required to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis, Deeply concerned at the inadequacy of measures to narrow the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries, which adversely affects the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly in the developing countries, Also deeply concerned that international cooperation for development has been downplayed on the agenda of the international community, including the United Nations system. Noting that human beings strive for a world respectful of cultures, identities and human rights and in that regard work to ensure that all activities, including those affected by globalization, are consistent with these aims, 1. Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State; 2. Also recognizes that, in addition to States’ separate responsibilities to their individual societies, they have a collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level; 3. Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries, formulated and implemented with their effective participation, and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making; 4. Expresses its concern that, while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity, it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the world’s population, affects the enjoyment of their economic, social and cultural rights; 5. Emphasizes that to fulfil the commitment made at the Millennium Summit to make globalization a positive force for all of the world’s people would, inter alia, require narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and between all countries, and creating an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of human rights by all peoples and for the eradication of poverty; 6. Stresses that globalization has to be monitored and managed with a view to enhancing its positive impact and alleviating its negative consequences on the enjoyment of all human rights, both at the national and the international levels; 7.

A/C.3/56/L.64 the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries; 5.

Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development; 7. Affirms also that the international community should strive to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that ensures respect for the cultural diversity of all; 8.
