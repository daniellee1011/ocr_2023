2001,General Assembly,Third Committee,Fifty-sixth session,112,Advancement of women,Dominican Republic and Suriname,N/A,The integration of older women into development,"The General Assembly, Recalling the purposes and principles of the United Nations, enshrined in its Charter, and the obligations enshrined in various human rights instruments, includin[%I the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Recalling also Economic and Social Council resolutions 1982/23 of 4 May 1982 on elderly women and the World Assembly on Ageing, 1986/26 of 23 May 1986 on elderly women and 1989/38 of 24 May 1989 on elderly women, General Assembly resolution 44/76 of 8 December 1989 on elderly women and Commission on the Status of Women resolutl'jn 36/4 of 20 March 1992 on the integration of elderly women into development, Aware that women constitute the majority of the older population and that, in the years to come, the number of older women will increase more rapidly in developing countries than in developed countries so that by the year 2020, 72 per cent of the worldwide population over sixty years of age will be living in developing countries and more than half of that population will be women, Recognizing the important contribution that older women have made, paid and unpaid, throughout their lives, in particular during their older years, to human rights, and to social, economic and cultural activities, Equally aware of the fact that older women, in all regions of the world, represent an important human resource, and that their contribution to society and development in the economic, cultural, political and social fields often remains unseen or unrecognized, 1 Resolution 34/180, annex. 2 See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1992, Supplement No. 4 (E/1992/24 and Add.1-3), chap. I, sect. C. Considering that older women have suffered from past discrimination and lack of opportunity and that in many countries the plight of older women is becoming more serious, Recognizing that the risk of impoverishment, particularly in old age, is greater for women because social security schemes are based on a history of continuous remunerated employment and older women have often spent their lives in unremunerated caregiving or in informal labour activity, and that in this regard women have also faced lifelong discrimination in respect of entering and functioning in the formal labour market, Concerned that lower educational opportunities available to women hinder their full participation in the public and political life of their country throughout the age continuum, Concerned also that post-menopausal conditions and diseases have been neglected in research, academic studies, public policy and service provision, and that the quality of life of older women is therefore in danger, Recognizing that the interrelationship of ageing and disability among women needs special attention, since lifelong neglect of women’s health, social condition, poor nutrition and hard physical labour leaves them at and after menopause especially vulnerable to the risks of disabilities, Aware that statistics are an essential ingredient of planning and policy evaluation and that few statistics are available on the situation of older women, Calling attention to the urgent need to develop and improve the publication of statistics by gender and age, and to identify and evaluate the different forms of activities of older women, which are not normally recognized as having an economic value, in particular in the informal sector, Believing that it is critical to mainstream the needs and concerns of older women into the planning process at all levels, Emphasizing the consequent need to adopt an approach for the advancement of women that takes into account all stages of life, so as to identify measures that respond to women’s needs and human rights, 1. Notes with appreciation the valuable contributions that non-governmental organizations have made in calling attention to the specific needs of older women and encourages them to continue to cooperate with the international community on behalf of these women,; 2. Invites international development agencies and organizations, including the United Nations Children’s Fund, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme, to take account of the potential of older women as a human resource for development, to include older women in their development strategies and programmes, and to encourage Governments to ensure the inclusion of women, regardless of age, in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions; 3. Urges, that the special problems faced by older women, such as income security, education, employment, housing, health and community support services, should be given explicit and full attention by the Second World Assembly on Ageing A/C.3/56/L.21 to be held in Madrid in April 2002, and should be dealt with in the International Plan of Action on Ageing to be adopted by the Second World Assembly; 4. Invites the Second World Assembly on Ageing to therefore include in its agenda an item entitled “Discrimination on grounds of age and gender”; 5. Recommends that older women should be accorded a respected role in society, which would reduce their isolation and permit their full participation in society, including participation in the development of policies and programmes that affect their well-being; 6. Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that in all future reports on the question of ageing, data are presented and analysed by gender and age, and that information is included on the needs and risks of older and very much older persons, most of whom are disadvantaged older women; 7. Recommends that, within existing budgetary resources or, where necessary, with the help of extrabudgetary or voluntary resources, the concerned specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system provide to the bodies responsible for the advancement of women, information that would enable them to undertake a precise and in-depth analysis of the situation of older women, including developing, if necessary, specific new methods for data collection; 8. Requests, therefore, that appropriate resources be invested in research and data collection on the situation of older women, to provide the basis for development of policies and implementation of programmes that recognize and reflect the past, present and future contributions of older women and that address the needs of older women relating to economic and social security, education and appropriate health-care services; 9. Invites relevant research and training institutions for the advancement of women of the United Nations, in cooperation with the regional commissions, to pay special attention to older women in their efforts to improve methodology for data- gathering on women; 10. Urges Governments, in cooperation with the non-governmental organizations concerned, to strengthen activities for the benefit of older women, taking better account of their specific needs; 11. Requests that the results of data collection and research on older women be widely disseminated in order to effect positive changes in policy development and programme implementation for all women of all ages.",10/25/2001,2001_451134,Suriname,N/A,yes

Recognizes that, while globalization, by its impact on, inter alia, the role of the State, may affect human rights, the promotion and protection of all human rights is first and foremost the responsibility of the State; 2. Reaffirms that narrowing the gap between rich and poor, both within and between countries, is an explicit goal at the national and international levels, as part of the effort to create an enabling environment for the full enjoyment of all human rights; 3. Reaffirms also the commitment to create an environment at both the national and global levels that is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty through, inter alia, good governance within each country and at the international level, transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system; 4. Recognizes that, while globalization offers great opportunities, its benefits are very unevenly shared and its costs are unevenly distributed, an aspect of 4 See resolution 55/2. 5 Resolutions S/23/2, annex, and S-23/3, annex. 6 Resolution S-24/2, annex. A/C.3/56/L.64 the process that affects the full enjoyment of all human rights, in particular in developing countries; 5. Recognizes also that, only through broad and sustained efforts, including policies and measures at the global level to create a shared future based upon our common humanity in all its diversity, can globalization be made fully inclusive and equitable and have a human face, thus contributing to the full enjoyment of all human rights; 6. Affirms that globalization is a complex process of structural transformation, with numerous interdisciplinary aspects, which has an impact on the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development; 7. Affirms also that the international community should strive to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by globalization in a manner that ensures respect for the cultural diversity of all; 8. Underlines, therefore, the need to continue to analyse the consequences of globalization for the full enjoyment of all human rights; 9.

Annex Recommendations on ways Governments and the United Nations system could support volunteering 1. General considerations 1. In these Recommendations the terms volunteering, volunteerism and voluntary activities refer to a wide range of activities, including traditional forms of mutual aid and self-help, formal service delivery and other forms of civic participation, undertaken of free will, for the general public good and where monetary reward is not the principal motivating factor. 2. Actions by Governments and the United Nations system are mutually reinforcing but are treated separately below for the sake of clarity. 3. There is not one universal model of best practice since what works well in one country may not work in another with very different cultures and traditions. 4. Support for voluntary activities does not imply support for government downsizing or for replacing paid employment. 5. It is not just targeted measures that have an impact on volunteering; general social and economic policy measures can also influence citizens’ opportunities and willingness to volunteer. A/56/L.27 6. Neglecting to factor volunteering into the design and implementation of policies could entail the risk of overlooking a valuable asset and undermine traditions of cooperation that bind communities together. 7. It is important to ensure that opportunities for volunteering in all sectors are open to both women and men, given their different levels of participation in different areas, and recognizing the potential positive effect of volunteering on the empowerment of women. II. Government support 1. It is recommended that Governments further support voluntary activities by creating a favourable environment, including through the following policies and measures, and taking into account the local cultural context. (a) Increasing public awareness of the vital contribution of volunteerism to the social and economic functioning of their communities through, inter alia, public information activities and public events (1) Highlight the contribution of volunteering; organize briefings and seminars for policy makers and the media. Official papers on the status of volunteering and the issues that need to be addressed can be published and widely disseminated. High profile events and campaigns can be organized on national days and on International Volunteer Day (5 December). Negative stereotyping of volunteers can be challenged. Promotion of volunteering can be achieved through special programmes and public service announcements or by joint initiatives such as award schemes; (i1) Encourage the media to play a supportive role in public awareness- raising activities; (iii) Disseminate the results of studies and surveys on the contribution of volunteerism through the media, schools, non-governmental organizations and other channels. (b) Taking general measures concerning encouragement and facilitation, preparation, training and recognition of volunteers (1) Provide, in a way complementary to the support from other sources, an adequate human and physical infrastructure for volunteering. This could include, inter alia, awareness-raising campaigns, development of a volunteer centre infrastructure, establishment of focal points or the use of pilot schemes and the promotion of online volunteering. Specific campaigns in the area of, for example, mass immunization, literacy, or low-cost housing, could include budgetary provision for the encouragement and facilitation, orientation and training, monitoring and recognition of volunteers; (i1) Facilitate the establishment and functioning of volunteer centres, which provide a valuable stimulus to formal service volunteering through advocacy, monitoring and encouraging new initiatives. National volunteer centres provide effective leadership in the formal volunteer movement, while regional and local centres ensure linkages with the grass-roots communities. Legal and fiscal frameworks are important factors in the sustainability of such centres and financial support may also be desirable; A/56/L.27 (iii) Provide or facilitate specialized training and the formation of professional volunteer managers and trainers in the area of formal service volunteering, including by introducing formal credentials and standards; (iv) Encourage public sector workers to volunteer, for instance by facilitating measures, recognition, career enhancement incentives and the establishment of a dedicated special unit. This sets a positive example for society and helps to strengthen the sense of collective responsibility. (c) Enabling fiscal, legislative and other frameworks, including for community-based organizations and not-for-profit organizations engaged in volunteering (1) Introduce enabling legislation. The goal is to encourage or inspire citizens to volunteer but allow the choice to rest with the individual or organization; it can also facilitate employee volunteering. It can provide tax incentives and subsidies for organizations, as well as coverage and protection against risks, in a way fitting the particular society; (i1) Facilitate partnership-building around volunteer-based activities of civil society, including arrangements for joint planning, implementation and monitoring. This could incorporate employee volunteer activities of the private sector. (d) Encouraging and undertaking research in the various aspects of volunteerism and its impact on society (1) Ensure that consideration of the issues regarding volunteering is based on a sound appreciation and analysis of the parameters, profile and trends of volunteering in the particular country context. Studies on volunteering can be undertaken by independent public policy research and/or academic institutions. Governments can also initiate research themselves, in partnership with other stakeholders; (i1) Establish the economic value of volunteering to help to highlight one important aspect of its overall contribution to society and thereby assist in the development of informed policies which take into account the different levels of participation of women and men, youth and older people in different fields of volunteering. (e) Ensuring citizens’ access to information on opportunities for volunteering (1) Facilitate the establishment of national databases on volunteer opportunities in collaboration with community-based organizations and not- for-profit organizations; (i1) Disseminate information through the media, schools, and other channels with particular attention given to ensuring that information is accessible also to disadvantaged segments of the population. Encourage media companies to support and expand the concept of pro bono public service announcements on behalf of volunteer-based organizations and activities. (f) Addressing the possible impact of general social and economic policy measures upon citizens’ opportunities and willingness to volunteer A/56/L.27 (i) Take into account the possible impact of general social and economic policy upon citizens’ opportunities to volunteer. Such a “volunteer check” could pertain to measures related to labour, for example, such as the length of the work week and the age of retirement, which have an impact on the profile of volunteering. Legal and fiscal measures could also be reviewed to assess whether they impinge negatively on the status of volunteer involving organizations, including issues related to juridical status, rights to associational activities, and resource mobilization. Subsequently, legal and administrative hindrances to volunteering, where they exist, can be reduced; (i) Give due weight to local ownership and citizen participation, to bring public services closer to communities and to open space for greater citizen engagement expressed through channels such as parental involvement in schools and community involvement in natural resource management; (iii) Recognize that transport, communication and other infrastructure, such as public spaces, enhances the capacity of people to organize for voluntary activities. This is especially true of geographically dispersed populations and of people living in poverty, as well as older persons and people with disabilities. It is desirable that the impact of such infrastructure on levels of volunteering be factored into the planning process. (g) Integrating volunteerism into national development planning, recognizing the potential contribution of volunteerism to the achievement of sustainable development goals (1) Extend the notion of volunteerism as an additional valuable component of national development planning to development cooperation policy. Recognizing and building strategically on rich, local traditions of voluntary self-help and mutual aid can open the way to building up a new constituency in support of development efforts. Forging a link in the mind of the general public in countries providing development assistance between domestic volunteering in those countries and volunteering in countries receiving assistance can also help enlist public support for development cooperation. (h) Participation of all population groups (1) Consider all means available for more people to become involved in voluntary activities and to be drawn from a broader cross-section of society, including youth, older persons and people with disabilities and persons belonging to minorities, targeting opportunities for voluntary activities to facilitate the active participation of those groups which have little or no access to the benefits of engaging in volunteering; (i) Promote volunteering within educational establishments and youth services; develop specific programmes to encourage youth volunteering; put in place systems to recognize and accredit volunteering by youth; and work with the media to present an attractive image of volunteering. This can have a significant impact on the level of youth participation and constitute a sound investment in a country’s human resources. A/56/L.27 III. Support by the United Nations system 1. It is recommended that the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, including the regional commissions, further support voluntary activities by creating a favourable environment, including through: (a) Awareness-raising (1) Raise awareness internally and with their partners as regards the role of volunteerism in the various areas in which they are active and can sensitize their constituencies as to the implications in terms of activities undertaken. At the political level, strategically manage and support volunteering and incorporate it into the agenda of their meetings; (i1) Undertake research and disseminate information about the cross-cutting link between volunteerism and major global concerns, including through technical and popular publications, workshops and Internet sites. This would serve also to extend recognition to volunteers and their organizations, which could be complemented by awards and other measures, including raising the profile of International Volunteer Day for Economic and Social Development on 5 December. (b) Recognition of the contributions of volunteers (1) Enhance and expand the current practice of extending special recognition to volunteers and volunteer-involving organizations across the United Nations system. (c) Involving volunteers in their programmes, interlinking with national initiatives (1) Include volunteers in their activities, supporting, inter alia, the establishment of volunteer schemes to address a range of global concerns. Where they exist, national and local volunteer centres could benefit substantially from the specialized expertise and networks of the United Nations system; (i) Actively encourage staff of the United Nations system to volunteer, utilizing their special skills and experiences. (d) Long-term planning for the enhancement of social capital by including all segments of society in volunteering (i) Make a strategic choice for the involvement of all segments of society, including youth, older persons and people with disabilities and persons belonging to minorities, targeting opportunities for voluntary activities to facilitate the participation of those groups that have little or no access to the benefits of engaging in volunteering.
