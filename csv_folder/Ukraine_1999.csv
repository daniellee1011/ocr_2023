The present Action Plan is offered as guidance to Member States in implementing the above-mentioned commitments. Organizations of the United Nations system,? other international organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations are invited to provide support to Member States in implementing the Action Plan, according to their available resources, specific mandates and the different roles that they are to play in achieving the goals set out in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction. 3. The Action Plan reflects the emphasis in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction on the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach involving demand reduction and supply reduction, each reinforcing the other, together with the appropriate application of the principle of shared responsibility. It stresses the need for services responsible for prevention, including law enforcement agencies, to transmit the same message and use similar language. 4. The Action Plan is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.?! It allows for flexible approaches to reflect social, cultural, religious and political differences, and it acknowledges that efforts to reduce illicit drug demand are at different levels of implementation in different countries. 5. The Action Plan recognizes that progress to reduce the demand for illicit drugs should be seen in the context of the need for programmes to reduce the demand for substances of abuse. Such programmes should be integrated to promote cooperation between all concerned, should include a wide variety of appropriate interventions, should promote health and social well-being among individuals, families and communities, and should reduce the adverse consequences of drug abuse for the individual and for society as a whole. 6. The Action Plan focuses on the need to design demand reduction campaigns and programmes to meet the needs of the population in general, as well as those of specific population groups, taking into account differences in gender, culture and education and 20 This may include, but is not restricted to, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, the Joint United Nations Programme on Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the International Labour Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Health Organization, as well as international financial institutions such as the World Bank. 2!

Yel’chenko Permanent Representative of Ukraine A/54/235 Annex I Explanatory memorandum International recognition of the Day of Vesak “Vesak”, the Day of the Full Moon in the month of May, is the most sacred day to millions to Buddhists around the world. It was on the Day of Vesak two and a half millennia ago, in the year 623 B.C., that the Buddha was born. It was also on the Day of Vesak that the Buddha attained enlightenment, and it was on the Day of Vesak that the Buddha in his eightieth year passed away. II Theteachings ofthe Buddha, and his message of compassion and peace and goodwill have moved millions. Millions around the world follow the teachings of the Buddha and on the Day of Vesak commemorate the birth, the attainment of enlightenment and the passing away of the Buddha. A Message from the former Secretary-General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to Buddhists on the Day of Vesak in May 1986 reads: “For Buddhists everywhere it is indeed a felicitous opportunity, while commemorating the birth, enlightenment and passing away of Guatama Buddha, to celebrate his message of compassion and devotion to the service of humanity. This message is today perhaps more relevant than ever before. “Peace, understanding and a vision of humanity that supersedes national and other international differences are essential if we are to cope with the complexities of the nuclear age. “This philosophy lies at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations and should be prominent in all our thinking, especially during this International Year of Peace.” I An International Buddhist Conference held in Sri Lanka in November 1998 expressed the hope that the United Nations would accord the Day of Vesak international recognition. The International Buddhist Conference also hoped that the Day of Vesak would be accorded the status of a holiday of the United Nations. However, we are informed and appreciate that a number of difficulties of an administrative, budgetary and other nature would arise if the General Assembly were to seek to create an additional annual United Nations holiday. A/54/235 We would, in the circumstances, request, as an alternative, that the General Assembly consider the adoption of a resolution that would; (a) Recognize that the Day of Vesak, the Day of the Full Moon in the month of May each year, is the day most sacred to Buddhists, who commemorate on that day, the birth of Buddha, his attainment of enlightenment and his passing away; (b) Permit appropriate arrangements, without cost to the United Nations, to be made (in consultation with the relevant Offices of the Secretariat and the Permanent Missions that also wish to be consulted) for international observance of the Day of Vesak at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations Offices. A/54/235 Annex I1 Draft resolution International recognition of the Day of Vesak at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations Offices The General Assembly, Acknowledging the hope expressed by the International Buddhist Conference, held in Sri Lanka in November 1998, that the Day of Vesak, the Day of the Full Moon in the month of May each year, be internationally recognized and, in particular, at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations Offices, Recognizing that the Day of the Full Moon in the month of May each year is the day most sacred to Buddhists, who commemorate on that day, the birth of the Buddha, his attainment of enlightenment and his passing away, Considering that international recognition at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations Offices would constitute acknowledgement of the contribution that Buddhism, one of the oldest religions in the world, has made, for over two and a half millennia, and continues to make to the spirituality of humanity, Resolves that, without cost to the United Nations, appropriate arrangements shall be made for international observances of Vesak at United Nations Headquarters and other United Nations Offices, in consultation with the relevant United Nations Offices and with Permanent Missions that also wish to be consulted.",11/12/1999,1999_340496,Ukraine,N/A,yes
