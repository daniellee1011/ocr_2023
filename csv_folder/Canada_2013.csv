Stresses that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, which includes the freedom to have, or not to have, or to 2/7 adopt a religion or belief of one’s own choice, and the freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one’s religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance, including the right to change one’s religion or belief; 2. Also stresses that the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief applies equally to all persons, regardless of their religion or belief and without any discrimination as to their equal protection by the law; 3. Strongly condemns violations of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief as well as all forms of intolerance, discrimination and violence based on religion or belief; 4.

Condemns violence and acts of terrorism, which are increasing in number, targeting individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities across the world; 6. Emphasizes that no religion should be equated with terrorism, as this may have adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of all members of the religious communities concerned; 7.

Expresses concern at the persistence of institutionalized social intolerance and discrimination practised against many on the grounds of religion or belief, and emphasizes that legal procedures pertaining to religious or belief-based groups and places of worship are not a prerequisite for the exercise of the right to manifest one’s religion or belief and that such procedures, when legally required at the national or local level, should be non-discriminatory in order to contribute to the effective protection of the right of all persons to practise their religion or belief, either individually or in community with others and in public or private; 11. Recognizes with concern the challenges faced by persons in vulnerable or marginalized groups or situations in exercising their right to freedom of religion or belief; 12.

Also emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, where the need to protect public morals is invoked to justify restrictions, such restrictions must respect the universality of human rights and the principle of non-discrimination and must be based on principles not deriving exclusively from a single tradition, as the concept of morals derives from many social, philosophical and religious traditions; 14. Expresses deep concern at emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief as well as the continued existence of instances of intolerance, discrimination and violence on the basis of religion or belief, including: (a) The increasing number of acts of violence and intolerance directed against individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities and other communities in various parts of the world, in particular those occurring in countries experiencing conflict or political instability; (b) The rise of religious extremism in various parts of the world that affects the rights of individuals, including persons belonging to religious minorities; (c) Incidents of hatred, discrimination, intolerance and violence on the basis of religion or belief, which may be associated with or manifested by the derogatory stereotyping, negative profiling and stigmatization of persons based on their religion or belief; (d) Attacks on or destruction of religious places, sites and shrines in violation of international law, in particular human rights and humanitarian law, as they have more than material significance for the dignity and lives of members of communities holding spiritual or religious beliefs; (e) Instances, both in law and practice, that constitute violations of the human right to freedom of religion or belief, including of the individual right to publicly express one’s spiritual and religious beliefs, taking into account the relevant articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,’ as well as other international instruments; (f) Constitutional and legislative systems that fail to provide adequate and effective guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief to all without distinction; 15.

All Forms of Discrimination against Women, Recalling its resolution 53/144 of 9 December 1998, by which it adopted by consensus the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms annexed to that resolution, and reiterating the fundamental importance of the Declaration and its promotion and implementation, 13-57665* ih 251113 CA AY A A Recalling also all previous resolutions on this subject, including its resolution 66/164 of 19 December 2011 and Human Rights Council resolutions 16/5 of 24 March 20111 and 22/6 of 21 March 2013,2 Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and their review outcomes, as well as the agreed conclusions and resolutions of the Commission on the Status of Women, Acknowledging the attention given by the Human Rights Council to the importance of women human rights defenders and of ensuring their protection and enabling their work in recent resolutions, and noting the panel discussion on women human rights defenders convened on 26 June 2012, Acknowledging that women of all ages who engage in the defence of all human rights and all people who engage in the defence of the rights of women and in issues related to gender equality, herein referred to as women human rights defenders, individually and in association with others, play an important role, at the local, national, regional and international levels, in the promotion and protection of human rights, in accordance with the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, including women human rights defenders, frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as a result of those activities, including through the curtailment of freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings, Gravely concerned that women human rights defenders are at risk of and suffer violations and abuses, including systematic violations and abuses of their fundamental rights to life, liberty and security of person, to psychological and physical integrity, to privacy and respect for private and family life and to freedom of opinion and expression, association and peaceful assembly, and in addition can experience gender-based violence, rape and other forms of sexual violence, harassment and verbal abuse and attacks on reputation, online and offline, by State actors, including law enforcement personnel and security forces, and non-State actors, such as those related to family and community, in both public and private spheres, Deeply concerned that historical and structural inequalities in power relations and discrimination against women, as well as various forms of extremism, have direct implications for the status and treatment of women, and that some women human rights defenders’ rights are violated or abused and their work stigmatized owing to discriminatory practices and those social norms or patterns that serve to condone violence against women or perpetuate practices involving such violence, 1 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/66/53), chap. II, sect. A. 2 Ibid., Sixty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 53 (A/68/53), chap. IV, sect. A. 2/7 Gravely concerned that impunity for violations and abuses against women human rights defenders persists owing to factors including a lack of reporting, documentation, investigation and access to justice, social barriers and constraints with regard to addressing gender-based violence, including sexual violence and the stigmatization that may result from such violations and abuses, and a lack of recognition of the legitimate role of women human rights defenders, all of which entrench or institutionalize gender discrimination, Concerned that all forms of discrimination, including racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, can lead to the targeting or vulnerability to violence of women human rights defenders, who are prone to multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of discrimination, Aware that information-technology-related violations, abuses, discrimination and violence against women, including women human rights defenders, such as online harassment, cyberstalking, violation of privacy, censorship and hacking of e-mail accounts, mobile phones and other electronic devices, with a view to discrediting them and/or inciting other violations and abuses against them, are a growing concern and can be a manifestation of systemic gender-based discrimination, requiring effective responses compliant with human rights, Stressing the obligation of States to take concrete steps to prevent threats, harassment and violence, including gender-based violence, against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women human rights defenders, who face particular risks of violence, Mindful that domestic law and administrative provisions and their application should enable the work of women human rights defenders, including by avoiding any criminalization or stigmatization of the important activities and legitimate role of women human rights defenders and the communities of which they are a part or on whose behalf they work, as well as avoiding impediments, obstructions, restrictions or selective enforcement thereof contrary to international human rights law, Recalling that the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms rests with the State, and reaffirming that national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and other international obligations of the State in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms is the juridical framework within which human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, conduct their activities, Gravely concerned that, in some instances, national security and counter- terrorism legislation and other measures, such as laws regulating civil society organizations, have been misused to target human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, or have hindered their work and endangered their safety in a manner contrary to international law, Recognizing the urgent need to address, and to take concrete steps to prevent and stop, the use of legislation to hinder or limit unduly the ability of human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders, to exercise their work, including by reviewing and, where necessary, amending relevant legislation and its implementation in order to ensure compliance with international human rights law, 3/7 Underlining the need for all appropriate measures to be taken to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women, in accordance with international human rights law, thereby addressing harmful attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that underlie and perpetuate violence against women, including women human rights defenders, Reaffirming that the empowerment, autonomy and advancement of women and the improvement of their political, social, legal and economic status are essential to respect for all human rights, the growth and prosperity of society and the achievement of representative, transparent and accountable government, democratic institutions and sustainable development in all areas of

asset recovery is an integral part of the Convention, Recalling also article 51 of the Convention obligating States parties to afford one another the widest measure of cooperation and assistance with regard to asset return, Reiterating the concern about the seriousness of problems and threats posed by corruption to the stability and security of societies, undermining the institutions and values of

out in chapter V of the Convention in order to prevent, detect, deter and recover in a more effective manner the international transfer of proceeds of crime and to strengthen international cooperation

recommendations of the Working Group, acknowledging the continued relevance of resolutions 2/3, 3/3 and 4/4, and noting with interest the background paper prepared by the Secretariat on the progress made in the implementation of those recommendations, Recognizing that those who engage in corrupt acts, whether natural or legal persons, consistent with domestic law and the requirements of the Convention, should be held accountable and prosecuted by their domestic authorities, and that all efforts should be made to conduct a financial investigation into assets illegally acquired by them and to recover the same through domestic confiscation proceedings, international cooperation for purposes of confiscation, or appropriate direct recovery measures, Concerned about the difficulties, particularly the legal and _ practical difficulties, that both requested and requesting States face in asset recovery, taking into account the particular importance of the recovery of stolen assets for sustainable development and stability, and noting the difficulties of providing information establishing a link between the proceeds of corruption in the requested State and the crime committed in the requesting State, which in many cases can be difficult to prove, Recognizing the common difficulties experienced by States parties in establishing a nexus between identified assets and the crime from which such assets are derived, and emphasizing the critical importance of effective domestic investigative efforts and international cooperation to overcome such difficulties, Recalling article 56 of the Convention encouraging each State party to endeavour to take measures to permit it to forward, without prejudice to its own investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings, information on proceeds of offences established in accordance with the Convention to another State party without prior request, when it considers that the disclosure of such information might assist the receiving State party in initiating or carrying out investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings or might lead to a request by that State party under chapter V of the Convention, Noting the right of the requested State party under article 57, paragraph 4, of the Convention to deduct reasonable expenses incurred in_ investigations, prosecutions or judicial proceedings leading to the return or disposal of confiscated property, and noting the mutual benefit to both requested and requesting States when such expenses are reasonable, Encouraging States parties to make full use of the asset recovery tools set forth in chapter V of the Convention, including mechanisms for assistance in the enforcement of foreign restraining and confiscation orders, as a means to significantly reduce expenses that a jurisdiction normally might incur in pursuing asset recovery, Noting proactive efforts made by some States parties to sanction their domestic entities for offences specified in the Convention, through both confiscation and monetary sanctions or other legal mechanisms, and acknowledging the benefits of V.13-88269 CAC/COSP/2013/L.11/Rev.1 early and proactive information sharing, consistent with domestic law and the requirements of the Convention, in furthering enforcement, Recognizing the critical importance of effective international cooperation in efforts to combat corruption, particularly with respect to offences specified in the Convention with a transnational element, and encouraging continued cooperation by States parties, consistent with the requirements of the Convention, in all efforts to investigate and prosecute natural and legal persons, including the use of other legal mechanisms, where appropriate, for specified offences in the Convention and recover assets related to the same, consistent with chapter V of the Convention, Calling upon all States parties and, in particular, requested and requesting States, to cooperate to recover the proceeds of corruption and demonstrate strong commitment to ensure the return or disposal of the same in accordance with article 57 of the Convention, Encouraging requested States parties to respond to requests for assistance pursuant to article 46 of the Convention in the absence of dual criminality, Noting the efforts made by all States parties in tracing, freezing and recovering their stolen assets, and underlining the need to redouble efforts to assist in the recovery of those assets in order to preserve stability and sustainable development, Noting also the work of other initiatives in asset recovery, such as the Arab Forum on Asset Recovery, and welcomes efforts to enhance cooperation between requesting and requested States, Taking note of the Lausanne process initiative on practical guidelines for efficient asset recovery, which is being undertaken with a view to identifying good practices in effective and coordinated approaches to asset recovery for practitioners from requesting and requested States, with the support of interested States, implemented in close collaboration with the International Centre for Asset Recovery and with the support of the World Bank/United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, Recognizing that States parties continue to face challenges in recovering assets owing to differences between legal systems, the complexity of multijurisdictional investigations and prosecutions, the limited implementation of effective domestic tools such as non-conviction-based forfeiture for asset recovery, as well as other administrative or civil procedures leading to confiscation, lack of familiarity with the mutual legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow of corruption proceeds, and noting the particular challenges posed in recovering the proceeds of corruption in cases involving individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions, as well as their family members and close associates, Noting the responsibility of requesting and requested States parties to cooperate to ensure that a greater proportion of the proceeds emanating from corruption are recovered, returned or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, Acknowledging the vital importance of ensuring the independence and effectiveness of authorities charged with investigating and prosecuting corruption V.13-88269 CAC/COSP/2013/L.11/Rev.1 crimes and of recovering the proceeds of such crimes by several means, such as establishing the necessary legal framework and allocating the necessary resources, Concerned that some persons accused of crimes of corruption have managed to escape justice and thus have eluded the legal consequences of their actions, and have been successful in hiding their assets, Taking into account the need to hold corrupt officials accountable by depriving them of their stolen assets, Stressing the critical importance of mobilizing political will for effective implementation of chapter V of the Convention, Calling upon all States parties, acting as both requested and requesting States, to continue to commit the political will to act together to recover the proceeds of corruption and to work together to overcome obstacles to effective asset recovery, Determined to prevent, detect and deter in a
