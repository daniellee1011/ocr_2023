Recognizes the interlinkages between poverty, malnutrition, lack of or inadequate or inaccessible health services, early childbearing, early marriage of the girl child and gender discrimination as root causes of obstetric fistula, and that poverty remains the main social risk factor, that the eradication of poverty is critical to meeting the needs and protecting and promoting the rights of girls and that continued urgent national and international action is required to eliminate it; 2. Stresses the need to address the social issues that contribute to the problem of obstetric fistula, such as early marriage of the girl child, early pregnancy, lack of access to sexual and reproductive health, lack of or inadequate education of girls, poverty and low status of women and girls; 3. Also stresses that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and that they must exercise due diligence in order to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms; 4. Calls upon States to take all necessary measures to ensure the rights of women and girls to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health, and develop sustainable health systems and social services, with a view to ensuring access to such systems and services without discrimination, while paying special attention to adequate food and nutrition, family planning information, increasing knowledge and awareness and securing appropriate prenatal and post-natal care for the prevention of obstetric fistula; 5. Also calls upon States to ensure that girls have equal access to free and compulsory primary education of good quality, and that they complete their education at that level, and to renew their efforts to improve and expand girls’ and women’s education at all levels, including at secondary and higher levels, as well as vocational education and technical training, in order to, inter alia, achieve gender equality, the empowerment of women and poverty eradication; 6. Urges States to enact and strictly enforce laws to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses and, in addition, to enact and strictly enforce laws concerning the minimum legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage, and to raise the minimum age for matriage where necessary; 7.

Calls upon the international community to support the activities of the United Nations Population Fund and other partners in the Campaign to End Fistula, including the World Health Organization, in establishing and financing regional fistula treatment and training centres through identifying and supporting health facilities that have the potential to serve as centres for treatment, training and convalescent care; A/C.3/62/L.21/Rev.1 9. Encourages communication and networking among existing fistula centres to facilitate training, research, advocacy and fund-raising and the development and application of relevant standards, including Obstetric Fistula: Guiding Principles for Clinical Management and Programming Development of the World Health Organization,!° which provides background information along with principles for developing fistula prevention and treatment strategies and programmes; 10.
