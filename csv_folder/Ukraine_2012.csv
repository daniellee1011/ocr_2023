The Central European Initiative (CEI) was granted observer status by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/111 of 9 December 2011. Cooperation between the Central European Initiative and other major international organizations and institutions 2. The Initiative endeavours to cooperate with all major international organizations and institutions. It cooperates with the United Nations system and other relevant international organizations, in particular the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as well as with international financial institutions, especially the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. It also cooperates with the European Union, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other regional cooperation initiatives on areas of mutual interest. Relations with the United Nations 3. The Initiative cooperates with a number of United Nations specialized entities, namely the Economic Commission for Europe in the area of enterprise development, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in the area of science and technology. Economic Commission for Europe 4. The Initiative’s cooperation with the Economic Commission for Europe, which dates back to 1998 when a memorandum of understanding was signed, should be underlined. The cooperation, especially in the field of small- and medium-sized enterprises, resulted in the publication of Through the Looking Glass 2000-2001: A Handbook for Investors in CEI Regions, which was presented for the first time on the occasion of the Summit Economic Forum in 2000. The Commission and the Initiative continued their cooperation during the following two years, when Investiguide 2001-2002: Project Opportunities and Contacts for the CEI Region and Investiguide 2002-2003 were published. From 1999 to 2003, annual meetings on cooperation between the two bodies were held in Geneva, back to back with a meeting of the Committee of National Coordinators, with the aim of analysing areas of common support and identifying common projects and activities. In the following years, the Initiative was able to better focus its areas of activity, including with respect to its cooperation with the various international and regional organizations. Recent efforts have been made to relaunch cooperation with the Commission within the framework of the existing memorandum of understanding. A/67/232 United Nations Environment Programme 5. Cooperation between the Initiative and UNEP is structured by means of a memorandum of understanding between the Initiative and the UNEP Vienna office/Interim Secretariat of the Carpathian Convention, signed in Kyiv on 13 December 2006, on the occasion of the First Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Carpathian Convention. The Initiative and UNEP Vienna had been cooperating on the European Union-funded Carpathian Project, aimed at enhancing the protection and sustainable development of the exceptional natural and cultural heritage of the Carpathian region. In accordance with the memorandum of understanding, special attention is paid to such issues of mutual concern as environmental protection, infrastructure, agriculture and tourism. The Initiative actively participates in events and meetings organized within the framework of the Carpathian Convention, and especially the Conferences of the Parties. At the project level, the Initiative supports seminars and workshops organized in cooperation with UNEP. World Tourism Organization 6. UNWTO is a key partner in the promotion of international cooperation on tourism, tourism being an important sector for the economic development of the countries in the Initiative region. UNWTO representatives participate in the Initiative’s high-level meetings and ministerial meetings on tourism. At the same time, the Initiative takes part in the UNWTO Commission for Europe meetings. The Initiative and UNWTO jointly support numerous projects, meetings and events in the countries of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, and UNWTO experts often provide their expertise at the Initiative’s seminars and conferences. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 7. The Initiative also enjoys fruitful cooperation with FAO, primarily at the project level. The Initiative’s main counterpart at FAO is the Technical Cooperation Department and its Investment Centre division. Through its trust fund at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Initiative has financed several technical cooperation projects carried out by FAO experts in Central and Eastern Europe. The most successful projects included support for the development of fresh produce wholesale terminals and the establishment of the Initiative’s Wholesale Markets Foundation and the EastAgri network, a platform of financial institutions investing in agribusiness and agriculture in the Initiative region and beyond. Ongoing collaboration includes smaller-scale projects aimed at transferring specific know-how in the area of agriculture from European Union to non-European Union States members of the Initiative. European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 8. The Initiative maintains an office at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which is responsible for the management of the Initiative trust fund and is entirely funded by the Government of Italy. It is located within the Operational Policies department of the Bank. Through this office, the Initiative has managed to build a special comparative advantage vis-a-vis other funds active within the Bank. The cooperation also grants the Initiative higher visibility and allows it to develop better coordination and successful partnerships. A/67/232 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 9. Cooperation with OECD dates back to 2002. Both OECD and the Initiative have benefited throughout the years from their mutual cooperation in terms of the increased impact and effectiveness of their respective programmes and the faster attainment of their common objectives, specifically in the areas of the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises, cross-border cooperation and local development. The results of that cooperation have been presented at several political and economic Initiative Summit meetings. Council of Europe and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 10. In the area of institution-building and human resource development (culture, education, minorities, combating organized crime and cross-border cooperation), the Initiative has found strong partners with expert knowledge in a number of specialized organizations such as the Council of Europe and OSCE. Its cooperation with the Council has been strengthened even further in the last few years. The possibility of initiating project-oriented cooperation that could enhance the respective assets and efforts, especially in relation to certain geographical areas and sectors of activity of common interest, has been thoroughly examined. An exchange of information on relevant programmes and activities has resulted in several concrete cooperation proposals. 11. In addition to the organizations mentioned above, the Initiative also works in close cooperation with several regional organizations and forums operating within and beyond the Initiative region: the Adriatic and Ionian Initiative, the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the Regional Cooperation Council and the South-East European Cooperation Process. Regional Cooperation Council 12. Cooperation with the Regional Cooperation Council dates back to 2008, when the Council was established. The initial contacts were undertaken on the occasion of a coordination meeting organized by the Council on 31 March 2008. Throughout the years, coordination meetings have provided an excellent opportunity for establishing contacts at the bilateral and trilateral levels. Cooperation with the Council was further strengthened through a memorandum of understanding signed on 12 May 2009 in Sarajevo. The highlight of the cooperation is the Sustainable Energy Development Regional Initiative, the first joint project between the Initiative and the Council. The Sustainable Energy Development Regional Initiative represents a concrete coordination effort by the two organizations to launch joint actions in the area of sustainable energy development by combining their complementary approaches in order to maximize the benefits for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 13. Cooperation with the Organization dates back to 1997 and was enhanced when a memorandum of understanding was signed in Istanbul, Turkey, on 7 March 2011. The initial steps towards the memorandum were taken during a number of ad hoc consultations between these two oldest and most experienced regional forums. A number of areas of collaboration were identified, including the environment, energy, transport, agriculture and science and technology. The memorandum is expected to A/67/232 provide a general framework for the coordination of the activities of the two organizations on a regular basis and for strengthening their relations, with the aim of enhancing cooperation and synergizing efforts regarding issues of common interest. It is also a guarantee that duplication will be avoided. Adriatic and Ionian Initiative 14. To date, cooperation with the Adriatic and Ionian Initiative has mainly focused on education in the context of the Central European Initiative’s University Network and UniAdrion (a university network within the framework of the Adriatic and Ionian Initiative). Nevertheless, a number of initiatives and activities in other areas have been undertaken by the two organizations, including mutual participation in high-level and expert meetings. Reasons for including a sub-item entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the Central European Initiative” under the item entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and regional and other organizations” 15. The reasons for including a sub-item entitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and the Central European Initiative” in the agenda of the sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly are listed below. 16. The Central European Initiative is the oldest and largest forum for regional cooperation in Europe (18 member States) and includes a territory of approximately 2.4 million km* and a population of more than 250 million. It was initially established to give a clear sign that the blocs that had existed in Europe for so long were being overcome through, inter alia, the re-establishment of cooperation links in a subregional context among countries of different political orientation. Throughout its existence, the Initiative has worked hard to establish cohesion and solidarity among its member States. In fact, it has undergone a transformation from being predominantly oriented towards policy dialogue to emphasizing the transfer of know-how and technology and promoting climate and energy sustainability and civil society, especially in the fields of scientific research, education, culture and media. 17. The building of symbolic and actual bridges across the former (or still existing) dividing lines of Europe can benefit the “underprivileged countries” only if it is accompanied by jobs creation, the strengthening of social and economic systems and an increased focus on the perspective of young people. In that context, the Initiative is seeking out and closely cooperating with all global, European and regional actors. The final aim is to achieve a concrete, positive impact on the lives of the people. 18. The Initiative tries to do its part by using the structures developed in its almost 23 years of existence, its position within the Governments of the 18 member States and its own funds to develop and co-finance concrete projects in its member countries. The range of opportunities is an important advantage which, if combined with the experience and resources of other international organizations, can have an even stronger impact. 19. A number of the Initiative’s priorities are in line with the Millennium Development Goals, in particular those linked to universal education, gender equality, environmental sustainability and global partnership. The Initiative’s activities in those fields include the following: A/67/232 (a) Universal education. The Initiative’s cooperation in the field of human resource development and education is focused on activities aimed at promoting employability through education and training, on the concept of lifelong learning and its implementation and on education through the further development of its University Network. These issues are of particular importance today. In this context, the Initiative contributes by identifying means and methods of integrating specific “sensitive” groups (children, women, underqualified people, high school graduates, the long-term unemployed, immigrants, the disabled) into the labour market through education and training. The development of successful approaches (methods, programmes, initiatives and projects) to enhance the education of children and adults through the exchange of experiences and good practices is among the Initiative’s priorities; (b) Gender equality. The Initiative supports the promotion of women in all areas of society. It has always aimed to better understand women entrepreneurship in its member countries by analysing the importance of social innovation as part of the entrepreneurial process and to propose concrete recommendations to support socially innovative programmes and policies for women entrepreneurs. It has supported a number of programmes and projects to that end; (c) Environmental sustainability. The Initiative is in tune with such major global issues as climate change, environmental protection, increased energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. In that context, all actors ought to find win-win solutions. The Initiative also recognizes the importance of both energy and environmental protection as an essential element for sustainable development. It enhances cooperation in those fields among its member countries, thus contributing to global energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. It does that by providing a framework for consultations and the sharing of knowledge about strategies and policies among its member States and for the implementation of activities and projects; (d) Global partnership. The successful implementation of the Initiative’s goals and objectives depends to a large degree on the partnership it has established with the United Nations and all other international organizations and international financial institutions, as well as with the Governments, other institutions and civil society organizations of its member States. Those partnerships continue to be further developed and strengthened. The Initiative and its partners will continue to help to deliver development programmes and projects to those who have the greatest need for accelerated economic development or recovery, which is one of the Initiative’s strategic goals. 20. Through its various funds and instruments of cooperation, the Initiative has financed and supported projects on a number of other issues that are in line with the Millennium Development Goals, such as combating poverty, and improving child and maternal health.

which acknowledges difficulty in providing detailed information related to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and dumping off Somalia’s coast without adequate monitoring or reporting systems, and states that the United Nations has received little evidence to date to justify claims that illegal fishing and dumping are factors responsible for forcing Somali youths to resort to

UNPOS in the use of public information tools to raise awareness of the dangers of piracy, highlight the best practices to eradicate this criminal phenomenon, and inform the public of the dangers posed by piracy, Further noting with appreciation the ongoing efforts by UNODC and UNDP to support efforts to enhance the capacity of the corrections system in Somalia, including regional authorities

developmental potential and to participate in society, Recognizing the important contribution that non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors can make in promoting human rights for persons with disabilities, including all individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), developmental disorders (DD) and associated disabilities, and their integration in societies, as well as addressing the socioeconomic needs of their families and communities, Reaffirming the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for persons with disabilities to be guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, Affirming that ensuring and promoting the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, without distinction, is critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, Recalling its resolution 66/124 of 19 December 2011, by which it decided to convene a one-day high-level meeting of the General Assembly, on 23 September 2013, with the overarching theme “The way forward: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond”, which shall be funded within existing resources, in order to strengthen efforts to ensure accessibility for and the inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development efforts, Aware that autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects the functioning of the brain, characterized by impairments in social interaction, problems with verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted, repetitive behaviour, interests and activities, Aware also that the vast variety of needs of individuals with ASD, DD and associated disabilities poses a substantial challenge to addressing the disability and providing the appropriate services for treatment and care by Government and non-governmental organizations, Deeply concerned that children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities in all regions of the world experience challenges in accessing long-term health care, education, training and intervention programmes undertaken by Governments, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, Concerned also that those persons with ASD, DD and associated disabilities continue to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society, and reaffirming that discrimination against any person on the basis of disability is a violation of the inherent dignity and worth of the human person, Recalling that early diagnosis, appropriate research and effective interventions are vital to the growth and development of the individual, and emphasizing that early intervention is crucial for addressing the needs of the individual with ASD, DD and associated disabilities, thus improving the opportunities to live a quality life A/67/L.33 with the ability to participate in the greater community and increasing the

World Health Assembly, requesting the Director General of the World Health Organization to develop a comprehensive mental health action plan, for consideration by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly, ® Recognizing that a major barrier to improving the health and well-being of children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities and their families is the paucity of knowledge and expertise to recognize symptoms and identify ASD, and also recognizing that the absence of effective routine screening that allows for early detection, in turn, limits access to care and early interventions and that, without research to develop and implement effective programmes, the emergence of appropriate solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families does not occur, Acknowledging efforts to increase awareness of the rights of those affected by ASD, DD and associated disabilities, including the commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day, which led to
