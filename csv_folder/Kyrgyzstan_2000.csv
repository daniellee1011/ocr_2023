and its respect for Afghanistan’s cultural and historical heritage, Recognizing the critical humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, Supporting the efforts of the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan to advance a peace process through political negotiations between the Afghan parties aimed at the establishment of a broad-based, multi-ethnic, and fully representative government, and calling for the warring factions to cooperate fully with those efforts to conclude a ceasefire and begin discussions leading to a political settlement, by moving forward promptly in the process of dialogue to which they have committed themselves, Noting the December 2000 meeting of the Afghan Support Group which emphasized that the situation in Afghanistan is a complex one that requires a comprehensive, integrated approach to a peace process and issues of narcotics trafficking, terrorism, human rights, and international humanitarian and development aid, Recalling the relevant international counter-terrorism conventions and in particular the obligations of parties to those conventions to extradite or prosecute terrorists, Strongly condemning the continuing use of the areas of Afghanistan under the control of the Afghan faction known as Taliban, which also calls itself the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (hereinafter known as the Taliban), for the sheltering and training of terrorists and planning of terrorist acts, and reaffirming its conviction that the suppression of international terrorism is essential for the maintenance of international peace and security, Noting the importance of the Taliban acting in accordance with the 1961 Single Convention, the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, and the commitments of the 1998 Twentieth Special Session of the General S/2000/1202 Assembly on Narcotic Drugs, including to
