to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication, Reiterating, as in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later, that food should not be used as an instrument of political or economic pressure, and reaffirming in this regard the importance of international cooperation and solidarity, as well as the necessity of

Summit Plan of Action and, at the same time, cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made, the problems of hunger and food insecurity have a global dimension and that there has been insufficient progress made on reducing hunger, and that they could increase dramatically in some regions unless urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, Concerned by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis are not over and that they continue to have serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, Convinced that the elimination of the current distortions in the agricultural trading system will allow local producers and poor farmers to compete and sell their products, thereby facilitating the realization of the right to adequate food, Noting that environmental degradation, desertification and global

relevant sources for the realization of the right to food, Recalling its resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights Council, and 5/2 on a code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council, of 18 June 2007, 1.

Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases, and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where it contributes to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership, as well as full and equal access to education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families; 7.

Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands and, in this regard, calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa; 17. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face to the full enjoyment of the right to food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 18.

Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 22. Encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue to cooperate with States in order to enhance the contribution development cooperation and food aid to the realization of the right to food, within existing mechanisms, taking into account the views of all stakeholders; 23.

Calls upon States to enact and, where necessary, reinforce or amend domestic legislation and take measures to enhance the protection of women and girls who have experienced violence, to criminalize such violence, to investigate, prosecute, punish and redress, including by ensuring access to adequate, effective, prompt and appropriate remedies, including reparations, the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence, whether in the home, the workplace, the community or society, in custody or in situations of armed conflict, to ensure that such legislation conforms with relevant intemational human rights instruments and international humanitarian law, to abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against women, and to remove gender bias in the administration of justice; 3.

Calls upon States to publicly condemn violence against women and provide visible and sustained leadership at the highest levels to prevent all forms of violence against women and girls, and, in particular, in efforts to confront the attitudes, customs, practices and gender stereotypes that lie at the core of discriminatory and harmful acts and practices that are violent towards women, such as female genital mutilation, forced and early marriage, femicide and crimes committed in the name of honour; 8. Also calls upon States to support initiatives undertaken by women’s groups, intemational and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, media, faith and community groups and other relevant civil society actors aimed at promoting gender A/HRC/14/L.9/Rev.1 equality and the full enjoyment of all human rights by women and girls, and raising awareness of and preventing violence against women and girls; 9.

Urges States to enhance efforts to involve men and boys in initiatives to prevent violence against women and in highlighting the unacceptability of violence against women; 13.

Calls upon States to strengthen initiatives that would increase the capacity of women and adolescent girls to protect themselves from HIV infection, including by providing HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services, to ensure protection from and prevention of stigma and discrimination, and to cooperate with United Nations bodies, programmes and specialized agencies and international and non- governmental organizations in this regard; 15.

commitment to literacy, reinforcing effective literacy programme delivery and harnessing new resources for literacy, Recognizing the importance of removing barriers, outside and within education systems, so as to provide equitable educational and learning opportunities for all children, Reaffirming the right of indigenous peoples to have non-discriminatory access to all levels and forms of

Country review 12. The Mechanism shall be applicable to all States parties. It shall gradually cover the implementation of the entire Convention and its Protocols. 13. The review of all States that are parties to the Convention at the start of a review cycle should be completed before a new review cycle begins. In exceptional cases, however, the Conference may decide to launch a new review cycle before the completion of all reviews of the previous cycle. No State party shall undergo a review twice in the same review cycle, without prejudice to the right of a State party to provide new information. In the review cycle, review of a State party’s implementation should include that State’s implementation of the Convention and all the Protocols thereto to which it is a party. In order to organize the reviews, the review cycles should cover applicable thematic areas of the Convention and its Protocols. 14. The number of States parties from each regional group participating in the review process in a given year shall be proportionate to the size of that regional group and the number of its members that are States parties to the Convention. The selection of States parties participating in the review process in a given year of a review cycle shall be carried out by the drawing of lots at the beginning of each review cycle. A State party selected for review in a given year may, with a reasonable justification, defer participation to the following year of the review cycle. 15. Each State party shall provide to the secretariat the information required by the Conference on its compliance with and implementation of the Convention and its Protocols, as applicable, using the comprehensive self-assessment checklist as an initial step for that purpose. States parties shall provide complete, up-to-date, accurate and timely responses. 16.

Conduct of the country review 18. Each State party to the Convention shall be reviewed by two other States parties to the Convention. The review process shall actively involve the State party under review. 18 bis. Regarding the review of the Protocols to the Convention, the reviewing States parties must be parties to the Protocols to which the State under review is a party. However, reviewing States parties may be parties to more Protocols to the Convention than is the State under review. 19. One of the two reviewing States parties shall be from the same geographical region as the State party under review and shall, if possible, be a State with a legal system similar to that of the State party under review. The selection of the reviewing States parties shall be carried out by the drawing of lots at the beginning of each year of the cycle, with the understanding that States parties shall not undertake mutual reviews. The State party under review may request, a maximum of two times, that the drawing of lots be repeated. In exceptional circumstances, the drawing of lots may be repeated more than twice. 20. A State party under review may defer serving as a reviewing State party that same year. That same principle, mutatis mutandis, shall apply to the reviewing States parties.

Throughout the review process, governmental experts and the secretariat shall be guided by the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the terms of reference of the Mechanism for the Review of Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 2. In particular, governmental experts shall bear in mind article 4, paragraph 1, of the Convention, which states that States parties shall carry out their obligations under the Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States. 3. Furthermore, governmental experts shall carry out the reviews in full recognition of the purpose of the review process as specified in paragraph 11 of the terms of reference. 4. During all interactions within the review process, governmental experts shall respect the collective approach. Governmental experts are expected to act with courtesy and diplomacy, and shall remain objective and impartial. Governmental experts need to be flexible in their approach and ready to adapt to changes in schedules. 5. Governmental experts and the secretariat shall maintain the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of, or used in, the country review process, as well as the country review report, as stipulated in the terms of reference. If there are serious grounds for believing that a governmental expert or a member of the secretariat has violated the obligation of confidentiality, the States parties concerned or the secretariat may inform the Implementation Oversight Group for appropriate consideration and action, including referring the matter to the Conference. 6. It is also expected that governmental experts are not to be influenced in their assessment of the implementation of the Convention. While information generated through competent regional and international organizations of which the State party under review is a member and whose mandates cover issues relevant to the review of the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols is to be taken into account, governmental experts shall make their own analysis of the facts provided by the State party under review in order to present findings that are in line with all the specific requirements of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto under review. 7. Throughout the review process, governmental experts are encouraged to contact the secretariat for any assistance required. 15 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6/Rev.1 II. Specific guidance for the conduct of the review 8. In accordance with the terms of reference and consistent with the importance of ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the review process, reviews shall be conducted in a spirit of constructive collaboration, dialogue and mutual trust. 9. States parties and the secretariat shall endeavour to adhere to the indicative timelines set out in the paragraphs below. 10. The governmental experts shall prepare themselves by: (a) Studying thoroughly the Convention and the terms of reference of the Mechanism, including the present guidelines; (b) Familiarizing themselves with the Legislative Guide for the Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime? as well as the Travaux Préparatoires of the Negotiations for the Elaboration of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto,® particularly those parts pertaining to the articles that are the subject of the relevant review cycle; (c) Reviewing the responses provided by the State party under review in its comprehensive self-assessment checklist and supplementary documentation and familiarizing themselves with the issues addressed by the State party under review; (d) Informing the secretariat if additional information and material are required and highlighting issues requiring further clarification. 11. The Secretariat shall organize periodic training courses for governmental experts who participate in the review process, so that they can familiarize themselves with the guidelines and increase their capacity to participate in the review process. 12.

The State party under review shall, within two months of being officially informed of the beginning of the conduct of the country review, provide to the secretariat the information required on its compliance with and implementation of the Convention, using the comprehensive self-assessment checklist as an initial step for that purpose. Assistance in the preparation of the responses shall be provided by the secretariat to the State party requesting such assistance. The secretariat shall, within one month of the receipt of the checklist response, submit that response for translation and circulate it to the governmental experts. 16. Within one month after the State party under review has been officially informed about the beginning of the conduct of the country review, governmental experts shall participate in a telephone conference or videoconference, to be organized by the secretariat for the purpose of an initial introduction of the reviewing States parties, the State party under review and the staff member of the secretariat assigned to the country review, as well as for general orientation, including a review of the schedule and requirements established for the review. 17. Governmental experts from reviewing States parties shall take a decision on how to divide tasks and issues among themselves, taking into account their respective fields of competence. 18. While governmental experts shall establish open lines of communication with the State party under review, the experts shall keep the secretariat abreast of all these communications. 19. Throughout the process, the governmental experts shall appropriately consider the information and material provided by the State party under review through the different means of communication as described in the terms of reference. 20. When seeking additional information and asking for clarification, governmental experts shall bear in mind the non-adversarial, non-intrusive and non- punitive character of the review and the overall goal of assisting the State party under review to reach full implementation of the Convention. 21. Within one month of the receipt of the response to the comprehensive self- assessment checklist and any supplementary information provided by the State party under review, governmental experts shall submit to the secretariat the outcome of the desk review, including requests for clarifications, additional information or supplementary questions, to be translated into the designated languages of the review and provided to the State party under review. 22.

During the conference call, governmental experts from the reviewing States parties shall introduce their parts of the desk review and explain the findings. The ensuing dialogue shall ideally last up to two months and consist of requests for additional information or specific questions from the governmental experts, to 17 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6/Rev.1 which the State party under review shall respond, using various means of dialogue including conference calls, videoconferences, e-mail exchanges or further means of direct dialogue as mentioned in paragraph 24 of the terms of reference and as specified below. 24. If agreed by the State party under review, the desk review should be complemented by any further means of direct dialogue, such as a country visit or a joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. The country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna shall be planned and organized by the State party under review. While the secretariat will facilitate all practical arrangements, governmental experts shall take all necessary measures from their side to participate in the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, bearing in mind paragraph 29 of the terms of reference. 25. During the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna, governmental experts shall uphold the principles and standards outlined in the general guidance above. 26. Governmental experts are expected to actively and constructively participate in all meetings, including at internal debriefings at the end of each working day, or at the end of the country visit or joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 27. Governmental experts are expected to be respectful and courteous in meetings, respecting time frames set in the programme and allowing time for all members to participate. At the same time, governmental experts are expected to be flexible, as the programme may change during the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 28. Questions should seek to complement information already provided by the State party under review and relate only to the review process. Governmental experts shall therefore remain neutral and not voice personal opinions during the meetings. 29. Governmental experts are expected to take notes during all meetings, which they can refer to for the production of the final country review report. They shall share their opinions and preliminary findings in writing among themselves and with the secretariat within two weeks after the country visit or the joint meeting at the United Nations Office at Vienna. 30. At the final stage of the country review process and preferably within five months of the beginning of the review, based on the blueprint format, the governmental experts shall, with the assistance of the secretariat, prepare a country review report and send it to the State party under review in the designated language of the review. The report shall identify successes, good practices and challenges and make observations for the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. Where appropriate, the report shall include the identification of technical assistance needs for the purpose of improving implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. The comments of the State party under review shall be incorporated into the country review report. 31. Governmental experts shall include observations with respect to the implementation in national law of the articles of the Convention and its Protocols under review, as well as their application in practice. 18 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6/Rev.1 32. Governmental experts shall further identify successes and good practices and challenges and make observations with respect to the implementation of the articles of the Convention and its Protocols under review, as well as areas where technical assistance may be required. 33. At the request of the State party under review and as required, governmental experts may also be asked to provide the State party under review with explanations of how to address the challenges identified so as to allow the State party to fully and effectively implement the relevant articles of the Convention and its Protocols. 34. The secretariat shall send the country review report to the State party under review for its agreement. In case of disagreement, there shall be a dialogue between the State party under review and the governmental experts to arrive at a consensual final report. An executive summary shall subsequently be prepared and agreed on. 19 CTOC/COP/2010/L.6/Rev.1 Appendix IT Blueprint for country review reports and executive summaries Review by [names of reviewing States| of the implementation by [name of State under review] of article(s) [number(s) of articles| of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [and articles [numbers] of the Protocols thereto| for the review cycle [time frame] Introduction 1.
