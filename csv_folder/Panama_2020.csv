Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, A/HRC/45/L.48 Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, or primary caregivers and legal guardians, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, A/HRC/45/L.48 Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous chemicals throughout their life cycle and the safe disposal of wastes, the disclosure of information and improved and affordable water, sanitation and hygiene, 1.

States parties to pursue the full implementation of the rights of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by taking measures to, inter alia, combat disease and malnutrition, including through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution, and that States parties have agreed that the education of the child shall be directed to, among others, the development of respect for the natural environment, Recalling the 2016 Day of General Discussion of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, which focused on the contents and the implications of the Convention on the Rights of the Child with regard to environmental matters, and taking note of its outcome report and recommendations, Welcoming the attention paid by the special procedures of the Human Rights Council to the rights of the child in the context of their respective mandates, in

Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, as well as the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed conflict, and notes with appreciation their most recent reports submitted to the Council, Recalling General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which the Assembly adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching, indivisible and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, and the commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner and to realizing the human rights of all, leaving no one behind and reaching those furthest behind first, and recognizing that the realization of the rights of the child through a healthy environment is crucial to achieving the goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, namely human rights for all, well-being and a sustainable planet, Noting the Secretary-General’s “A Call to Action for Human Rights”, which calls for, inter alia, creating space for young people to participate in shaping the decisions that will affect their future, including but not limited to environmental protection, protecting human rights defenders and environmental activists, particularly young people, women and girls, and raising awareness and enhancing education that prepares young people for the future they face, including climate change-related curricula at all levels of primary and secondary education, Reaffirming that States have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, including in all actions undertaken to address environmental harm, such as loss of biodiversity, climate change, pollution and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and to take measures to protect the rights of all, including the rights of the child, and that additional measures for those who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental harm should be taken, Recalling States’ obligations and commitments under multilateral environmental instruments and agreements, including on climate change, Recalling also that article 2, paragraph 2 of the Paris Agreement states that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 circumstances, while stressing that the principle does not apply to States’ human rights obligations, Profoundly concerned that children in many parts of the world remain negatively affected by the adverse impact of environmental harm, including climate change, persistent drought and extreme weather events, environmental disasters, land degradation, sea level rise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification, Expressing concern that millions of children worldwide continue to grow up deprived of parental care, separated from their families for many reasons, including due to natural disasters, the adverse impact of climate change and different forms of environmental harm, Reaffirming that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, that the best interests of the child shall be the guiding principle of those responsible for his or her nurture and protection, and that families’ and caregivers’ capacities to provide the child with care and a safe environment should be promoted, including in the context of natural disasters, the adverse impacts of climate change or other forms of environmental harm, Recognizing the particular vulnerability of children, due to their unique metabolism, physiology and developmental needs, to the effects of environmental harm, especially to pollution of the air, soil and water, and exposure to hazardous substances and wastes, and that exposure to those effects can have a lifelong impact on children, as their health outcomes, well-being and development are compromised from early age, Deeply concerned that, each year, more than 1.7 million children under the age of 5 lose their lives as a result of avoidable exposure to the effects of environmental harm, while 12 million children in developing countries experience permanent brain damage due to lead poisoning and approximately 85 million children worldwide work in hazardous conditions and are regularly exposed to toxic substances, which cause brain damage and disease and an array of other forms of harm, some of which can result in irreversible and lifelong effects, such as impairment, Recognizing that environmental harm, including climate change, exacerbates environmental disasters, which can deprive affected persons of essential livelihoods and generate displacement and migration, including of unaccompanied children and young persons, Deeply concerned that the effects of environmental harm may undermine the full enjoyment of a vast range of the rights of the child, inter alia the right to life, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to a standard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the right to education, the right of the child to be cared for by his or her parents, the right to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities, and the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, Recognizing that close interlinkages exist between intersecting forms of discrimination and the inequalities faced by children and their level of exposure to the effects of environmental harm, and the unequal exposure to environmental health risks across countries and regions, with a higher burden in developing countries, Recognizing also that girls may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm, inter alia concerning the enjoyment of their rights to education and to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, and stressing the importance of protecting them from violence, exploitation and harmful practices, including, inter alia, child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, and of ensuring their full, equal and meaningful participation in decision-making affecting their lives, Recalling that discrimination against girls violates the principle of equality, and that all measures designed and implemented to prevent and address environmental harm should A/HRC/45/L.48/Rev.1 adhere to the principles of substantive equality and non-discrimination, including by taking into account and addressing pre-existing gender inequalities, Recognizing that children with disabilities may be disproportionately affected by the effects of environmental harm and that specific measures may be required to ensure their protection and safety on an equal basis with others, while recognizing also the need to support the participation and inclusion of children with disabilities, and their representative organizations, in the development of and decision-making processes relating to such measures, Recalling that every child has the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which includes States taking measures to combat and prevent disease and its impact on health and ensuring access to health-care services, and inter alia preventing and reducing exposure to harmful substances or environmental conditions that directly or indirectly affect their health, Expressing concern that epidemics and pandemics, and the unintended consequences of public health measures to combat them, can undermine the rights of the child, especially of children that are already in a vulnerable situation due to environmental harm, while underscoring that a healthy environment is an effective way to prevent epidemics and pandemics and to protect human rights, including the rights of the child, Expressing concern also that children continue to be exposed to pollution, waste and hazardous substances, whether on their own or in mixtures, including through secondary products and processes related to business and industrial activities and nearby small- and large-scale mining activities, as well as through the use of pesticides to combat undesirable organisms, including in agriculture, and that approximately 73 million children are engaged in hazardous labour related to these activities, with the number of youngest children in hazardous labour increasing, thereby seriously affecting children’s health, well-being and development, Acknowledging ongoing discussions in the International Law Commission on the toxic remnants of war, and concerned at the possible threat that they pose to the full enjoyment of the rights of the child, Recalling that, while States shall respect, protect and fulfil human rights and have the duty to take the necessary measures to prevent the exposure of children to pollution, hazardous substances and wastes, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect the rights of the child, including by conducting human rights due diligence appropriate to their size and circumstances, the risk of severe impact and context of their operation, with a view to preventing or mitigating adverse impacts on the rights of the child through actions directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts, and to remediating contamination, Expressing concern that children impacted by the effects of environmental harm are often unable to fully exercise their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful assembly, or to have access to an effective remedy, and underscoring that States have a duty to ensure effective remedies for violations of the rights of the child, that children have access to information in child-friendly formats, and that every child capable of forming his or her views has the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child, including in environmental decision-making processes that may be relevant to his or her life, Recognizing the importance of public access to environmental information and education to enable children to understand environmental risks and the effects of environmental harm on the enjoyment of their rights, and the crucial nature of accessible and age-, gender- and disability-responsive information in this respect, Recognizing also the positive, important and legitimate role played by children and by child- and youth-led movements that defend human rights relating to a healthy environment, and deeply concerned that they may be among those most exposed and at risk, and recognizing the need to protect them, A/HRC/45/L.48/Rey.1 Underscoring the importance of protecting children from the adverse impact of environmental harm through decisive climate action, including through mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, pollution mitigation, the sound management of hazardous

Inclusion Strategy and the leadership of the Secretary-General to bring about transformative and systematic change on disability inclusion across the United Nations system, Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, including women, children, youth, persons with albinism, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple, aggravated and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of

resources and inaccessible public transport and facilities, 3/10 Recognizing that persons with disabilities are directly and _ indirectly disproportionally impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has exacerbated existing inequalities, discrimination, stigmatization, violence and exclusion and increased the risk of unemployment and poverty, as well as of violence and abuse, in particular against women and girls with disabilities, recognizing also that persons with disabilities may continue to experience the same conditions and challenges, including in the response, recovery and rebuilding phase, as well as face barriers and discrimination in accessing protection measures, appropriately designed personal protective equipment, medicines, vaccines,

meaningful participation, protecting their human rights, eliminating discrimination against them, and systematically collecting and using data disaggregated by sex, age and disability, Recognizing that eliminating discrimination, ensuring equal access to social protection floors and safety nets and enhancing responsive support and services to persons with disabilities are critical to promoting

challenge, and recognizing that further efforts are needed to strengthen the normative and operational links to effectively integrate the rights, participation, perspectives and needs of persons with disabilities into development policies and programmes, and, in particular, into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Noting the need for Member States, the United Nations system and other stakeholders to further strengthen the normative framework on disability, including the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the pledge of “leaving no one behind” of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and to consider disability as a global issue, cutting across the pillars of the United Nations, Stressing its resolve to build inclusive societies and, in this

maintain maximum independence, Recognizing the importance of promoting accessibility, mobility and road safety for persons with disabilities in the context of cities and other human settlements, and that accessibility is a means of achieving inclusive societies and development, Recognizing also the growing contribution of sport to the realization of development and peace, and stressing that major

have an opportunity to organize, develop and participate in disability-specific sporting and recreational activities, on an equal basis with others, and where the spirit of fair play prevails, violence is banned and ethical principles are upheld, Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable statistics, data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities, recognizing that high-quality, timely, accessible, reliable and disaggregated data are critical to measuring progress and ensuring that no one is left behind, and further noting the need for enhancing capacity-building support to developing countries, including the least developed countries and small island developing States, to increase significantly the availability of such data, Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,!* and their updates, encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by sex, age and disability, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data, such as but not limited to the United Nations Children’s Fund Module on Child Functioning and the tools and materials produced by the Washington Group on Disability Statistics, to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, Concerned that the lack of high-quality data required to provide viable baselines and measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals for persons with disabilities poses a significant challenge to effectively monitor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development for persons with disabilities, and in this regard welcoming the call for the disaggregation of data by disability in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes the need to significantly increase the availability of high- 3 Such as the Guidelines and

Resolution 70/1. 2/11 pandemic are projected to result in 13 million additional cases of child, early and forced marriage that otherwise would have been averted by 2030, Recognizing that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering of information on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Noting with concern that deep-rooted gender inequalities and stereotypes, harmful practices, perceptions and customs, and discriminatory norms are not only obstacles to the full enjoyment of human rights and the empowerment of all women and girls, but are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places children, in particular the girl child, at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, Noting with concern also that poverty, insecurity, early pregnancy and lack of education are also among the root causes of child, early and forced marriage, that armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies are among the exacerbating factors and that child, early and forced marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest communities, and recognizing that the immediate alleviation and eventual eradication of extreme poverty must remain a high priority for the international community, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and lack of accountability, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women to enter, advance and remain in the labour market, and that this harmful practice can impede economic independence and impose direct and indirect short- and long-term costs on society, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women can expand their options for leaving abusive relationships, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives and that the empowerment of and investment in all women and girls, as well as the strengthening of their voice, agency, leadership and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty and are critical, inter alia, for sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Bearing in mind the vital importance of birth registration for the realization of the human rights of individuals, especially girls, Recognizing that men and boys should play a role as strategic partners and allies of women and girls and that their meaningful engagement can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, as well as child, early and forced marriage, ending this practice and achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing also that families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders play an essential role in transforming negative social norms and 3/11 confronting gender inequality, and recognizing further that empowering girls, including already married girls, requires their active participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations, with the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Recognizing further the need to support girls and women who were subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and underscoring the importance of removing structural barriers that prevent their access to services that respond to their specific needs, Noting with concern that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities and the development of employable skills for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to pregnancy, marriage, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, and that educational possibilities and opportunities are directly related to the empowerment of women and girls, their employment and economic opportunities and their active participation in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Noting with concern also that, despite gains in providing access to education, girls are still more likely than boys to remain excluded from primary and secondary education, and recognizing that the attendance of girls at school can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain safe personal hygiene, such as water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools that meet the needs of girls, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage remains a serious threat to multiple aspects of the physical and psychological health of women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent and unintended pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, Recognizing also that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage can increase during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict, public health emergencies and natural disasters because of various factors, including insecurity, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, gender inequality, lack of access to continuous, quality education, the stigmatization of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruption in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, and that this requires increased attention, appropriate protection measures and coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, with the full and meaningful participation of the women and girls affected, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, and recognizing further the importance of addressing the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation in those situations, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-sensitive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Expressing deep concern about the unprecedented and multifaceted negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of, and efforts to end, child, 4/11 early and forced marriage, including the wide-reaching economic, social and human consequences and devastating impacts of the pandemic on the livelihoods of people and families, especially women and girls, and the poorest and most vulnerable, as well as the severe disruption to health and education systems, social protection programmes and the provision of protection and support services, including essential Services, Noting with deep concern that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures, including school closures and restrictions on the right to freedom of movement, are likely to increase risks faced by girls, including already married girls, as well as women affected by this harmful practice, including risks associated with sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking in persons and other types of exploitation, social isolation, unintended and/or early pregnancy, obstetric fistula, female genital mutilation, economic hardship, as well as the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and the associated risk of not returning to school, and difficulties in gaining access to health-care services, hindering the fulfilment of their rights and future economic opportunities, and that these risks are even further exacerbated in humanitarian situations, Expressing deep concern that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic not only exacerbates root causes of child, early and forced marriage, but also diverts international, regional and national attention and resources away from, inter alia, the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and other harmful practices, and furthermore that COVID-19 containment measures are delaying and disrupting efforts, including by civil society and other relevant stakeholders, to end child, early and forced marriage, especially at the local level, 1.

Urges Governments, while addressing child, early and forced marriage, to confront family poverty and social exclusion through investing in family-oriented policies addressing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on education, health, employment, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion, paying special attention to gender-sensitive social protection measures, child allowances for parents and pension benefits for older persons and protecting, supporting and empowering children, including girls, in child-headed households; 12. Also urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, to tackle poverty, lack of economic opportunities for women and girls and other entrenched economic incentives that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage, including by ensuring the rights of women and girls to inheritance and property, their equal access with men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, to encourage girls to continue their education, including through their re-enrolment in school after childbirth, to develop livelihood opportunities through access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills education, including financial literacy, and to promote freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as equal political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; 6/11 13. Encourages States to promote and protect the human rights of already married girls and women affected by this harmful practice, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution and to address their specific needs, such as through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, increase their decision-making power, make it easier for them to seek formal employment, increase their economic independence and financial literacy, access education, skills development programmes and lifelong learning opportunities, ensure their equal access to health-care services and information and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 14. Calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school, including because of marriage, pregnancy, childbirth and/or childcare responsibilities, which empowers young women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate and age-appropriate comprehensive education that is relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, and with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, with the best interests of the child as their basic concern, information on sexual and reproductive health and HIV prevention, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and foster informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 15. Recognizes that education is one of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to help married women and girls to make informed decisions about their lives, and urges States to remove barriers to education, including by investing in quality primary and secondary education for every child in a safe environment, through adequate financing, ensuring that married girls and boys, pregnant girls and women and young parents continue to have access to schooling, improving access to quality formal education and skills development, especially for those living in remote or insecure areas, improving the safety of girls at and on the way to and from school, providing safe and adequate sanitation, including for menstrual hygiene management, adopting and implementing laws and policies to prohibit, prevent and address violence and to hold perpetrators accountable, strengthening and intensifying their efforts to implement effective violence prevention and response activities in schools and communities, engaging men and boys, community leaders and parents, educating children from a young age regarding their human rights and the importance of treating all people with dignity and respect and designing educational programmes and teaching materials that support respectful relationships, non-violent behaviours, gender equality and empowerment of women and girls; 16.

Affirms the need for States and relevant United Nations entities and agencies to improve the collection and use of quantitative, qualitative and comparable data on violence against women and harmful practices, including in humanitarian settings and in the context of public health emergencies such as COVID-19, disaggregated by sex, age, disability, civil status, race, ethnicity, migratory status, geographical location, socioeconomic status, education level and other key factors, as appropriate, to enhance research and dissemination of evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and to strengthen monitoring and impact assessment of existing policies and programmes as a means of ensuring their effectiveness and implementation; 27. Encourages the international community to fulfil its commitment in supporting developing countries, particularly African countries, least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries, in strengthening the capacity of national statistical offices and data systems to ensure access to high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data while ensuring national ownership in supporting and tracking progress, including in the context of child, early and forced marriage; 28.

respect for human rights, tolerance, concern for others and the responsibility to foster safety, as well as whole-school and whole-community programmes that fully respect all human rights and help to prevent and address bullying, constitute best practices that should be developed, strengthened and shared through international cooperation, Acknowledging that children are uniquely placed to inform effective solutions and responses to bullying, including cyberbullying, and underlining that children’s participation and their contributions, including their views and recommendations, therefore need to be at the centre of efforts to prevent and address bullying and that their effective and meaningful participation is critical to a clear understanding of bullying and its impacts in order to
