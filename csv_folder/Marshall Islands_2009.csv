A/C.2/64/L.8/Rev.1 7. Identify forums or structures that may further be needed to integrate the government and non-government perspectives and knowledge necessary to realize national cybersecurity and critical information infrastructure protection goals. Public-private cooperation 8. Collect all actions taken and plans to develop collaboration between government and the private sector, including any arrangements for information- sharing and incident management. 9. Collect all current and planned initiatives to promote shared interests and address common challenges among both critical infrastructure participants and private-sector actors mutually dependent on the same interconnected critical infrastructure. Incident management and recovery 10. Identify the Government agency that serves as the coordinator for incident management, including capability for watch, warning, response and recovery functions; the cooperating Government agencies; non-government cooperating participants, including industry and other partners; and any arrangements in place for cooperation and trusted information- sharing. 11. Separately, identify national-level computer incident response capacity, including any computer incident response team with national responsibilities and its roles and responsibilities, including existing tools and procedures for the protection of Government computer networks, and existing tools and procedures for the dissemination of incident-management information. 12. Identify networks and processes of international cooperation that may enhance incident response and contingency planning, identifying partners and arrangements for bilateral and multilateral cooperation, where appropriate. Legal frameworks 13. Review and update legal authorities (including those related to cybercrime, privacy, data protection, commercial law, digital signatures and encryption) that may be outdated or obsolete as a result of the rapid uptake of and dependence upon new information and communication technologies, and use regional and international conventions, arrangements and precedents in these reviews. Ascertain whether your country has developed necessary legislation for the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime, noting existing frameworks, for example, United Nations General Assembly resolutions 55/63 and 56/121 on combating the criminal misuse of information technologies, and regional initiatives, including the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. 14. Determine the current status of national cybercrime authorities and procedures, including legal authorities and national cybercrime units, and the level of understanding among prosecutors, judges and legislators of cybercrime issues. 15. Assess the adequacy of current legal codes and authorities in addressing the current and future challenges of cybercrime, and of cyberspace more generally. 16. Examine national participation in international efforts to combat cybercrime, such as the 24/7 Cybercrime Point of Contact Network. A/C.2/64/L.8/Rev.1 17. Determine the requirements for national law enforcement agencies to cooperate with international counterparts to investigate transnational cybercrime in those instances in which infrastructure is situated or perpetrators reside in national territory, but victims reside elsewhere. Developing a global culture of cybersecurity 18. Summarize actions taken and plans to develop a national culture of cybersecurity referred to in United Nations General Assembly resolutions 57/239 and 58/199, including implementation of a cybersecurity plan for Government- operated systems, national awareness-raising programmes, outreach programmes to, among others, children and individual users, and national cybersecurity and critical information infrastructure protection training requirements. 09-61643",11/20/2009,2009_672141,Marshall Islands,N/A,yes

Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Seychelles, Singapore, Somalia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America",N/A,N/A,"The Security Council, Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 1846 (2008), and 1851 (2008), Continuing to be gravely concerned by the ongoing threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to the prompt, safe, and effective delivery of humanitarian aid to Somalia and the region, to international navigation and the safety of commercial maritime routes, and to other vulnerable ships, including fishing activities in conformity with international law and the extended range of the piracy threat into the western Indian Ocean, Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, including Somalia’s rights with respect to offshore natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with international law, Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (“The Convention”), sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities, Again taking into account the crisis situation in Somalia, and the limited capacity of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to interdict, or upon interdiction to prosecute pirates or to patrol or secure the waters off the coast of Somalia, including the international sea lanes and Somalia’s territorial waters, Noting the several requests from the TFG for international assistance to counter piracy off its coast, including the letters of 2 and 6 November 2009 from the Permanent Representative of Somalia to the United Nations expressing the appreciation of the TFG to the Security Council for its assistance, expressing the TFG’s willingness to consider working with other States and regional organizations to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off

Maritime Forces’ Combined Task Force 151, and other States acting in a national capacity in cooperation with the TFG and each other, to suppress piracy and to protect vulnerable ships transiting through the waters off the coast of Somalia, Noting with concern that the continuing limited capacity and domestic legislation to facilitate the custody and prosecution of suspected pirates after their capture has hindered more robust international action against the pirates off the coast of Somalia, and in some cases has led to pirates being released without facing justice, regardless of whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of the Convention concerning the repression of piracy, the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (“SUA Convention”) provides for parties to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, and accept delivery of persons responsible for or suspected of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or threat thereof or any other form of intimidation, and stressing the need for States to criminalize piracy under their domestic law and to favourably consider the prosecution, in appropriate cases, of suspected pirates, consistent with applicable international law, Commending the Republic of Kenya’s efforts to prosecute suspected pirates in its national courts, and noting with appreciation the assistance being provided by the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other international organizations and donors, in coordination with the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (“CGPCS”), to support Kenya, Somalia and other States in the region, including Seychelles and Yemen,

of the region, interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected pirates, S/2009/607 Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, the strengthening of State institutions, economic and social development and respect for human rights and the rule of law are necessary to create the conditions for a durable eradication of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and further emphasizing that Somalia’s long-term security rests with the effective development by the TFG of the National Security Force and Somali Police Force, in the framework of the Djibouti Agreement and in line with a national security strategy, Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia exacerbate the situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a
