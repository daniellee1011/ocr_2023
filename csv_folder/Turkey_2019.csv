Ababa Action Agenda of the third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda, and noting the integrated and indivisible nature of the 2030 Agenda and the range of goals, targets and indicators relevant to preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, including target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals, GE.19-11624(E) 911624* Please recycle eS A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 Welcoming the report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on child, early and forced marriage in humanitarian settings,’ and the report of the Secretary-General on child, early and forced marriage,” Welcoming also the United Nations Population Fund-United Nations Children’s Fund Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage, and other ongoing United Nations activities and programmes on child, early and forced marriage, noting regional, national and subnational instruments, mechanisms and initiatives to end child, early and forced marriage, including the African Union Campaign to End Child Marriage, the Model Law on Eradicating Child Marriage and Protecting Children Already in Marriage developed by the Southern African Development Community, the Regional Action Plan to End Child Marriage in South Asia (2015-2018), the Kathmandu Call for Action to End Child Marriage in South Asia, the Kigali Declaration adopted by national human rights institutions from Commonwealth countries, the Joint Inter-Agency Programme to End Child Marriage and Early Unions in Latin America and the Caribbean, and further encouraging coordinated approaches to action at all levels, Welcoming further the recent progress made globally towards ending child, early and forced marriage, including a decrease in the proportion of girls who were married before the age of 18 in the past decade from one in four to approximately one in five, while expressing concern that, despite this global trend, progress has been uneven across regions and that the current pace of change is not sufficient to fulfil the commitment under target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, Expressing concern that in some countries and contexts, rates of child, early and forced marriage are rising, and that every year at least 12 million girls are still married before they reach the age of 18, Recognizing that, while child, early and forced marriage primarily has an impact on women and girls, boys and men can also be subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and expressing concern that an estimated 1 in 30 boys marry before they reach the age of 18, Recognizing also that, in some contexts, the practice of child, early and forced marriage may include informal unions, cohabitation or other arrangements that are not formalized, registered or recognized by a religious, customary or State authority, that such arrangements should be addressed in policies and programmes on child, early and forced marriage and that the gathering of information and disaggregated data on these arrangements will help to develop responses for affected girls and women, Recognizing further that addressing child, early and forced marriage requires a holistic human rights-based approach, with interventions focused on preventing and ending harmful practices, and on changing social norms and attitudes that underlie the practices, and with special attention paid to and the meaningful involvement of those who have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage, Noting with concern that the incidence and risk of child, early and forced marriage is highly exacerbated in humanitarian settings by various factors, including insecurity, gender inequality, increased risks of sexual and gender-based violence, breakdown of the rule of law and State authority, the misconception of providing protection through marriage, the use of forced marriage as a tactic in conflict, lack of access to education, the stigma of pregnancy outside marriage, the absence of family planning services, disruptions in social networks and routines, increased poverty and the absence of livelihood opportunities, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates, abuses and impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other forms of violence and discrimination against women and girls and harmful practices, including female genital mutilation, and that such violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls, and underscoring the human rights obligations and commitments of States to respect, 1 A/ARC/41/19. 2 A/73/257. A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, Deeply concerned by the impact of deep-rooted and intersecting gender inequalities, patriarchal values, discriminatory gender norms, stereotypes, perceptions and customs that are among the primary causes of child, early and forced marriage as well as other forms of sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls, and deeply concerned also that poverty, insecurity, lack of access to education and health services, and adolescent pregnancy are also among the drivers of this harmful practice, and that it remains common in rural areas, in humanitarian settings and among the poorest communities, Recognizing that all members of society, including families, communities and religious, traditional and community leaders, play an essential role in changing negative social norms and confronting gender inequality, and recognizing also that empowering women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, requires their active, full, effective and meaningful participation in decision-making processes and as agents of change in their own lives and communities, including through women’s and girls’ organizations and feminist groups, Recognizing also the need to support girls and women who are subjected to child, early and forced marriage, as well as their children, and recognizing further the importance of ensuring the autonomy of these women and girls and their access to social services, counselling, shelter, education, lifelong learning and vocational training, to formal employment and economic independence for women and economic empowerment for girls , to adequate health services, information and education, including for sexual and reproductive health, mental health, psychosocial support and rehabilitation services, to nutrition, housing, clean water, sanitation and hygiene, and to justice, legal services and services that protect them from sexual and gender-based violence, and recognizing that such provisions are all necessary for the empowerment of women and girls, Recognizing further that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a serious threat to the full realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health by women and girls, including but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health, significantly increasing the risk of early, frequent, unintended and unwanted pregnancy, maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity, obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, as well as increasing vulnerability to all forms of violence, including domestic and intimate partner violence, Deeply concerned that child, early and forced marriage disproportionally affects girls who have received little or no formal education, and is itself a significant obstacle to educational opportunities for girls and young women, in particular girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare responsibilities, stigma related to menstruation, and social norms confining married women and girls to the home, and recognizing that ensuring educational opportunities is one of the most effective ways to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, women’s formal employment and economic opportunities, and the active participation of women and girls in economic, social and cultural development, governance and decision-making, Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage undermines women’s and girls’ autonomy and decision-making in all aspects of their lives, and remains an impediment not only to the economic, legal, health and social status of women and girls but also to the development of society as a whole, and that investing in the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, as well as strengthening their voice, agency, leadership and full, effective and meaningful participation in all decisions that affect them, are key factors in breaking the cycle of gender inequality and discrimination, violence and poverty, and are critical for, inter alia, sustainable development, peace, security, democracy and inclusive economic growth, Recognizing also that child, early and forced marriage is a major impediment to the achievement of the economic empowerment of women and girls and their social and economic development, thereby hampering the ability of women, to enter and advance and remain in the labour market, and recognizing further that the economic autonomy of women A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 and the investment in women’s and girls’ development is a priority in and of itself, has a multiplier effect and can expand their options for leaving forced or abusive relationships, Recognizing further that women and girls generally share the experience of being worse off economically than men and boys, and that often women and girls experience significantly higher declines in income and increased dependence on social welfare and other informal assistance, after dissolution of marriage, Expressing concern that child, early and forced marriage is underrecognized and underreported and often coincides with impunity and a lack of accountability and access to justice, particularly at the community level, and that the persistence of child, early and forced marriage, like other harmful practices, places women and girls at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and violence throughout their lives, including domestic and intimate partner violence, marital rape and sexual, physical and psychological violence, and reinforces the lower status of girls and adolescent girls in society, Noting that women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage may face discriminatory legal, practical and structural barriers to their access to justice and legal services, including stigmatization, risk of revictimization, harassment and _ possible retribution, Recognizing that the criminalization of child, early and forced marriage alone is insufficient when introduced without complementary measures and support programmes, and may instead contribute to the marginalization of and the loss of livelihoods for the families affected, and have the unintended effect of increasing the practice of informal unions or unregistered marriages, Recognizing also that everyone, including men and boys, benefits from the achievement of gender equality and that the impacts of gender inequality, discrimination and violence against women and girls, including child, early and forced marriage, are borne by society as a whole, and emphasizing, therefore, that men and boys, by taking responsibility themselves and working jointly in partnership with women and girls at all levels, can contribute to transforming discriminatory social norms that perpetuate gender-based violence, including child, early and forced marriage, and ending this practice, Recognizing further that preventing and ending child, early and forced marriage and supporting married girls and women affected by this harmful practice require appropriate gender- and age-responsive protection, prevention and response measures, as well as coordinated action by relevant stakeholders, and that existing gaps in the collection and use of reliable, disaggregated data and evidence remain a major challenge for programming and informing appropriate measures and actions, Recognizing that the registration of births, marriages, divorces and deaths is part of a comprehensive civil registration system that facilitates the development of vital statistics and the effective planning and implementation of programmes and policies intended to promote better governance and to achieve sustainable development, and that the absence of compulsory registration of customary and religious marriages is a major impediment to the implementation of existing legislation and other initiatives to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage, 1. Recognizes that child, early and forced marriage constitutes a violation, abuse or impairment of human rights and a harmful practice that prevents individuals from living their lives free from all forms of discrimination and violence, and that it has wide-ranging and adverse consequences for the enjoyment of human rights, the right to education and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, and that every girl and woman at risk of or affected by these practices must have equal access to quality education, counselling, shelter and other social services, psychological, sexual and reproductive health-care services and medical care; 2. Urges States to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of women and girls, including those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, to promote equality in all aspects of marriage and its dissolution and to address their specific needs, such as through targeted programmes that provide social services to protect them from sexual and gender- A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 based violence, including domestic and intimate-partner violence, increase their decision- making power and financial literacy, make it easier for women to seek formal employment and increase their economic independence, improve women’s and girls’ access to education, skills development programmes, vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities, ensure their equal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and decrease their social isolation, including by establishing or strengthening childcare services and working with communities to change discriminatory social norms; 3. Also urges States to enact, enforce, harmonize and uphold laws and policies aimed at preventing, responding to and eliminating child, early and forced marriage, protecting those at risk, including in humanitarian settings, and supporting women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the informed, free and full consent of the intending spouses and that women have equality with men in all matters pertaining to marriage, divorce, child custody and the economic consequences of marriage and its dissolution; 4. Further urges States to remove any provisions that may enable, justify or lead to child, early or forced marriage, including provisions that enable perpetrators of rape, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, abduction, trafficking in persons or modern slavery to escape prosecution and punishment by marrying their victims, in particular by repealing or amending such laws; 5. Calls upon States to ensure the timely registration of births and marriages, including by identifying and removing all physical, administrative, procedural and any other barriers that impede access to registration, especially for individuals living in rural and remote areas, and by providing, where lacking, mechanisms for the registration of customary and religious marriages; 6. Also calls upon States to develop and implement measures at all levels to end child, early and forced marriage, including national and subnational action plans where appropriate, and to make adequate resources available across relevant sectors, including health, nutrition, protection, governance and education; 7. Further calls upon States to promote and protect the right of women and girls to equal access to education through enhanced emphasis on free and quality primary and secondary education, including catch-up and literacy education for those who have not received formal education, have left school early or were forced to leave school because of, inter alia, marriage, pregnancy and/or childbirth, on re-entry policies and on vocational training and skills development, which empower young women and girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage to make informed decisions about their lives, employment, economic opportunities and health, including through scientifically accurate, age-appropriate comprehensive education, relevant to cultural contexts, that provides adolescent girls and boys and young women and men, in and out of school, consistent with their evolving capacities, with information on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and the empowerment of women, human rights, physical, psychological and pubertal development and power in relationships between women and men, to enable them to build self-esteem and informed decision-making, communication and risk reduction skills and to develop respectful relationships, in full partnership with young persons, parents, legal guardians, caregivers, educators and health-care providers, in order to contribute to ending child, early and forced marriage; 8. Calls upon States to ensure that married and/or pregnant adolescents and young mothers, as well as single mothers, can continue and complete their education, and in this regard, design, implement and, where applicable, revise educational policies to allow them to remain in and return to school, providing them with access to health-care and social services and support, including childcare and breastfeeding facilities and créches, and to education programmes with accessible locations, flexible schedules and distance education, including e-learning, and bearing in mind the important role and responsibilities of fathers, including young fathers, in this regard; 9. Urges Governments to respect, protect and fulfil the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 and reproductive health, through the development and enforcement of policies and legal frameworks and the strengthening of health systems, including health information systems, that make universally accessible, acceptable and available quality, gender-responsive, adolescent-friendly health services, sexual and reproductive health-care services, information, education and commodities, HIV and AIDS prevention, testing, treatment and care, mental health services and psychosocial support, and nutrition interventions and prevention, treatment of and care for obstetric fistula and other obstetric complications by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care; 10.

Urges Governments, with the collaboration of relevant stakeholders, to tackle poverty, lack of economic opportunities for women and girls, and other entrenched economic incentives and inequalities that act as drivers of child, early and forced marriage and as obstacles to leaving a forced or abusive relationship, including by ensuring the rights of women and girls to inheritance and property, their equal access with men and boys to social protection, childcare services and direct financial services, to encourage women and girls to continue their education, including through their re-enrolment in school after childbirth, marriage or dissolution of marriage, to develop livelihood opportunities through access to technical and vocational education and training and life skills education, including financial literacy, and to promote freedom of movement, women’s equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as full and equal political participation and rights to inherit, own and control land and productive measures; 12. Calls upon States to strengthen laws and regulatory frameworks that promote the reconciliation and sharing of work and family responsibilities for women and men, including by designing, implementing and promoting family-responsive legislation, policies and services, such as parental and other leave schemes, increased flexibility in working arrangements, support for breastfeeding mothers, development of infrastructure and technology, and the provision of services, including affordable, accessible and quality childcare and care facilities for children and other dependents, and promoting men’s equitable responsibilities with respect to household work as fathers and caregivers, which create an enabling environment for women’s economic empowerment; 13. Also calls upon States to develop and implement, in consultation with and with the participation of women and girls, and integrate into humanitarian responses, from the early stages of humanitarian emergencies, measures to address the increased vulnerability of women and girls to child, early and forced marriage, and to protect women and girls, in particular those subjected to child, early and forced marriage, from sexual and gender-based violence and exploitation during humanitarian emergencies, situations of forced displacement, armed conflict and natural disaster, including by ensuring their access to such services as health and education, as well as strengthening follow-up and interventions to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage in humanitarian settings, as well as to address the needs of those affected; 14. Further calls upon States to ensure that all initiatives to , amend and implement criminal laws addressing child, early and forced marriage are part of a comprehensive approach and coupled with protection measures and services for victims and survivors and those who are at risk of being subjected to harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage; 15. | Urges Governments to take measures to support girls and women who have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage, and calls upon States and all relevant A/HRC/41/L.8/Rev.1 actors to strengthen, inter alia, the development, enactment, implementation and monitoring of relevant legislation and protection mechanisms, such as safe shelters, counselling and other support services, as well as programmes focusing on, inter alia, education, health, livelihood, autonomy and decision-making that support the empowerment of girls and women that have been subjected to child, early and forced marriage; 16. Urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing and eliminating child, early and forced marriage and protecting the rights of women and girls subjected to this harmful practice, including by informing women, girls and boys about their rights under relevant laws, including in marriage and at its dissolution, improving legal infrastructure, removing all barriers to access to legal aid, including legal advice, assistance and representation, as well as to access to judicial and other legal remedies, addressing legal inconsistencies, training law enforcement officers, the judiciary and professionals working with women and children and ensuring oversight of the handling of cases of child, early and forced marriage; 17.

Encourages relevant United Nations entities, regional and subregional organizations, civil society and other relevant actors and human rights mechanisms to continue to collaborate with and support States, upon their request, in developing and implementing strategies and policies, and in strengthening and building capacity for data, indicators and reporting systems for analysing, monitoring and publicly reporting on progress, at the national, regional and international levels based on evidence, and to assist States in effectively developing measures to prevent, respond to and eliminate child, early and forced marriage; 21. Affirms the need for States to improve the collection and use of quantitative, qualitative and comparable disaggregated data on child, early and forced marriage, to enhance research on and dissemination of evidence-based and good practices relating to the prevention and elimination of child, early and forced marriage and to strengthen monitoring and impact assessment of existing policies and programmes as a means of ensuring their effectiveness and implementation; 22.

peace and security, the Commission on the Status of Women and other United Nations agencies and bodies that consider the issue of discrimination against women and girls, Underscoring the fact that international human rights law prohibits discrimination, inter alia on the basis of gender, and that national legislation, policies and practices should adhere to each State’s international obligations, Expressing profound concern at the backlash against progress made by States, international and regional organizations and civil society, including women’s and community-based organizations, feminist groups, women human rights defenders, trade unions and girls’ and youth-led organizations, to respect, protect and fulfil all human rights, and recognizing that these retrogressions can be linked to economic crisis and inequality, retrogressive lobbies, political views or misuse of religion to oppose the struggle for women’s and girls’ equal rights, Recognizing that the right to liberty is a human right recognized in international instruments and that it is inextricably linked to other rights, including the rights to freedom of movement, the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, sexual and reproductive health, work, education, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, freedom of expression, freedom of religion or belief, equality, freedom from discrimination, and privacy, with full respect for the dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy of the person, Recognizing also the differing needs of girls and women at different ages and stages of their lives, and the various forms of discrimination, in particular multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, that affect their day-to-day reality and that can lead to deprivation of liberty not only in detention facilities but also in other public and private institutions, private homes and community spaces, and in situations of conflict and crisis, Recognizing further that discrimination against women and girls is inherently linked to deep-rooted patriarchal and gender stereotypes and unequal power relations, that discriminatory attitudes, behaviours, norms, perceptions, customs and harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage, have direct negative implications for the status and treatment of women and girls and that gender-biased environments promote impunity and impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination against women and girls, Reaffirming that the full enjoyment of all human rights by all women and girls includes their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free from coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexuality, sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy and agency of the person, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, in accordance with applicable international human rights standards, Recognizing the major contributions made by civil society, including women’s organizations, feminist groups, women human rights defenders, trade unions and girls’ and youth-led organizations, to promoting the empowerment of women and girls and the fulfilment of all their human rights, and recognizing also the importance of having an open, inclusive and transparent engagement with civil society in the implementation of measures promoting substantive gender equality in the empowerment of women and girls in all spheres, Regretting that women remain underrepresented, especially in management positions, in several United Nations bodies and mechanisms responsible for developing international human rights norms and standards and monitoring their implementation, and noting that balanced gender representation is an essential step towards bringing about a structural change needed to advance substantive gender equality and gender parity in line with the system-wide strategy on gender parity, while bearing in mind the necessity to A/HRC/41/L.6/Rev.1 secure the highest standard of efficiency, competence and integrity, as well as equitable geographical distribution, Taking note of the work of the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee regarding mainstreaming a gender perspective and the issue of gender equality, 1.

women human rights defenders, trade unions and girls’ and youth-led organizations, to respect, protect and fulfil all human rights, and recognizing that these retrogressions can be linked to economic

harm or suffering, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is a global phenomenon rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between women and men, which further reinforce gender stereotypes and barriers to women’s and girls’ full enjoyment of all human rights, and that all forms of violence against women and girls, including harmful practices, constitute a major impediment to their full, equal, effective and meaningful participation in society, the economy, and political and individual decision-making, as well as in leadership roles, hindering them from the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, Recognizing also that violence against women and girls is a manifestation of gender inequality and discrimination against women and

workplaces and contract statuses, such as those of temporary workers and domestic workers, including migrant domestic workers, as well as the informal sector and those working in conflict and post-conflict settings, and that gaps need to be addressed, Recognizing that women and girls undertake a disproportionate share of unpaid and domestic work and that policies and initiatives that support the reconciliation of work and family life and the equal sharing of responsibilities between women and men are critical for achieving gender equality and eliminating violence against women and girls, Recognizing also the role of employers in developing effective human resources and labour protection policies to prevent and respond to violence in the workplace, establishing

Permanent Mission of Turkey to the United Nations Please recycle OO : 19-14081 HA 230819 A A A A A/74/291 Annex I Explanatory memorandum Historical background and mission For nearly 100 years, the International Organization of Employers has been working to create a sustainable economic environment, in collaboration with its members, that promotes free enterprise and is fair and beneficial to both business and society. The Organization was founded in March 1920 in London. The International Organization of Employers is recognized for its unique expertise, advocacy and influence as a powerful and balanced voice for business. Its main areas of activity include the following: (a) generation of employment; (b) facilitation of skills development and lifelong learning opportunities; (c) empowerment of women and promotion of diversity; (d) development and enhancement of responsible business behaviour; (e) youth employment; and (f) digitalization and the future of work. The global network of the International Organization of Employers directly improves people’s lives by working to ensure that economic prosperity benefits all. It is the sole representative of businesses to the International Labour Organization (ILO). Furthermore, it is known across the United Nations system, the Group of 20 and in the context of other forums, as set out in sections 3 to 6 below. At its March 2019 session, the ILO Governing Body welcomed the objective of the International Trade Union Confederation and International Organization of Employers to be granted observer status in the General Assembly. The ILO Governing Body is composed of 56 titular members (28 Governments, 14 employers and 14 workers) and 66 deputy members (28 Governments, 19 employer and 19 workers). Membership and organizational structure The International Organization of Employers represents 50 million businesses through its business and employer organization members in 150 countries. Membership is based on the consideration of businesses as “employers” and the role that members enjoy in shaping national social policies. The Organization looks carefully at three criteria when any organization expresses its willingness to apply for membership: independence (not public or compulsory contributions), representativeness and values. As a result, its members are well-recognized and influential business players shaping local policy. The supreme decision-making body of the Organization is the General Council, which brings together delegates from the membership organizations. It meets at least once a year, and is responsible for approving the work of the Management Board, which formulates the general policy direction of the Organization, adopts a plan of action for the next year and assesses the previous year’s work. The secretariat, the body responsible for the day-to-day running of the Organization, is led by the Secretary-General, currently Roberto Suarez Santos, who is accountable to the General Council and the Management Board. Membership of the International Organization of Employers is global in character and encompasses a comprehensive representation of business. The Organization does not represent one nation or one region, one type or size of business or one sector of the economy. It speaks for all businesses regardless of size, industry, location or legal structure. It also supports business networks of multinational companies: almost 50 multinational companies participate in the specific and dynamic networks of human resources managers and global directors of industrial relations. 2/11 A/74/291 Relations with United Nations agencies: International Labour Organization The International Organization of Employers is the secretariat of the Employers’ Group in the ILO governance structures and tripartite bodies and therefore represents one of the three constituents of ILO, one of the oldest specialized United Nations agencies, with 187 member States. This is exceptional within the United Nations system. ILO is the only tripartite United Nations agency that brings together government, employer and worker representatives to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes aimed at promoting full and productive employment and decent work for all and promoting, inter alia, Sustainable Development Goal 8 (on promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all). For 100 years, ILO has promoted rights at work, encouraged productive employment and decent work opportunities, enhanced social protection and strengthened social dialogue on work-related issues. In its everyday operation, ILO gives an equal voice to workers, employers and governments to ensure that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in labour standards and in shaping policies and programmes. Employers’ organizations, which are represented by the International Organization of Employers at ILO, are a critical component of any social dialogue process, which can help to ensure that social and economic objectives are reflected in a balanced manner in ILO instruments, taking into account the needs of protection of workers and also the needs of sustainable enterprises. Because of the importance of tripartism, ILO has made the ratification and implementation of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144) a priority. Furthermore, the 2008 Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization has stressed the key role of this instrument (together with the other three Governance (Priority) Conventions, No. 81, No. 122 and No. 129) from the viewpoint of governance. Consequently, the international labour standards, without exception, are formulated, applied and supervised through a tripartite structure. The tripartite approach to adopting standards ensures that they have broad support from all ILO constituents. Up until the present time, ILO has adopted 190 conventions and 206 recommendations, most of which are up to date. All of the conventions and recommendations were established in a tripartite manner and were adopted by a majority vote of International Organization of Employers representatives, International Trade Union Confederation representatives and government representatives of the member States. In 1998, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work was adopted by the ILO constituents (employers and workers, under the leadership and with the support of the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation, respectively, and member States). The Declaration, which was initiated by the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation, commits member States to respect and promote principles and rights in the following four categories: (a) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; (b) the elimination of forced or compulsory labour; (c) the abolition of child labour; and (d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 3/11 A/74/291 One central component of the ILO supervisory system is the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards, which examines the report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations each year. It is a permanent tripartite body of the legislative body of ILO, the International Labour Conference. It offers the representatives of governments, employers and workers the opportunity to undertake a joint examination of the manner in which States comply with their obligations deriving from the conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference. Following the technical and independent examination of government reports on their compliance with ILO conventions and recommendations carried out by the Committee of Experts, it is the employers’ and workers’ delegates to the conference, under the leadership and with the support of the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation, who select 24 cases that will be examined before the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards. Furthermore, the employers’ vice-chairperson, who is traditionally a Vice-President of the International Organization of Employers, and the workers’ vice-chairperson, led and supported by the International Trade Union Confederation, are responsible for formulating the conclusions on the cases in the format of requests directed to governments. In the context of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards, the social partners play an indispensable role for the core of the ILO supervisory system. In sum, the International Organization of Employers is highly engaged in global governance, contributing directly and indirectly to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, full and productive employment, decent work and economic growth, fair migration policies, climate change mitigation, conflict prevention, peace and security, among other issues. Role within the repositioning of the United Nations development system Like the other members of the United Nations development system, ILO has an important role to fulfil within the repositioning of the United Nations development system, as laid out in General Assembly resolution 72/279. The reform of the United Nations development system calls for a stronger role for social partners in the United Nations system. This includes the International Organization of Employers, which, as a constituent of ILO, is well placed to make a significant contribution to this goal and to improve the accountability, efficiency and coherence of the United Nations development system. The overarching aim of the reform of the United Nations development system includes the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, as also reflected in the new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. To successfully implement the Goals, the United Nations must work with the representative employers’ and workers’ federations, which are critical agents in influencing local policy. These organizations play a key role in the negotiation and implementation of and follow-up to the 2030 Agenda at the United Nations and at the country level. In order to adapt to these requirements, ILO in 2018 took measures to implement this overarching goal and to adapt its development cooperation to the achievement of the Goals. The International Organization of Employers provided significant support for this decision and serves as a main actor in the implementation progress on the ground. Also, workers’ and employers’ organizations often join efforts through social dialogue and partnership, which are key for social stability and democracy. 4.1. Activities within the United Nations Sustainable Development Group ILO is a member of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group and is actively involved in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 72/279 and 4/11 A/74/291 the United Nations development reform process. Being part of the tripartite structure, the International Organization of Employers helps to shape the ILO position within the Group. 4.2. Activities within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework General Assembly resolution 72/279 elevated the position of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (formerly the United Nations Development Assistance Framework) to become the most important planning and implementation instrument for the United Nations development system response to national needs and priorities in countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and thereby provide a contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. According to the new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, the United Nations country teams are mandated to support Member States in four interlinked areas: (a) sustainable development; (b) human rights; (c) peace and democracy; and (d) natural disaster prevention and response capability (resilience). This mandate involves supporting Member States in respecting, promoting, implementing and reporting on their obligations and commitments under the international norms and standards that the United Nations system upholds, including human rights instruments and international labour standards. The normative work that ILO undertakes within its mandate to support ILO members in complying with and reporting on international labour conventions and recommendations is fundamental to anchoring the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework inside the norms and standards of the United Nations. For example, the workplan in the framework of a specific United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework on inclusive growth and decent work could include ILO support on implementing ratified international labour conventions based on comments and decisions of the supervisory mechanisms, including the conclusions of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference. Pursuing the normative agenda and the universal values that bind the United Nations must continue to be a priority of collective United Nations action at the country level, including through the engagement of the resident coordinators. Consequently, the social partners and ILO are closely interlinked in the process and will actively contribute to the good functioning of the new framework process. In his letter dated 7 November 2018, addressed to the Director General of ILO, the Secretary-General stated his conviction that the reform process would lead to greater inter-agency cross-fertilization in support of the development priorities of countries, in turn expanding opportunities for the specific skill sets of specialized agencies such as ILO. The close link between the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework and the ILO decent work country programme needs to be stressed. Such programmes follow two objectives: (a) promotion of decent work as a key component of national development strategies; and (b) the organization of ILO knowledge, instruments, advocacy and cooperation at the service of tripartite constituents. The programme is conducted within a results-based framework in order to advance the decent work agenda within the fields of comparative advantage of ILO. Tripartism and social dialogue, and hence the voices of workers and employers, are central to the planning and implementation of a coherent and integrated ILO programme. Decent work country programmes are the distinct ILO contribution to United Nations country programmes and constitute one of the main instruments to better integrate regular budget and extrabudgetary technical cooperation. 5/11 A/74/291 Relations with United Nations agencies and United Nations processes Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals Through its mandate, that universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice, ILO, as well as the International Organization of Employers in its role as one if its constituents, are crucial to promoting and advancing the entire 2030 Agenda and touch upon all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The decent work agenda is a driver of sustainable development and as such helps to advance many of the Goals. The International Organization of Employers has proven to be a reliable partner in activities essential to the achievement of the Goals, within and beyond ILO activities, especially in the achievement of substantial changes in local policies and regulations, through its members, who enjoy strong influence in this field. Furthermore, ILO development cooperation is now based on the promotion of the 2030 Agenda. 5.2. Economic and Social Council In the context of the work of the Economic and Social Council, the International Organization of Employers was one of the first organizations to have received consultative status in the Council, in 1947. Consequently, the Organization, in addition to its role as a member of ILO, is very familiar with the United Nations system and has had long-standing experience in the international diplomatic context. 5.3. Global Forum on Migration and Development and Global Compact for Migration The International Organization of Employers was invited by States attending the Global Forum on Migration and Development to coordinate the Global Forum business mechanism, a channel to provide the input of the private sector to the Forum. The interaction with employers enables governments to understand how migration policies and practices affect business operations at the national level. In view of demographic realities and skills shortages, employers face challenges in hiring the skills they need and can be a constructive partner in policymaking. The International Organization of Employers has signed an agreement with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), committing to finding practical and operational tools to be used by governments and business to combat unscrupulous recruitment practices. One such tool led by IOM is the International Recruitment Integrity System, a voluntary accreditation system for recruitment intermediaries so that they can demonstrate their commitment to fair and ethical practices. The International Organization of Employers is part of the Advisory Committee of the International Recruitment Integrity System. Within the framework of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, several representatives of the International Organization of Employers spoke at United Nations Headquarters in New York in July 2018. The thematic debate was focused on the enhancement of public-private dialogue to rethink labour migration policies and international skills mobility. With the participation of the International Organization of Employers and the World Employment Confederation, ILO has launched a fair recruitment initiative, which is aimed at preventing human trafficking, promoting safe migration and reducing the costs of labour mobility. The International Organization of Employers actively contributed its expertise to the negotiation process of the Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular 6/11 A/74/291 Migration, which was adopted by the General Assembly in 2018. The President of the International Organization of Employers spoke on behalf of the private sector at the adoption conference hosted by the President of the General Assembly in December 2018. The International Organization of Employers has also established a policy working group on international labour migration to ensure that the voice of businesses of all sizes and in all regions are taken into account in the elaboration of policy recommendations. 5.4. Human Rights Council (Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) The International Organization of Employers provides important employer perspectives in the many policy initiatives and forums held in the Human Rights Council. As a tripartite member of ILO and with previous experience in addressing human and labour rights challenges in the world of work globally, the Organization helps to link the work of ILO with that of the Human Rights Council. Throughout the process of developing and now implementing the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the International Organization of Employers provided a vital, constructive and broad-based business perspective to the many activities and initiatives that seek to advance the business and human rights and responsible business conduct agendas, involving and coordinating both multinational enterprises and small and medium-sized companies. The International Organization of Employers advocates on behalf of businesses, sharing the realities faced by business with policymakers and advocacy organizations to ensure reasonable, realistic and workable solutions. Through its training and capacity-building projects, the International Organization of Employers also helps businesses of all sizes to meet their responsibility to respect human rights, in line with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to make a positive contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Respecting and advancing human rights is a priority for the international business community and, as the world’s largest international private sector network, the Organization is a critical stakeholder in helping to increase uptake of the Guiding Principles. 5.5. United Nations Global Compact The International Organization of Employers has been a crucial partner throughout the elaboration of the United Nations Global Compact, since its creation. All Secretaries-General of the Organization have been members of the Global Compact Board, actively contributing to its debates and decisions. Most members of the International Organization of Employers also participate in the Global Compact local networks, and a high percentage of the Global Compact local networks are run by members of the Organization, owing to the strong influence that they enjoy in this field and their active commitment to the principles of the Global Compact. Activities with Governments and international governmental organizations Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development The International Organization of Employers has close links with the Business and Industry Advisory Committee at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Both organizations collaborate in providing recommendations to the Group of Seven. 7/11 A/74/291 6.2. Group of 20 and Group of Seven The International Organization of Employers represents the core outreach group to the Group of 20 and the Group of Seven in terms of business representation. Among other common activities, together with the International Trade Union Confederation, it has developed, implemented and delivered on bipartite and tripartite agreements in the context of the Group of 20 and the Group of Seven. In June 2019, for the first time, the Group of Seven agreed on a joint statement with international social partners, the International Organization of Employers/Business and Industry Advisory Committee to OECD and _ the International Trade Union Confederation/Trade Union Advisory Committee to OECD, with a focus on: (a) strengthening coherence of the actions of international organizations and respect for international labour standards; (b) extending access to social protection; (c) adapting labour market institutions and promoting skills development in the new world of work; and (d) closing the gender employment, participation and pay gaps. Reasons for seeking observer status for the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation The International Organization of Employers contributes to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals through its results-oriented membership, including a concrete impact on the ground. By granting the Organization observer status in the General Assembly, the United Nations system will strengthen its credibility as a multilateral body aimed at finding solutions through partnerships with employers’ representatives. Together with the International Trade Union Confederation, the International Organization of Employers can serve as a proactive bridge between the United Nations and the world of work, at a time when the United Nations is looking to expand partnerships. More concretely, the Organization can prospectively further, as it has already furthered, as laid down in the examples above, the attainment of the goals of the United Nations, especially in the context of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, through the following approaches: (a) helping the United Nations to understand how businesses function and the most effective outreach avenues; (b) contributing extensive knowledge and experience on different aspects of the world of work to United Nations initiatives and programmes; (c) assisting businesses to address fundamental labour human rights violations and challenges; and (d) bringing the global voices of business to global debates and dialogue on sustainable development, migration, climate change, gender empowerment, youth integration and conflict prevention. In the context of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, the International Organization of Employers shares the same goal, namely to provide a better and sustainable future for all human beings, which is also often the goal of employers. As such, their voices are well represented by the International Organization of Employers, which is an organization that internationally coordinates the voices of employers around the globe. Furthermore, the reform of the United Nations development system calls for the stronger representation of employers in the United Nations system. The International Organization of Employers will contribute significantly to the aim of improving the accountability, efficiency and coherence of the United Nations development system, including by providing a valuable challenge function. In this regard, the contribution of the International Organization of Employers to the decision-making process of ILO has to be mentioned once more. As 8/11 A/74/291 international social partners, the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation represent 50 per cent of the eligible voters within ILO, and their voices have been indispensable for the consent and contribution of ILO to the United Nations reform process. In his letter, mentioned above, the Secretary-General thanked all ILO tripartite constituents for their collaboration. Finally, the International Organization of Employers, owing to its long-standing membership and continuously excellent representation of employers at ILO, is best equipped to involve their voices in United Nations forums. The General Assembly is a crucial focal point where the Organization could contribute with its policymaking expertise in the context of the business world in all regions of the world. While the requests for observer status of both the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation are submitted separately, to conform with the formal requirements of United Nations proceedings, both requests are intrinsically linked and are submitted so as to be granted observer status simultaneously. Indeed, to continue to be effective, both organizations need to continue to be able to act jointly at the global level. Conclusion The International Organization of Employers and its member federations represent the consolidated voice of business throughout the process of shaping United Nations policy. The above elaborated connections between the international representative of employers and the United Nations has made it evident that, for the successful achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, considering the expertise of the Organization is crucial. As a representative of employers, it is, above all, critical in influencing local policy. It plays a key role in the negotiations, implementation of and follow-up to the 2030 Agenda at the United Nations and at the country level. Furthermore, employers’ organizations often join efforts with workers’ organizations through social dialogue and partnership, which are key for social stability and democracy. As the representative of employers within ILO, the International Organization of Employers, together with the International Trade Union Confederation, represent 50 per cent of the eligible voters and hence are crucial to the decision-making process at ILO, a specialized United Nations agency. Being part of the tripartite structure of ILO, the International Organization of Employers can, in addition to working to fulfil the ILO mandate, determine the position of ILO within the United Nations Sustainable Development Group. It is the intention of the Organization to use the momentum and to support the United Nations in the implementation process of the 2030 Agenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Simultaneously, the Organization will intensify its communications and strengthen its efficient and effective working relations with the United Nations. 9/11 A/74/291 Annex IT Letter dated 12 July 2019 from the Director General of the International Labour Organization On behalf of the International Labour Organization (ILO), I would like to express my support for the request by the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation for observer status in the General Assembly. The International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation have a long-standing role in representing the interests of workers’ and employers’ organizations in the tripartite governance structure of ILO and have contributed directly to the development of international labour standards and the promotion of decent work for all. Their membership includes more than 207 million workers and 50 million businesses, respectively, in more than 150 countries. Both institutions are influential players in the multilateral world, at the United Nations as well as in the Group of 20, the Group of Seven and other forums. They are strongly committed to advancing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation are founding partners and members of the Board of the United Nations Global Compact. They represent workers’ and employers’ organizations at the Human Rights Council and have played a fundamental role in the elaboration of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. They have also contributed to the negotiations with respect to the Global Compact on Migration and are core stakeholders in the Global Forum on Migration and Development. We are confident that, by granting observer status in the General Assembly to both the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation, Member States will be taking an important step to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation. It will allow for greater participation of business and workers in the development of global policies and standards while helping to rally millions of stakeholders behind the implementation of internationally agreed outcomes. In the context of the reform of the United Nations development system, it would be extremely valuable to count on the contributions of national trade unions and employers’ organizations affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Organization of Employers, respectively, working together with United Nations country teams, to support the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals through partnerships and social dialogue. Such observer status would also allow for a more coherent, consistent and legitimate participation of workers and employers in areas where enhancing private sector engagement is most urgent, including climate change, gender empowerment, youth promotion and sustainable peace. For all of these reasons, I hope that you will be in a position to lend support to the request for observer status for the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation in the General Assembly.

Permanent Mission of Turkey to the United Nations 19-14086 HA 230819 A A A A A/74/292 Annex I Explanatory memorandum 1. Historical background and mission The International Trade Union Confederation’s primary mission since 2006 has been the promotion and defence of workers’ rights and interests through international cooperation between trade unions, global campaigning and advocacy within the major global institutions. The Confederation was formed in 2006 following the merger of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Confederation of Labour. Its main areas of activity include the following: (a) promotion of workers’ rights and decent work; (b) promotion of equality and non-discrimination, dignity and justice for all; (c) promotion of sustainable development, peace and democracy; (d) support for economic and social policies that ensure economic well-being for all and the advancement of global governance; (e) work for the elimination of modern slavery; and (f) campaigning for the just distribution of economic wealth with universal social protection, minimum living wages and collective bargaining. The global network of the International Trade Union Confederation directly improves people’s lives by working to ensure that economic prosperity benefits all. It is the sole representative of workers to the International Labour Organization (ILO). Furthermore, it is known across the United Nations system, the Group of 20 and in the context of other forums, as set out in sections 3 to 6 below. The International Trade Union Confederation cooperates with the European Trade Union Confederation, including through the Pan-European Regional Council. At its March 2019 session, the ILO Governing Body welcomed the objective of the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Organization of Employers to be granted observer status in the General Assembly. The ILO Governing Body is composed of 56 titular members (28 Governments, 14 employers and 14 workers) and 66 deputy members (28 Governments, 19 employers and 19 workers). 2. Membership and organizational structure The International Trade Union Confederation, which is based in Brussels, is the world’s largest trade union federation. Today, it represents 207 million workers through its 331 affiliated organizations in 163 countries. It has three main regional organizations: the Asia-Pacific Regional Organization, the American Regional Organization and the African Regional Organization. The supreme authority of the organization is the World Congress of the International Trade Union Confederation, which ordinarily meets every four years, although the majority of the members of the General Council of the Confederation can call for the holding of extraordinary congresses. The members of the General Council as well as the General Secretary and the auditors are elected by the participants at the World Congress. The current General Secretary of the Confederation is Sharan Burrow. 3. Relations with United Nations agencies: International Labour Organization The International Trade Union Confederation is the secretariat of the Workers’ Group in the ILO governance structures and tripartite bodies and therefore represents 2/12 A/74/292 one of the three constituents of ILO, one of the oldest specialized United Nations agencies, with 187 member States. This is exceptional within the United Nations system. ILO is the only tripartite United Nations agency that brings together government, employer and worker representatives to set labour standards, develop policies and devise programmes aimed at promoting full and productive employment and decent work for all and promoting, inter alia, Sustainable Development Goal 8 (on promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all). For 100 years, ILO has promoted rights at work, encouraged productive employment and decent work opportunities, enhanced social protection and strengthened social dialogue on work-related issues. In its everyday operation, ILO gives an equal voice to workers, employers and governments to ensure that the views of the social partners are closely reflected in labour standards and in shaping policies and programmes. Trade unions, which are represented by the International Trade Union Confederation at ILO, are key civil society institutions in most democratic countries. In a rapidly globalizing world, the challenge of securing decent work, safe conditions of work, living wages, basic social security, gender equality and fair income distribution calls for better global governance and universal application and enforcement of international labour standards. Since its creation, ILO has been regarded by trade unions as an essential institution for promoting the protection of workers through global social dialogue and standard-setting, and trade unions seek to ensure that workers’ views are reflected in ILO instruments. Because of the importance of tripartism, ILO has made the ratification and implementation of the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention, 1976 (No. 144) a priority. Furthermore, the 2008 Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization has stressed the key role of this instrument (together with the other three Governance (Priority) Conventions, No. 81, No. 122 and No. 129) from the viewpoint of governance. Consequently, the international labour standards, without exception, are formulated, applied and supervised through a tripartite structure. The tripartite approach to adopting standards ensures that they have broad support from all ILO constituents. Up until the present time, ILO has adopted 190 conventions and 206 recommendations, most of which are up to date. All of the conventions and recommendations were established in a tripartite manner and were adopted by a majority vote of International Organization of Employers representatives, International Trade Union Confederation representatives and government representatives of the member States. In 1998, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work was adopted by the ILO constituents (employers and workers, under the leadership and with the support of the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation, respectively, and member States). The Declaration, which was initiated by the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation, commits member States to respect and promote principles and rights in the following four categories: (a) freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; (b) the elimination of forced or compulsory labour; (c) the abolition of child labour; and (d) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 3/12 A/74/292 One central component of the ILO supervisory system is the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards, which examines the report of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations each year. It is a permanent tripartite body of the legislative body of ILO, the International Labour Conference. It offers the representatives of governments, employers and workers the opportunity to undertake a joint examination of the manner in which States comply with their obligations deriving from the conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference. Following the technical and independent examination of government reports on their compliance with ILO conventions and recommendations carried out by the Committee of Experts, it is the employers’ and workers’ delegates to the conference, under the leadership and with the support of the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation, who select 24 cases that will be examined before the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards. Furthermore, the employers’ vice-chairperson, who is traditionally a Vice-President of the International Organization of Employers, and the workers’ vice-chairperson, led and supported by the International Trade Union Confederation, are responsible for formulating the conclusions on the cases in the format of requests directed to governments. In the context of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards, the social partners play an indispensable role for the core of the ILO supervisory system. In sum, the International Trade Union Confederation is highly engaged in global governance, contributing directly and indirectly to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, full and productive employment, decent work and economic growth, fair migration policies, climate change mitigation, conflict prevention, peace and security, among other issues. 4. Role within the repositioning of the United Nations development system Like the other members of the United Nations development system, ILO has an important role to fulfil within the repositioning of the United Nations development system, as laid out in General Assembly resolution 72/279. The reform of the United Nations development system calls for a stronger role for trade unions in the United Nations system. This includes the International Trade Union Confederation, which, as a constituent of ILO, is well placed to make a significant contribution to this goal and to improve the accountability, efficiency and coherence of the United Nations development system. The overarching aim of the reform of the United Nations development system includes the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, as also reflected in the new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. To successfully implement the Goals, the United Nations must work with the representative employers’ and workers’ federations, which are critical agents in influencing local policy. These organizations play a key role in the negotiation and implementation of and follow-up to the 2030 Agenda at the United Nations and at the country level. In order to adapt to these requirements, ILO in 2018 took measures to implement this overarching goal and to adapt its development cooperation to the achievement of the Goals. The International Trade Union Confederation provided significant support for this decision and serves as a main actor in the implementation progress on the ground. Also, workers’ and employers’ organizations often join efforts through social dialogue and partnership, which are key for social stability and democracy. 4/12 A/74/292 4.1. Activities within the United Nations Sustainable Development Group ILO is a member of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group and is actively involved in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 72/279 and the United Nations development reform process. Being part of the tripartite structure, the International Trade Union Confederation helps to shape the ILO position within the Group. 4.2. Activities within the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework General Assembly resolution 72/279 elevated the position of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (formerly the United Nations Development Assistance Framework) to become the most important planning and implementation instrument for the United Nations development system response to national needs and priorities in countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and thereby provide a contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. According to the new United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, the United Nations country teams are mandated to support Member States in four interlinked areas: (a) sustainable development; (b) human rights; (c) peace and democracy; and (d) natural disaster prevention and response capability (resilience). This mandate involves supporting Member States in respecting, promoting, implementing and reporting on their obligations and commitments under the international norms and standards that the United Nations system upholds, including human rights instruments and international labour standards. The normative work that ILO undertakes within its mandate to support ILO members in complying with and reporting on international labour conventions and recommendations is fundamental to anchoring the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework inside the norms and standards of the United Nations. For example, the workplan in the framework of a specific United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework on inclusive growth and decent work could include ILO support on implementing ratified international labour conventions based on comments and decisions of the supervisory mechanisms, including the conclusions of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference. Pursuing the normative agenda and the universal values that bind the United Nations must continue to be a priority of collective United Nations action at the country level, including through the engagement of the resident coordinators. Consequently, the social partners and ILO are closely interlinked in the process and will actively contribute to the good functioning of the new framework process. In his letter dated 7 November 2018, addressed to the Director General of ILO, the Secretary-General stated his conviction that the reform process would lead to greater inter-agency cross-fertilization in support of the development priorities of countries, in turn expanding opportunities for the specific skill sets of specialized agencies such as ILO. The close link between the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework and the ILO decent work country programme needs to be stressed. Such programmes follow two objectives: (a) promotion of decent work as a key component of national development strategies; and (b) the organization of ILO knowledge, instruments, advocacy and cooperation at the service of tripartite constituents. The programme is conducted within a results-based framework in order to advance the decent work agenda within the fields of comparative advantage of ILO. 5/12 A/74/292 Tripartism and social dialogue, and hence the voices of workers and employers, are central to the planning and implementation of a coherent and integrated ILO programme. Decent work country programmes are the distinct ILO contribution to United Nations country programmes and constitute one of the main instruments to better integrate regular budget and extrabudgetary technical cooperation. 5. Relations with United Nations agencies and United Nations processes The International Trade Union Confederation is deeply involved in and contributes to the work of the United Nations. 5.1. Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals Through its mandate, that universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice, ILO, as well as the International Trade Union Confederation in its role as one of its constituents, are crucial to promoting and advancing the entire 2030 Agenda and touch upon all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The decent work agenda is a driver of sustainable development and as such helps to advance many of the Goals. As a consequence, the International Trade Union Confederation has proven to be a reliable partner in activities essential to the achievement of the Goals. Furthermore, ILO development cooperation is now based on the promotion of the 2030 Agenda. The elaboration and implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals constitute strategic priorities for the International Trade Union Confederation, which contributed to the elaboration of the 2030 Agenda through the post-2015 process, taking part in the deliberations of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals. The Confederation is fully involved in implementing the 2030 Agenda in the following ways: ¢ Delivering country reports on the Goals by members to monitor progress on the Goals on a yearly basis ¢ Supporting the participation of its regional organizations and national affiliates in the United Nations regional forums on the Goals ¢ Participating in the thematic and ministerial discussions and reviews of the high- level political forum (including preparatory expert group meetings) ¢ Producing evidence and showcasing the contribution of trade unions to the 2030 Agenda, as well as policy papers, such as the thematic submission to the high- level political forum on a yearly basis The International Trade Union Confederation is an organizing partner of the workers and trade unions major group, which currently co-chairs the coordination mechanism for major groups and other stakeholders with the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. ! 5.2. Economic and Social Council In the context of the work of the Economic and Social Council, the International Trade Union Confederation received consultative status in 2007. Consequently, the ' See: www.ituc-csi.org/2030A genda. 6/12 A/74/292 organization, in addition to its role as a member of ILO, is very familiar with the United Nations system and has had long-standing experience in the international diplomatic context. 5.3. Global Forum on Migration and Development and Global Compact for Migration Within the Global Forum on Migration and Development, the International Trade Union Confederation organized the voices of trade unions worldwide. The Council of Global Unions underlines the need to guarantee migrants their social and human rights and to set up regulatory frameworks that respect their fundamental rights regardless of their status. Within the framework of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, one representative of the International Trade Union Confederation spoke at United Nations Headquarters in New York in July 2018. The thematic debate was focused on the enhancement of public-private dialogue to rethink labour migration policies and international skills mobility. With the participation of the International Trade Union Confederation and the World Employment Confederation, ILO has launched a fair recruitment initiative, which is aimed at preventing human trafficking, promoting safe migration and reducing the costs of labour mobility. 5.4. Human Rights Council (Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) The International Trade Union Confederation provides important worker perspectives in the many policy initiatives and forums held in the Human Rights Council. As a tripartite member of ILO and with previous experience in addressing human and labour rights challenges in the world of work globally, the organization helps to link the work of ILO with that of the Human Rights Council. The International Trade Union Confederation ensures that workers’ voices are heard and reflected in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Confederation believes that it is the responsibility of companies, as part of the due diligence expected of them, to prevent and mitigate impacts on human rights, including workers’ rights. The organization actively advocates their interests throughout the process. The International Trade Union Confederation will continue its work with all stakeholders to see that the recommendations published in the framework of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights are put into practice. 5.5. United Nations Global Compact The International Trade Union Confederation, as an international organization, has been a crucial partner throughout the elaboration of the United Nations Global Compact. The General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, Sharan Burrow, is currently a member of the Global Compact Board. 7/12 A/74/292 5.6. Other engagement with the United Nations Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up The International Trade Union Confederation leads the engagement of trade unions in the Economic and Social Council forum on financing for development follow-up on a yearly basis, bringing delegations, contributing to the deliberations and bringing the perspectives of trade unions and workers into the negotiations on relevant documents. United Nations climate agenda The International Trade Union Confederation is actively engaged, together with its affiliates, in the United Nations climate agenda, such as the Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the twenty-first Conference of the Parties, at which the Paris Agreement on climate change was adopted, and the twenty-fourth Conference of the Parties, held in Poland, at which the parties adopted the Silesia Declaration: Solidarity and Just Transition. Trade and development (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) The ITU International Trade Union Confederation participates in the conferences and related official hearings of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and participates in its Trade and Development Commission as an observer. Commission on the Status of Women The International Trade Union Confederation regularly participates in the annual two-week session of the Commission on the Status of Women, representing trade unions in high-level panels, and in policy work with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and the Commission on Sustainable Development. The organization was also represented on the High-level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment. 6. Activities with Governments and international governmental organizations 6.1. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development The International Trade Union Confederation has close relations with global union federations and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 6.2. Group of 20 and Group of Seven The International Trade Union Confederation represents the core outreach group to the Group of 20 and the Group of Seven in terms of workers’ representation. Among other common activities, together with the International Organization of Employers, it has developed, implemented and delivered on bipartite and tripartite agreements in the context of the Group of 20 and the Group of Seven. In June 2019, for the first time, the Group of Seven agreed on a joint statement with international social partners, the International Organization of Employers/Business and Industry Advisory Committee to OECD and _ the 8/12 A/74/292 International Trade Union Confederation/Trade Union Advisory Committee to OECD, with a focus on: (a) strengthening coherence of the actions of international organizations and respect for international labour standards; (b) extending access to social protection; (c) adapting labour market institutions and promoting skills development in the new world of work; and (d) closing the gender employment, participation and pay gaps. 7. Reasons for seeking observer status for the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation The International Trade Union Confederation contributes to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals through its results-oriented membership, including a concrete impact on the ground. By granting the organization the observer status in the General Assembly, the United Nations system will strengthen its credibility as a multilateral body aimed at finding solutions through partnerships with workers’ representatives. Together with the International Organization of Employers, the International Trade Union Confederation can serve as a proactive bridge between the United Nations and the world of work, at a time when the United Nations is looking to expand partnerships. More concretely, the organization can prospectively further, as it has already furthered, as laid down in the examples above, the attainment of the goals of the United Nations, especially in the context of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, through the following approaches: (a) helping the United Nations to understand how trade unions function and the most effective outreach avenues; (b) contributing extensive knowledge and experience on different aspects of the world of work to United Nations initiatives and programmes; (c) assisting trade unions to address fundamental labour human rights violations and challenges; and (d) bringing the global voices of trade unions to global debates and dialogue on sustainable development, migration, climate change, gender empowerment, youth integration and conflict prevention. In the context of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals, the International Trade Union Confederation shares the same goal, namely to provide a better and sustainable future for all human beings, which is also often the goal of workers. As such, their voices are well represented by the International Trade Union Confederation, which is an organization that internationally coordinates the voices of workers around the globe. Furthermore, the reform of the United Nations development system calls for the stronger representation of workers in the United Nations system. The International Trade Union Confederation will contribute significantly to the aim of improving the accountability, efficiency and coherence of the United Nations development system, including by providing a valuable challenge function. In this regard, the contribution of the International Trade Union Confederation to the decision-making process of ILO has to be mentioned once more. As international social partners, the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation represent 50 per cent of the eligible voters within ILO, and their voices have been indispensable for the consent and contribution of ILO to the United Nations reform process. In his letter, mentioned above, the Secretary-General thanked all ILO tripartite constituents for their collaboration. Finally, the International Trade Union Confederation, owing to its long-standing membership and continuously excellent representation of workers at ILO, is best 9/12 A/74/292 equipped to involve their voices in United Nations forums. The General Assembly is a crucial focal point where the organization could contribute with its policymaking expertise in the context of trade unions in all regions of the world. While the requests for observer status for both the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation are submitted separately, to conform with the formal requirements of United Nations proceedings, both requests are intrinsically linked and are submitted so as to be granted observer status simultaneously. Indeed, to continue to be effective, both organizations need to continue to be able to act jointly at the global level. 8. Conclusion The International Trade Union Confederation and its member federations represent the consolidated voice of unions throughout the process of shaping United Nations policy. The above elaborated connections between the international representative of workers federations and the United Nations has made it evident that, for the successful achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, considering the expertise of the organization is crucial. As a representative of workers federations, it is, above all, critical in influencing local policy. It plays a key role in the negotiations, implementation of and follow-up to the 2030 Agenda at the United Nations and at the country level. Furthermore, workers’ organizations often join with employers’ organizations through social dialogue and partnership, which are key for social stability and democracy. As the representative of workers within ILO, the International Trade Union Confederation, together with the employers’ representative, the International Organization of Employers, represent 50 per cent of the eligible voters and hence are crucial to the decision-making process at ILO, a specialized United Nations agency. Being part of the tripartite structure of ILO, the International Trade Union Confederation can, in addition to working to fulfil the ILO mandate, determine the position of ILO within the United Nations Sustainable Development Group. It is the intention of the organization to use the momentum and to support the United Nations in the implementation process of the 2030 Agenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Simultaneously, the organization will intensify its communications and strengthen its efficient and effective working relations with the United Nations. 10/12 A/74/292 Annex IT Letter dated 12 July 2019 from the Director General of the International Labour Organization On behalf of the International Labour Organization (ILO), I would like to express my support for the request by the International Organization of Employers and the International Trade Union Confederation for observer status in the General Assembly.
