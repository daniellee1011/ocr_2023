or impairment of human rights and as such is unacceptable, Reiterating the need to intensify efforts at all levels to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violence against women and girls is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between women and men, and that all forms of violence against women and girls seriously violate and impair or nullify their enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability of women and girls to make use of their capabilities, Recalling that the threat of violence, including all forms of harassment, is a permanent constraint on the mobility of women and girls, limits their access to resources, services and basic activities, and impedes their economic and political empowerment, Emphasizing the need for States, and all segments of society, including civil society organizations, the private sector and media, as well as community leaders, including tribal leaders, and religious leaders to take meaningful steps to promote the empowerment of women and girls in order to achieve gender equality and to strongly condemn and address attitudes and behaviours that perpetuate violence against women and girls, Stressing that any custom, tradition or religious consideration should not be invoked by States

order to break the intergenerational cycles of violence, Recognizing that poverty and lack of empowerment of women, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies

health, including their sexual and reproductive health, and for the enjoyment of their human rights, and that respecting and promoting sexual and reproductive health, and protecting and fulfilling
