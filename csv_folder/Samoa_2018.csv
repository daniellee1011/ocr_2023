Uruguay",N/A,Improving global road safety,"The General Assembly, Recalling its resolutions 57/309 of 22 May 2003, 58/9 of 5 November 2003, 58/289 of 14 April 2004, 60/5 of 26 October 2005, 62/244 of 31 March 2008, 64/255 of 2 March 2010, 66/260 of 19 April 2012, 68/269 of 10 April 2014 and 70/260 of 15 April 2016, on improving global road safety, Having considered the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report on improving global road safety! and the recommendations contained therein, Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of this Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions — economic, social and environmental — in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, Recalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and acknowledging the importance of reaching the road safety-related targets, such as target 3.6, which aims to halve, by 2020, the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, and target 11.2, which aims to provide, by 2030, access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older ' A/72/359, Please recycle ae a 18-05464 1 100418 A A A A persons, as well as road safety targets aimed at strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity vis-a-vis hazards and developing sustainable and resilient infrastructure, Noting that, as the end of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 is approaching, the overwhelming majority of road traffic deaths and injuries are preventable and that, despite some improvements in many countries, including in developing countries, they remain a major public health and development problem that has broad social and economic consequences which, if unaddressed, may affect progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Recognizing that human suffering, combined with costs to some countries of up to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product a year, makes reducing road traffic deaths and injuries both an economic and a social priority, especially for some countries, and that investment in road safety has a positive impact on public health and the economy, Taking into account that road traffic deaths and injuries are also a social equity issue, as the poor and the vulnerable are most frequently also vulnerable road users, namely, pedestrians, cyclists, users of motorized two- and three-wheeled vehicles and passengers of unsafe public transport, who are disproportionately affected and exposed to risks and road crashes, which can lead to a cycle of poverty exacerbated by income loss, and recalling that the aim of road safety policies should be to guarantee protection to all users, Recognizing that road safety requires addressing broader issues of equitable access to mobility and that the promotion of sustainable modes of transport, in particular safe public transport and safe walking and cycling, is a key element of road safety, Taking into account the importance of strengthening institutional capacity and continuing international cooperation, including South-South and_ triangular cooperation, cooperation between countries that share roads across borders and cooperation among regional and international organizations, to further support efforts to improve road safety, particularly in developing countries, and providing, as appropriate, support to meet the goals of the Decade of Action and those of the 2030 Agenda, Emphasizing that, while each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the context of reaching the Sustainable Development Goals, international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources, Expressing its concern that the number of road traffic crashes remains unacceptably high, and crashes represent a leading cause of death and injury around the world, killing more than 1.3 million people and injuring as many as 50 million people a year, with 90 per cent of these casualties occurring in developing countries, and concerned also that road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death around the world for children and young people between 15 and 29 years of age, Expressing its concern also that at the current rate of progress, target 3.6 will not be met, Expressing its concern further that the adoption and implementation of road safety measures remain inadequate in many countries, Acknowledging the leading role of Oman and the Russian Federation in drawing the attention of the international community to the global road safety crisis, 2/9 Commending Member States that have taken a leadership role by adopting comprehensive legislation on key risk factors, including the non-use of seat belts, child restraints and helmets, the drinking of alcohol and driving, and speeding, and drawing attention to other risk factors, such as low visibility, medical conditions and medicines that affect safe driving, fatigue and the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic and psychoactive substances, mobile phones and other electronic and texting devices, Encouraging Member States to promote multi-stakeholder partnerships to address the safety of vulnerable road users, the delivery of first aid to victims of road accidents or crashes, training and education, notably in developing and least developed countries, Recognizing the progress made by some Member States in providing road traffic crash victims and their families with universal access to health care in the pre-hospital, hospital, post-hospital and rehabilitation and reintegration phases, Acknowledging the work of the United Nations system, in particular the leadership of the World Health Organization, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, in establishing, implementing and monitoring various aspects of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020), and the commitment of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the International Labour Organization, among other entities, to supporting those efforts as well as that of the World Bank and regional development banks to implementing road safety projects and programmes, in particular in developing countries, Commending the World Health Organization for its leadership role in preventing road traffic injury and for its role in implementing the mandate conferred upon it by the General Assembly to act, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, as a coordinator on road safety issues within the United Nations system,” and anticipating the next Global Status Report on Road Safety, which will be the fourth in a series of reports to monitor progress over the period of the Decade of Action, as requested in Assembly resolution 62/244, Commending also the United Nations regional commissions for their work in increasing road safety activities and advocating increased political commitment to road safety, and in working towards setting regional and national road traffic casualty reduction targets, in particular the work of the Economic Commission for Europe in elaborating global road safety-related legal instruments, including international conventions and agreements, technical standards, resolutions and good practice recommendations, as well as in servicing 58 global and regional legal instruments that provide a commonly accepted legal and technical framework for the development of international road, rail, inland water and combined transport, Emphasizing the role of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration as a consultative mechanism to facilitate international road safety cooperation, Commending the work of two Economic

report of the International Transport Forum of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development entitled Zero Road Deaths and Serious Injuries: Leading a Paradigm Shift to a Safe System, and the letter of intent of the International Transport Forum, the World Bank and the International Automobile Federation to develop regional road safety data observatories, and noting the promotion by the International Transport Forum of effective road injury prevention at the forthcoming Summit on Transport Safety and Security, to be held in Leipzig, Germany, from 23 to 25 May 2018, Recognizing

their continued commitment to road safety, as demonstrated by their observance of the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on the third Sunday of November every year, Acknowledging the efforts of Member States in contributing to international road safety by conducting research and collecting evidence that will inform policies, as well as by encouraging the sharing of best practices that enhance vehicle and infrastructure safety as well as human behaviour in road traffic, Recognizing that providing basic conditions and services to address road safety is primarily a responsibility of Governments, especially in view of the decisive role that legislative bodies can play in the adoption of comprehensive and effective road safety policies and laws and their implementation, while recognizing nonetheless that there is a shared responsibility to move towards a world free from road traffic fatalities and serious injuries and that addressing road safety demands 4/9 multi-stakeholder collaboration among the public and private sectors, academia, professional organizations, non-governmental organizations and the media, Commending the World Health Organization,

Welcomes the following set of international rules, norms and principles of responsible behaviour of States: 1. States should comply with the Charter of the United Nations and universally recognized norms governing international relations that enshrine, inter alia, respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all States, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the diversity of history, culture and social systems of all countries. 2. Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of information and communications technologies and to prevent practices relating to such technologies that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security. 3. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to carry out activities which run counter to the task of maintaining international peace and security. 4. States should not use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability, and reaffirm the right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news, which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other States or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, cooperation and friendly relations among States and nations. 5. States should recognize the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States. 6. States should endeavour to ensure at all levels of the supply chain the security of information and communications technology goods and services, in order to prevent other States from exploiting their dominant position in information and communications technologies, including dominance in resources, critical infrastructures, core technologies, information and communications technology goods and services and information and 3/7 communications networks, to undermine the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services, or to threaten their political, economic and social security. 7. States should reaffirm the rights and responsibilities of all States, in accordance with the relevant norms and rules, regarding legal protection of their information space and critical information infrastructure against damage resulting from threats, interference, attack and sabotage. 8. States should recognize that the rights of an individual in the offline environment must also be protected in the online environment; and fully respect rights and freedoms in the information space, including the right and freedom to seek, receive and impart information, taking into account the fact that article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights* attaches to that right special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals; 9. All States must play the same role in, and carry equal responsibility for, international governance of the Internet, its security, continuity and stability of operation, and its development in a way which promotes the establishment of multilateral, transparent and democratic international Internet governance mechanisms which ensure an equitable distribution of resources, facilitate access for all and ensure the stable and secure functioning of the Internet. 10. States must meet their international obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. However, the indication that an information and communications technology activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the information and communications technology infrastructure of a State may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that State. States should note that accusations of organizing and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated. In case of information and communications technology incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the information and communications technology environment and the nature and extent of the consequences. 11. States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies. States must not use proxies to commit internationally wrongful acts using information and communications technologies and should seek to ensure that their territory is not used by non-State actors to commit such acts. 12. States should consider how best to cooperate to exchange information, assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of information and communications technologies and curb the dissemination of information that incites terrorism, separatism or extremism or that inflames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious grounds, and implement other cooperative measures to address such threats. States may need to consider whether new measures need to be developed in this respect. 4/7 13. States, in ensuring the secure use of information and communications technologies, should respect Human Rights Council resolutions 20/8 of 5 July 2012° and 26/13 of 26 June 2014° on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, as well as General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and 69/166 of 18 December 2014 on the right to privacy in the digital age, to guarantee full respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. 14. A State should not conduct or knowingly support information and communications technology activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public. 15. States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from information and communications technology threats, taking into account General Assembly resolution 58/199 of 23 December 2003 on the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, and other relevant resolutions. 16. States should respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another State whose critical infrastructure is subject to malicious acts using information and communications technologies. States should also respond to appropriate requests to mitigate malicious information and communications technology activity aimed at the critical infrastructure of another State emanating from their territory, taking into account due regard for sovereignty. 17. States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of information and communications technology products, and the right of States to independent control of information and communications technology goods and services should not be undermined or their political, economic and social security threatened. 18. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious information and communications technology tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions. 19. States should encourage responsible reporting of information and communications technology vulnerabilities and share associated information on available remedies for such vulnerabilities to limit and possibly eliminate potential threats to information and communications technologies and infrastructure dependent on such technologies. 20. States should not conduct or knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams (sometimes known as computer emergency response teams or cybersecurity incident response teams) of another State. A State should not use authorized emergency response teams to engage in malicious international activity. 21. States should encourage the private sector and civil society to play an appropriate role to improve security of and in the use of information and communications technologies, including supply chain security for information and communications technology products and services. States should cooperate with the private sector and the organizations of civil society in the sphere of > See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 53 and corrigendum (A/67/53 and A/67/53/Corr.1), chap.

A. 5/7 implementation of rules of responsible behaviour in information space with regard to their potential role. 22. States should develop confidence-building measures aimed at increasing predictability and reducing the likelihood of misunderstanding and the risk of conflict.
