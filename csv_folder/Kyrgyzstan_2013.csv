In accordance with rule 20 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, an explanatory note in support of this request (annex I)",N/A,I should be grateful if you would have the present letter and its annexes circulated as a document of the General Assembly.,"(Signed) T. T. Kydyrov Permanent Representative of the Kyrgyz Republic to the United Nations 21061 13-36491 nl CNC NA il i A/68/143 Annex I Explanatory note to the General Assembly resolution on “The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia” During the second half of the twentieth century, a number of environmental problems arose in the Central Asian countries as a result of the region becoming the main source of raw materials for uranium ore extraction and processing in the former Soviet Union. The uranium industry was under centralized State control. The flow of information on uranium production was strictly controlled from the top down by the relevant bodies of the Soviet Union’s Ministry of Medium Machine-Building Industry. Companies were secure facilities, extraction companies did not keep archival information on extraction and processing technologies and there was no horizontal data sharing among the different industrial plants. All organizations in the sector applied identical regulatory standards (safety standards) to control irradiation and radioactive contamination at uranium ore extraction and processing sites, thereby reducing the administrative burden imposed. Radiation safety standards were comparable with similar standards in Europe and the United States of America in the 1960s and 1970s. However, a bonus system provided many incentives to enhance production indicators, while insufficient attention was paid to environmental safety and health issues. In order to address the problems caused by the legacy of industrial uranium extraction and processing practices in the Central Asian States, the historical features of the uranium industry’s development in the region should be considered, as well as the prevailing conditions in the Central Asian republics since independence. During the transition period, with its economic, political and social problems, the technical conditions for radioactive waste management deteriorated, which increased the risk of possible accidents. There was a real danger of pollution of the groundwater and rivers of the water basin throughout Central Asia, which would have major consequences not only for millions of people and the environment, but also for the whole sustainable development process in the countries of the region. It could take several decades and significant financial resources to mitigate the consequences of such accidents and disasters. In this connection, the Kyrgyz Republic, in conjunction with other Central Asian States, is actively engaged in efforts at the international level to avert the radioactive threat posed by uranium tailings ponds. The joint appeal made by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Secretariat of the Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to Governments, international financial institutions, private sector representatives and other organizations, signed in the Kyrgyz Republic in September 2007, provided a framework for the consolidation of efforts to reduce the risk posed by radioactive waste to people and the environment, the strengthening of sustainable development in the Central Asian countries, and the mobilization of donor assistance from international organizations and the private sector. A/68/143 Subsequent to the above appeal, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan, in cooperation with UNDP and other international organizations, organized a high- level international forum “Uranium tailings: local problems, regional consequences, global solution”, which was held in Geneva on 24 June 2009. The joint declaration, issued by the International Forum and adopted by the Central Asian States, UNDP, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and EURASEC, noted the importance of regional cooperation in the following priority areas: improvement of the legislative framework, rehabilitation and elimination of tailings ponds, development and implementation of special programmes and projects to improve monitoring, and the implementation of health and humanitarian measures to enhance the quality and standards of living of the population living in the regions where the tailings ponds are located. It is clear that the main problems relating to the legacy of uranium in the region can only be resolved with targeted and coordinated assistance from the international community. The Kyrgyz Republic hopes that the increased attention and interest of the international community in these issues will lead to successful management of the national and regional environmental risks and prevention of a humanitarian crisis, while ensuring sustainable development in the Central Asian States and eliminating the risk of radioactive waste being used for extremist and terrorist purposes. For that very reason, in order to address the problem of ensuring environmental safety and sustainable development in the region, the Kyrgyz Republic has prepared a General Assembly resolution on “The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia”. A/68/143 Annex IT Draft resolution The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia The General Assembly, Taking into account the results of the high-level international forum “Uranium tailings: local problems, regional consequences, global solution”, held in Geneva on 26 June 2009, Attaching particular importance to the protection of human health and the guarantee of fundamental human rights through the prevention of potential natural and man-made disasters, for the current and future generations, Noting that numerous burial sites for uranium waste and other extremely dangerous radioactive processing wastes are located in densely populated areas of the Central Asian countries, Noting also that many tailings ponds are located in seismically active areas close to population centres and the banks of major rivers in the region, and are subject to the threat of land and mud slides, Considering that, despite the efforts made by the States of Central Asia at the national level, and also the support of international programs and projects to recultivate former uranium mines and tailings ponds, a number of States continue to have serious social, economic and environmental problems, Striving to contribute to strengthening the integrity and safety of radioactive materials, Taking into account that the Governments and peoples of the Central Asian States are aware of the threat of possible natural or man-made disasters and their global consequences for the lives and health of a large number of people and the environment, 1. Notes the paramount importance of rehabilitation of the areas affected by uranium extraction plants; 2. Recognizes the need to devise and promote effective programmes and projects for the sustainable management of radioactive and toxic waste in Central Asia; 3. Also recognizes the role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia and emphasizes the importance of adopting preventive and other measures to resolve the problem of radioactive and toxic waste and completely rehabilitate the polluted areas in accordance with the highest safety standards and best global practice; 4. Calls on the international community to assist the States of Central Asia in resolving the problems of uranium tailings ponds and emphasizes the importance of regional cooperation in the following priority areas: improvement of the legislative framework, management and maintenance at safe levels of uranium waste and other radiation tailings ponds, rehabilitation and elimination of tailings ponds, A/68/143 development and implementation of special programmes and projects to improve the monitoring of their safety, raising public awareness, taking measures to prevent people from gaining access to polluted materials, implementing health and humanitarian measures to enhance the quality and standard of living of the population in the regions where the tailings ponds are located; 5. Further calls on the international community to continue active sharing of experience and knowledge so as effectively to resolve the problems of uranium, radiation and toxic tailings ponds; 6. Expresses support for the efforts made by the States of Central Asia in devising and implementing their country programmes, and also for the intention of States in the region to hold further bilateral and multilateral negotiations to prevent the radiation threat in Central Asia. 13-36491",06/13/2013,2013_751190,Kyrgyzstan,N/A,yes

Welcomes the report of the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights,' as well as his work and contributions; 2. Recalls the endorsement of the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 20/10 of 5 July 2012, of the Guiding Principles on Foreign Debt and Human Rights;” 3. Reiterates its encouragement to all Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, as well as the private sector, to take into consideration the guiding principles when designing policies and programmes; 4. Also reiterates its request to the Independent Expert to develop a commentary to the guiding principles by inviting comments from States, international financial institutions, regional economic commissions, civil society organizations, the private sector and academia; 5. Recalls that every State has the primary responsibility to promote the economic, social and cultural development of its people and, to that end, has the right and ' A/ARC/23/37. > A/JHRC/20/23. A/HRC/23/L.22 responsibility to choose its means and goals of development and should not be subject to external specific prescriptions for economic policy; 6. Recognizes that structural adjustment reform programmes and _ policy conditionalities limit public expenditure, impose fixed expenditure ceilings and give inadequate attention to the provision of social services, and that only a few countries manage to achieve sustainable higher growth under these programmes; 7. Reaffirms the fact that responses to the global financial and economic crises should not result in a decrease in debt relief, nor should they be used as an excuse to stop debt relief measures, as that would have negative implications for the enjoyment of human rights in affected countries; 8. Expresses its concern that the level of implementation and the reduction of overall debt stock under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative are still low, and that the Initiative is not intended to offer a comprehensive solution to the long- term debt burden; 9. Reiterates its conviction that, for heavily indebted poor countries to achieve debt sustainability, long-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the debt relief under the above-mentioned Initiative will not be sufficient and that additional resource transfers, in the form of grants and concessional loans and the removal of trade barriers and better prices for their exports, would be required to ensure sustainability and permanent exit from debt overhang; 10. Regrets the absence of mechanisms to find appropriate solutions to the unsustainable foreign debt burden of low- and middle-income heavily indebted countries, and that, to date, little headway has been made in redressing the unfairness of the current system of debt resolution, which continues to place the interests of the lenders above those of indebted countries and the poor in those countries, and therefore calls for an intensification of efforts to devise effective and equitable mechanisms to cancel or reduce substantially the foreign debt burden of all developing countries, in particular those severely affected by the devastation of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes, and by armed conflicts; 11. Affirms that, from a human rights perspective, the settlement of excessive vulture funds has a direct negative effect on the capacity of Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights; 12. Also affirms that the activities of vulture funds highlight some of the problems in the global financial system and are indicative of the unjust nature of the current system, and calls upon States to take measures to combat those funds; 13. Acknowledges that, in least developed countries and in several low- and middle-income countries, unsustainable levels of external debt continue to create a considerable barrier to economic and social development and increase the risk that the Millennium Development Goals for development and poverty reduction will not be attained; 14. Recognizes that debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that should be directed towards activities consistent with attaining sustainable growth and development, including poverty reduction and the achievement of the development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and therefore that debt relief measures, where appropriate, should be pursued vigorously and expeditiously, ensuring that they do not replace alternative sources of financing and that they are accompanied by an increase in official development assistance; A/HRC/23/L.22 15. Recalls once again the call on industrialized countries, as expressed in the Millennium Declaration, to implement the enhanced programme of debt relief without further delay and to agree to cancel all official bilateral debts of those countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction; 16. Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, the Bretton Woods institutions and the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the pledges, commitments, agreements and decisions of major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the World Conference on Human Rights, the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the World Conference on Sustainable Development and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in particular those relating to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries, in particular of heavily indebted poor countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition; 17. Recalls the pledge contained in the Political Declaration annexed to General Assembly resolution S-24/2, adopted on 1 July 2000 by the Assembly, to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt- servicing burdens of developing countries; 18. Stresses the need for the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for any negotiations and conclusion of debt relief and new loan agreements to be formulated with public knowledge and transparency, with legislative frameworks, institutional arrangements and mechanisms for consultation being established to ensure the effective participation of all components of society, including people’s legislative bodies and human rights institutions, and particularly of the most vulnerable or disadvantaged, in the design, application and evaluation of strategies, policies and programmes, as well as in the follow-up to and systematic national supervision of their implementation, and for macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and in a consistent way, in the realization of broader social development goals, taking into account the national context and the priorities and needs of the debtor countries to allocate resources in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of human rights; 19. Stresses that the economic reform programmes arising from foreign debt should maximize the policy space of developing countries in pursuing their national development efforts, taking into account the views of relevant stakeholders in a way that ensures balanced development conducive to the overall realization of all human rights; 20. Also stresses that the economic programmes arising from foreign debt relief and cancellation must not reproduce past structural adjustment policies that have not worked, such as dogmatic demands for privatization and reduced public services; 21. Calls upon States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue to cooperate closely to ensure that additional resources made available through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other new initiatives are absorbed in the recipient countries without affecting ongoing programmes; 22. Calls upon creditors, particularly international financial institutions, and debtors alike to consider the preparation of human rights impact assessments with regard to development projects, loan agreements or poverty reduction strategy papers; 23. Reaffirms the fact that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy A/HRC/23/L.22 environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment policies, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 24. Urges States, international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by HIV/AIDS so that more financial resources may be released and used for health care, research and treatment of the population in the affected countries; 25. Reiterates its view that, in order to find a durable solution to the debt problem and for the consideration of any new debt resolution mechanism, there is a need for a broad political dialogue between creditor and debtor countries and the multilateral financial institutions, within the United Nations system, based on the principle of shared interests and responsibilities; 26. Reiterates its request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to pay more attention to the problem of the debt burden of developing countries, in particular of least developed countries, and especially the social impact of the measures arising from foreign debt; 27. Requests the Independent Expert to continue to explore the interlinkages with trade and other issues, including HIV/AIDS, when examining the impact of structural adjustment and foreign debt, and also to contribute, as appropriate, to the process entrusted with the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development with a view to bringing to its attention the issue of the effects of structural adjustment and foreign debt on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 28. | Encourages the Independent Expert to continue to cooperate, in accordance with his mandate, with the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, special rapporteurs, independent experts and members of the expert working groups of the Human Rights Council and its Advisory Committee on issues relating to economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development in his work; 29.

(Signed) Talaibek Kydyrov Permanent Representative of the Kyrgyz Republic to the United Nations 230913 13-47837 iil 240913 AMY A AA A/68/143/Rev.1 Annex I Explanatory note Draft General Assembly resolution on “The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia” From the 1940s to the 1970s, the Central Asian region was the centre of uranium ore extraction and processing in the former Soviet Union, a situation which generated a significant accumulation of uranium production waste. In the 1990s and at the beginning of the twenty-first century, preventive and emergency repair work at uranium production facilities was not done on a sufficient scale owing to a lack of funding; as a result, most of those facilities were exposed to weathering processes, and that has now become the cause of environmental problems in the region. The uranium industry was under centralized State control. The flow of information on uranium production was strictly controlled from the top down by the relevant bodies of the Soviet Union’s Ministry of Medium Machine-Building Industry. Companies were secure facilities, extraction companies did not keep archival information on extraction and processing technologies and there was no horizontal data sharing among the different industrial plants. All organizations in the sector applied identical regulatory standards (safety standards) to control irradiation and radioactive contamination at uranium ore extraction and processing sites, thereby reducing the administrative burden imposed. Radiation safety standards were comparable with similar standards in Europe and the United States of America in the 1960s and 1970s. However, a bonus system provided many incentives to enhance production indicators, while insufficient attention was paid to environmental safety and health issues. In order to address the problems caused by the legacy of industrial uranium extraction and processing practices in the Central Asian States, the historical features of the uranium industry’s development in the region should be considered, as well as the prevailing conditions in the Central Asian republics since independence. During the transition period, with its economic, political and social problems, the technical conditions for radioactive waste management deteriorated, which increased the risk of possible accidents. There was a real danger of pollution of the groundwater and rivers of the water basin throughout Central Asia, which would have major consequences not only for millions of people and the environment, but also for the whole sustainable development process in the countries of the region. It could take several decades and significant financial resources to mitigate the consequences of such accidents and disasters. In this connection, the Kyrgyz Republic, in conjunction with other Central Asian States, is actively engaged in efforts at the international level to avert the radioactive threat posed by uranium tailings ponds. The joint appeal made by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Secretariat of the Eurasian Economic Community and the United Nations Development Programme to Governments, international financial institutions, private sector representatives and other organizations, signed in the Kyrgyz Republic in September 2007, provided a 2/5 A/68/143/Rev.1 framework for the consolidation of efforts to reduce the risk posed by radioactive waste to people and the environment, the strengthening of sustainable development in the Central Asian countries, and the mobilization of donor assistance from international organizations and the private sector. Subsequent to the above appeal, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme and other international organizations, organized a high-level international forum “Uranium tailings: local problems, regional consequences, global solution”, which was held in Geneva on 24 June 2009. The joint declaration, issued by the International Forum and adopted by the Central Asian States, the United Nations Development Programme, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Eurasian Economic Community, noted the importance of regional cooperation in the following priority areas: improvement of the legislative framework, rehabilitation and elimination of tailings ponds, development and implementation of special programmes and projects to improve monitoring, and the implementation of health and humanitarian measures to enhance the quality and standards of living of the population living in the regions where the tailings ponds are located. The resolution adopted at the international conference on “Uranium Tailings in Central Asia: Joint Efforts to Reduce Risks”, held in Bishkek on 24 and 25 October 2012, confirmed the relevance of the conclusions and priorities jointly developed and agreed upon during the Geneva international high-level forum. From 2000 to 2013, with the direct participation and financial support of organizations such as the United Nations, the Eurasian Economic Community, Rosatom, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, the World Bank and the International Science and Technology Centre, and also the Governments of the Russian Federation, the Swiss Confederation, the Czech Republic and other countries, consultative analysis and rehabilitation work was done on the tailings ponds in the areas of Ming-Kush, Kajy-Say, Mayluu-Suu, Ak-tiiz, Shekaftar, Sumsar and Kan in the Kyrgyz Republic. It is clear that the main problems relating to the legacy of uranium in the region can only be resolved with targeted and coordinated assistance from the international community. The Kyrgyz Republic hopes that the increased attention and interest of the international community in these issues will lead to successful management of the national and regional environmental risks and prevention of a humanitarian crisis, while ensuring sustainable development in the Central Asian States. For that very reason, in order to address the problem of ensuring environmental safety and sustainable development in the region, the Kyrgyz Republic has prepared a General Assembly resolution on “The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia”. 3/5 A/68/143/Rev.1 Annex IT Draft resolution The role of the international community in the prevention of the radiation threat in Central Asia The General Assembly, Taking into account the outcome of the high-level international forum “Uranium tailings: local problems, regional consequences, global solution”, held in Geneva on 26 June 2009, Taking into account also the outcome of the international conference on “Uranium Tailings in Central Asia: Joint Efforts to Reduce Risks”, held in Bishkek on 24 and 25 October 2012, Attaching particular importance to the protection of human health and the guarantee of fundamental human rights through the prevention of potential natural and man-made disasters, for the current and future generations, Noting that numerous burial sites for uranium waste and other extremely hazardous radioactive processing wastes are located in densely populated areas of the Central Asian countries, Noting also that many tailings ponds are located in seismically active areas close to population centres and the banks of major rivers in the region, and are subject to the threat of land and mud slides, Considering that, despite the efforts made by the States of Central Asia at the national level, and also the support of international programs and projects to recultivate former uranium mines and tailings ponds, a number of States continue to have serious social, economic and environmental problems, Striving to contribute to strengthening the integrity and safety of radioactive materials, Expressing gratitude to the Russian Federation, the Swiss Confederation and other countries, and also to international organizations and regional integration associations, including the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Eurasian Economic Community and the World Bank, which are providing assistance in addressing the problems of uranium tailings ponds in the Central Asian region, Taking into account that the Governments and peoples of the Central Asian States are aware of the threat of possible natural or man-made disasters and their global consequences for the lives and health of a large number of people and the environment, 1.

Reaffirms that hunger constitutes an outrage and a violation of human dignity and therefore requires the adoption of urgent measures at the national, regional and international levels for its elimination; 8 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document CL 144/9 (C 2013/20), appendix D. 3/8 2. Also reaffirms the right of everyone to have access to safe, sufficient and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, so as to be able to fully develop and maintain his or her physical and mental capacities; 3. Considers it intolerable that, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund, more than one third of the children who die every year before the age of 5 die from hunger-related illness, that, as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about 842 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hunger and that an additional 1 billion people are suffering from serious malnutrition, including as a result of the global food crisis, while, according to the latter organization, the planet could produce enough food to feed everyone around the world; 4. Expresses its concern at the fact that the effects of the world food crisis continue to have serious consequences for the poorest and most vulnerable people, particularly in developing countries, which have been further aggravated by the world financial and economic crisis, and at the particular effects of this crisis on many net food-importing countries, especially on least developed countries; 5. | Expresses its deep concern that, according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations entitled The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2013, the number of hungry people in the world remains unacceptably high and that the vast majority of hungry people live in developing countries; 6. Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food and nutrition insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 7. Encourages all States to take action to address gender inequality and discrimination against women, in particular where they contribute to the malnutrition of women and girls, including measures to ensure the full and equal realization of the right to food and ensuring that women have equal access to resources, including income, land and water and their ownership and agricultural inputs, as well as full and equal access to health care, education, science and technology, to enable them to feed themselves and their families, and in this regard stresses the need to empower women and strengthen their role in decision-making; 8. | Encourages the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to food to continue mainstreaming a gender perspective in the fulfilment of his mandate, and encourages the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and all other United Nations bodies and mechanisms addressing the right to food and food insecurity to integrate a gender perspective into their relevant policies, programmes and activities; 9.

Recognizes the advances reached through South-South cooperation in developing countries and regions in connection with food security and the development of agricultural production for the full realization of the right to food; 13. Stresses that improving access to productive resources and public investment in rural development are essential for eradicating hunger and poverty, in particular in developing countries, including through the promotion of investments, including private investments, in appropriate small-scale irrigation and water management technologies in order to reduce vulnerability to droughts; 14. Recognizes the critical contribution made by the fisheries sector to the realization of the right to food and to food security, and the contribution of small-scale fishers to the local food security of coastal communities; 15. Also recognizes that 80 per cent of hungry people live in rural areas and 50 per cent are small-scale farm-holders, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food insecurity, given the increasing cost of inputs and the fall in farm incomes; that access to land, water, seeds and other natural resources is an increasing challenge for poor producers; that sustainable and gender-sensitive agricultural policies are important tools for promoting land and agrarian reform, rural credit and insurance, technical assistance and other associated measures to achieve food security and rural development; and that support by States for small farmers, fishing communities and local enterprises, including through the facilitation of access of their products to national and international markets and empowerment of small producers, particularly women, in value chains, is a key element for food security and the provision of the right to food; 16. Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa;9 17. Urges States that have not yet done so to favourably consider becoming parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity!° and to consider becoming parties to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture!! as a matter of priority; 18. Recalls the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, !? acknowledges that many indigenous organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples have expressed in different forums their deep concerns over the obstacles and challenges they face in achieving the full enjoyment of the right to 9 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 1954, No. 33480. 10 Jbid., vol. 1760, No. 30619. 5/8 food, and calls upon States to take special actions to combat the root causes of the disproportionately high level of hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples and the continuous discrimination against them; 19. Notes the need to further examine various concepts such as, inter alia, “food sovereignty” and their relation with food security and the right to food, bearing in mind the need to avoid any negative impact on the enjoyment of the right to food for all people at all times; 20. Requests all States and private actors, as well as _ international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 21. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 22. Takes note with appreciation of the growing movement, in different regions of the world, towards the adoption of framework laws, national strategies and measures in support of the full realization of the right to food for all; 23. Stresses the need to make efforts to mobilize and optimize the allocation and utilization of technical and financial resources from all sources, including external debt relief for developing countries, and to reinforce national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 24. Calls for the early conclusion and a successful, development-oriented outcome of the Doha Round of trade negotiations of the World Trade Organization as a contribution to creating international conditions that permit the full realization of the right to food; 25. Stresses that all States should make all efforts to ensure that their international policies of a political and economic nature, including international trade agreements, do not have a negative impact on the right to food in other countries; 26. Recalls the importance of the New York Declaration on Action against Hunger and Poverty, and recommends the continuation of efforts aimed at identifying additional sources of financing for the fight against hunger and poverty, as well as non-communicable diseases; 27. Recognizes that the promises made at the World Food Summit in 1996 to halve the number of persons who are undernourished are not being fulfilled, while recognizing the efforts of Member States in this regard, and once again invites all international financial and development institutions, as well as the relevant United Nations agencies and funds, to give priority to and provide the necessary funding to realize the aim of halving by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as the right to food as set out in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the United Nations Millennium Declaration;° 6/8 28. Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 29. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 30. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 31. Also stresses that States parties to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights should consider implementing that agreement in a manner that is supportive of food security, while being mindful of the obligation of Member States to promote and protect the right to food; 32. Calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other relevant stakeholders to support national efforts aimed at responding rapidly to the food crises currently occurring across different regions, and expresses its deep concern that funding shortfalls are forcing the World Food Programme to cut operations across different regions, including Southern Africa; 33. Invites all relevant international organizations, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, to continue to promote policies and projects that have a positive impact on the right to food, to ensure that partners respect the right to food in the implementation of common projects, to support strategies of Member States aimed at the fulfilment of the right to food and to avoid any actions that could have a negative impact on the realization of the right to food; 34. Takes note with appreciation of the interim report of the Special Rapporteur; !3 35. Supports the realization of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as extended by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 13/4 of 24 March 2010; 14 36. Requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to provide all the human and financial resources necessary for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur; 37. Welcomes the work already done by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in promoting the right to adequate food, in particular its general 13 See A/68/288. 14 See Official Records of the General Assembly, Sixty-fifth Session, Supplement No. 53 and corrigendum (A/65/53 and Corr.1), chap. II, sect. A. 7/8 comment No. 12 (1999) on the right to adequate food (article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights),15 in which the Committee affirmed, inter alia, that the right to adequate food is indivisibly linked to the inherent dignity of the human person and is indispensable for the fulfilment of other human rights enshrined in the International Bill of Human Rights, and is also inseparable from social justice, requiring the adoption of appropriate economic, environmental and social policies, at both the national and the international levels, oriented to the eradication of poverty and the fulfilment of all human rights for all; 38. Recalls general comment No. 15 (2002) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the right to water (articles 11 and 12 of the Covenant), !© in which the Committee noted, inter alia, the importance of ensuring sustainable access to water resources for human consumption and agriculture in realization of the right to adequate food; 39. Reaffirms that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004,° represent a practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the achievement of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and looks forward to the holding of a meeting for a 10-year retrospective on progress made in implementing the Guidelines to mark the tenth anniversary of their adoption, at the 41st session of the Committee on World Food Security, to be held in October 2014; 40.

B. 2/13 further recalling the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective across the United Nations system in relation to the girl child, Recalling the Secretary-General’s 2008-2015 campaign “UNiTE to End Violence against Women” and the call upon Governments, civil society, women’s organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire United Nations system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls, Taking note of the appointment by the Secretary-General of the first Envoy on Youth in line with the imperative, contained in his five-year action agenda, on “Working for and with women and young people”, Recognizing that chronic poverty remains one of the biggest obstacles to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children, including the girl child, Recognizing also that urgent national and international action is required to eliminate poverty, in particular extreme poverty, and noting that the ongoing effects of the global financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those headed by girls, Recognizing further that the phenomenon of child-headed households is linked to other economic, social and political realities, such as armed conflict, natural disasters, lack of economic empowerment and health inequities, and that a comprehensive approach to these problems is needed to resolve the issue of child- headed households, Deeply concerned about the serious social problem of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, and that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, the erosion of the extended family, the exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase in the number of child- headed households, Recognizing that child-headed households may result from the death of parents and/or legal guardians, and that children can become de facto heads of households owing to parental illness, whether physical or mental, parental neglect, the migration of parents or other such factors, Deeply concerned about the extreme vulnerability of children who are heads of households, particularly girls, who may be exceptionally negatively affected by the economic and care burdens placed on them at a young age, which in turn may lead to their having difficulty completing their education and increase their vulnerability to poverty, discrimination, trafficking and physical abuse, Deeply concerned also about the vulnerability of children, in particular the girl child, raised in child-headed households, who suffer from the lack of adult support and may be particularly vulnerable to poverty, mental and psychosocial trauma and physical vulnerability owing to, inter alia, food insecurity and poor nutrition, limited access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and communicable and non-communicable diseases, Deeply concerned further that children heading households may be subjected to stigma and discrimination owing to the fact that parental death is a result of 3/13 HIV/AIDS, and that children heading households may be at greater risk of HIV because of their vulnerability to violence and exploitation as they seek to support their households, Deeply concerned that, in situations of poverty, armed conflict, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies, the incidence of child-headed households increases and makes girl children particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, abuse, exploitation and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development, Recognizing that women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and that they bear a disproportionate burden of the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including the care of and support for those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this negatively affects girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education, often resulting in their having to head households and increasing their vulnerability to the worst forms of child labour and to sexual exploitation, Noting with concern that an estimated 68 million girls?° are engaged in child labour and that many of them face the double burden of having to combine economic activities with domestic chores, which deprive them of their childhood and diminish their opportunities to benefit from education and decent employment in the future, Recognizing that the needs of girls vary, according to a number of factors, including their age, and that the risks of violence and discrimination that they face change over their life cycles, from childhood through adolescence, Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child, Recognizing further that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community, Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child, early and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the 20 International Labour Organization, Making progress against child labour — Global estimates and trends 2000-2012 (Geneva, 2013). 4/13 corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms that reinforce the lower status of girls in society, Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls is underrecognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded as a result of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities, Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition, including food allocation, and physical and mental health-care services, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful practices, such as female infanticide, child, early and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation, Taking note with appreciation of the adoption by the Human Rights Council of its resolution 24/23 of 27 September 2013 entitled “Strengthening efforts to prevent and eliminate child, early and forced marriage: challenges, achievements, best practices and implementation gaps”, Deeply concerned that, despite its widespread practice, child, early and forced marriage is still underreported, recognizing that this requires further attention and that child, early and forced marriage exposes the girl child to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often leads to premature sexual relations, early pregnancy and early childbearing and increases the risk of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity, and furthermore entails complications during pregnancy and child birth, which often lead to disability, stillbirth and maternal death, particularly for young women and girls, which require appropriate prenatal and postnatal health-care services for mothers, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, and noting with concern that this reduces girls’ opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills and is likely to have a long-term adverse impact on their employment opportunities and their and their children’s quality of life and violates and impairs the full enjoyment of their human rights, Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation in the next generation, as reaffirmed by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/146 of 20 December 2012, remains
