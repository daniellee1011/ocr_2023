Calls upon Member States, in particular malaria-endemic countries, to establish and/or strengthen national policies and operational plans, aspiring that at least 80 per cent of those at risk of or suffering from malaria may benefit from major preventive and curative interventions by 2010, in accordance with the technical recommendations of the World Health Organization, so as to ensure a reduction in the burden of malaria by at least 50 per cent by 2010 and 75 per cent by 2015; 7.
