should play an active role in addressing the world drug problem, Emphasizing the importance of the adoption of the Action Plan for the Implementation ofthe Declaration on the Guiding Principles of

links, under certain circumstances, between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production, Stressing that respect for all human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem, Ensuring that women and men benefit equally, and without any discrimination, from strategies directed against the world drug problem, through their involvement in all stages of programmes and policy-making, Recognizing that the use of the Internet poses new opportunities and challenges to international cooperation in combating drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking, and further recognizing the need for increased cooperation among States and the exchange of information, including with reference to national experiences, on how to counteract the promotion of drug abuse and the illicit drug trafficking through this instrument and on ways to use the Internet for information concerning drug demand

InthePolitical Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session,'®* Member States: (a) Recognized that demand reduction was an indispensable pillar in the global approach to countering the world drug problem and committed themselves: (i) Tointroducing into their national programmes and strategies the provisions set out in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction;"" ""7 A/54/186. '8 General Assembly resolution S-20/2, annex. 19 General Assembly resolution S-20/3, annex. A/C.3/54/L.20 (i) To working closely with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme to develop action-oriented strategies to assist in the implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction; (iii) To establishing the year 2003 as a target date for new or enhanced drug demand reduction strategies and programmes set up in close collaboration with public health, social welfare and law enforcement authorities; (iv) To achieving significant and measurable results in the field of demand reduction by 2008; (b) Called upon all States to report biennially to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs on their efforts to meet the above-mentioned goals and targets for the years 2003 and 2008. 2. The present Action Plan is offered as guidance to Member States in implementing the above-mentioned commitments. Organizations of the United Nations system,? other international organizations, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations are invited to provide support to Member States in implementing the Action Plan, according to their available resources, specific mandates and the different roles that they are to play in achieving the goals set out in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction. 3. The Action Plan reflects the emphasis in the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction on the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach involving demand reduction and supply reduction, each reinforcing the other, together with the appropriate application of the principle of shared responsibility. It stresses the need for services responsible for prevention, including law enforcement agencies, to transmit the same message and use similar language. 4. The Action Plan is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, in particular respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, human rights and fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.?! It allows for flexible approaches to reflect social, cultural, religious and political differences, and it acknowledges that efforts to reduce illicit drug demand are at different levels of implementation in different countries. 5. The Action Plan recognizes that progress to reduce the demand for illicit drugs should be seen in the context of the need for programmes to reduce the demand for substances of abuse. Such programmes should be integrated to promote cooperation between all concerned, should include a wide variety of appropriate interventions, should promote health and social well-being among individuals, families and communities, and should reduce the adverse consequences of drug abuse for the individual and for society as a whole. 6. The Action Plan focuses on the need to design demand reduction campaigns and programmes to meet the needs of the population in general, as well as those of specific population groups, taking into account differences in gender, culture and education and 20 This may include, but is not restricted to, the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, the Joint United Nations Programme on Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, the International Labour Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Health Organization, as well as international financial institutions such as the World Bank. 2!
