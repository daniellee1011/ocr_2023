Takes note of the report of the High Commissioner on the composition of the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner and the measures implemented by the Office, as described therein, although they have not improved the situation; 2. Welcomes the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (JIU/REP/2003/6), with its particular emphasis on recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, submitted pursuant to resolutions 2002/80 of 25 April 2002 and 2003/74 of 25 April 2003 of the Commission on Human Rights; 3. Recalls that the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to hold accountable the heads of the relevant departments for the human resources action plans and to ensure that they in turn take due account of equitable geographical representation when considering candidates on the lists endorsed by the central review bodies, as well as candidates on the rosters, and to report to the General Assembly annually on progress made by departments in the implementation of their respective human resources action plans; 4. Expresses its grave concern at the conclusion contained in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit that the unbalanced geographical distribution of staff is a serious, endemic problem in the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5. Regrets that, despite the repeated requests by the Commission to correct the unbalanced geographical distribution of the staff, the situation remains, that one region accounts for more than half of the posts of the Office of the High Commissioner and for more posts than the four remaining regional groups combined, and that there has been a bigger increase in the number of posts not subject to geographical distribution than for those subject to geographical distribution, which account for little more than one third of the total staff; 6. Recognizes that the establishment of the Advisory Panel on Personnel Issues is a reasonable initiative, but also that the current composition of the panel is very inequitable, with only one member of the six being from a developing country, and therefore requests that the High Commissioner review its composition and mandate with a view to reflecting a balanced geographical distribution in the membership of the Panel and ensuring that it contributes to the improvement of the composition of the staff of the Office in general; Takes note of the recommendation of the High Commissioner that the Office of Human Resources Management establish a human rights occupational group to attract to the area of human rights qualified junior professionals from non-represented and underrepresented countries, while stressing that it would be more effective for the Office of the High Commissioner to provide the Office of Human Resources Management with a list of countries unrepresented or underrepresented within the Office, and therefore requests that the Office of the High Commissioner compile annually such a list and that the Office of Human Resources Management take that list into consideration when organizing competitive examinations; 8. Welcomes the fact that the Office has instituted measures to apply the Organization’s principles of geographical distribution with particular regard to unrepresented and underrepresented developing countries when filling extrabudgetary posts and that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of staff not subject to geographical distribution from developing-country regional groups and from countries with economies in transition, and requests the High Commissioner to continue using the policy of new recruitment to correct the current imbalance in the composition of the staff of the Office; 9. Expresses its concern that half of the newly recruited staff for posts not subject to geographical distribution come from one region, which accounts for slightly more newly recruited staff than the four remaining regions combined, thereby keeping the existing gap almost intact; 10. Also expresses its concern about the widespread assignment of technical advisers (staff holding appointments under the 200 series of the Staff Rules of the United Nations) to carry out line functions, which should be performed by 100-series staff, and to supervise staff under the 100 series of the Staff Rules, a practice against established policies that should be 10. discontinued; 1. Stresses that the proposal of the Office of the High Commissioner to the Office of Human Resources Management to reduce the number of 200-series contracts of staff performing core functions by converting their 200-series contracts into 100-series contracts, limited to service with the Office of the High Commissioner, is against United Nations human resources policies, regulations and rules and, therefore, unacceptable; 11. 12. Requests the Office of the High Commissioner to observe fully United Nations human resources policies, regulations, rules and practices and, therefore, to align without further delay its human resources practices and procedures, in particular its recruitment and contractual policies, with Secretariat human resources policies, rules, regulations and practices and, furthermore, to check and align its post-classification criteria with those of the Secretariat before any post is advertised and to discontinue the practice of advertising extrabudgetary posts without first checking the classification criteria with the United Nations Office in Geneva; 12. 13. Reiterates the need for the High Commissioner to observe the provisions contained in section X, paragraph 3, of General Assembly resolution 55/258 of 14 June 2001 on human resources management, which reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to increase further his efforts to improve the composition of the Secretariat by ensuring a wide and equitable geographical distribution of staff in all departments; 13. 14. Considers that it is necessary to take urgent, concrete and immediate action to change the currently prevailing geographical distribution of staff of the Office in favour of a more equitable distribution of posts, in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter, particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including to senior posts; 14. 15. Requests once again the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure that particular attention is paid to recruiting personnel from non-represented and underrepresented Member States, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, for the existing vacancies and for additional posts in the Office of the High Commissioner to ensure an equitable geographical distribution and a better gender balance, giving particular priority in this regard to recruitment for high-level and Professional posts; 15. 16. Urges donors to make their voluntary contributions unearmarked, as much as possible, to enable the High Commissioner flexibility in the allocation of staff and resources between the different activities and projects; 16. 17. Requests once again the Secretary-General, in signing agreements with countries as a result of which Junior Professional Officers are provided to the Office of the High Commissioner, to urge those countries to ensure the allocation of additional financial resources to guarantee that personnel from developing countries are able to work as Junior Professional Officers, with a view to conforming with the principle of equitable geographical distribution; furthermore, a permanent mechanism must be established, by virtue of which every Junior Professional Officer from a donor country who joins the Office will be matched by another Junior Professional Officer from a developing country; 17. 18. Emphasizes the importance of openly advertising all posts, including ad hoc appointments for field operations, including the dissemination of detailed job descriptions among all States prior to the filling of those posts; 18. 19. Requests the High Commissioner to ensure that Junior Professional Officers are not given either sensitive political or core assignments where their impartiality may be questioned; 19. 20. Reiterates the standing rule that consultants shall not perform functions of staff members of the Organization nor have any representative or supervisory responsibility, and calls upon the High Commissioner to: 20. Refrain from using consultants to carry out functions assigned to established (a) posts; (b) Strictly observe the existing rules and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly in hiring consultants, in particular to ensure and certify that expertise is not available within the Organization before deciding to hire them; () Make greater efforts to ensure geographical balance among qualified consultants and individual contractors; 21. Reaffirms the importance of ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of human rights issues and requests the High Commissioner to continue to ensure that the fulfilment of his mandate and that of the Office is guided by these principles; 21. 22. Stresses that the staff of the Office of the High Commissioner need to maintain their neutrality and fully respect the independence of the work of all mechanisms of the Commission and the treaty bodies, while providing support to their functioning; 22. Also requests the High Commissioner: 23. (a) To prepare a comprehensive action plan aimed at reducing the current imbalance in the staff, indicating specific targets and deadlines to be achieved; (b) To avoid overlapping and duplication of functions and to work towards the goal of increased effectiveness and improved management, taking into account the relevant resolutions and decisions, including the request of the General Assembly for streamlined management, as well as the recommendations made in that regard, when proposing new structures, posts and reclassifications of posts, including those of senior management, with a view to ensuring optimal leadership and consistency of structures; () To submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of the present resolution to the Commission at its sixty-first session, which should include: The composition of the staff of the Office, organized by the five United Nations regional groups established by the General Assembly (African States, Asian States, Latin American and Caribbean States, Western European and Other States and Eastern European States) and reflecting, inter alia, grade, nationality and gender, including with regard to non-regular staff; @ The action plan, as well as the measures adopted to implement it, concrete achievements and their results; (i) The measures taken to implement other actions requested by the present resolution and their achievements; (iii) Any further recommendations to improve the current situation; (iv) Draws the attention of the General Assembly to the present resolution in the 24. context of the consideration of the agenda item on human resources management; 25. Invites the General Assembly and its appropriate subsidiary bodies, inter alia, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the Committee for Programme and Coordination and the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly, to give due consideration to the present resolution and to the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on the management review of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Right (JIU/REP/2003/6), in particular to any other organization, management, executive direction, structure, administrative, financial and more technical human resources management issues and recommendations contained therein and not addressed in this resolution; 25. 26. Requests the Joint Inspection Unit to assist the Commission on Human Rights to monitor systematically the implementation of the present resolution and to submit a follow-up comprehensive review of the implementation of the decisions of the Commission and other intergovernmental bodies of the Organization regarding the management, programmes and 26. administration of the Office of the High Commissioner, in particular, with regard to their impact on the recruitment policies and the composition of the staff, to the Commission at its sixty-third session and to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session, containing any concrete proposals for corrective action, if required, for the implementation of the relevant intergovernmental bodies’ resolutions, including the present resolution; Decides to consider this matter under the same agenda item at its 27. sixty-first session.

2004,Commonwealth Of Independent States,N/A,N/A,8 (b),"Nature, Timing and Sequencing of Post-2004 Meetings of the States Parties and Related Matters","1. On 13 February 2004, the First Preparatory Meeting considered, inter alia, the discussion paper prepared by Germany and Malaysia on “Nature, Timing and Sequencing of Post-2004 Meetings of the States Parties and Related Matters,” contained in document APLC/CONF/2004/PM.1/WP.2 dated 26 January 2004 (hereinafter referred to as “the Discussion Paper”). The Meeting expressed that the contents of this paper “would provide useful direction to the President-designate in his ongoing efforts to develop with the States Parties [...]",N/A,"2. During the consideration of the Discussion Paper, many States Parties as well as interested international and non-governmental organizations expressed clear views as to their preferences for one or several of the options developed in the annex to the Discussion Paper. However, it appeared from the deliberations that the model solutions presented in the paper could be further refined, differentiated, or reconceived. With the approval of the President- designate, Germany and Malaysia, therefore, in order to gather more detailed and additional views on the matter, developed a questionnaire including several options (1 —4), which was submitted to States Parties, interested international and non-governmental organisations.","3. In total 23 answers to this questionnaire were received (21 States Parties, 2 NGOs), which are indicative and helpful in identifying trends and opinions with regard to the decision to be taken at the Review Conference. 4. Evaluation of answers to the questionnaire, including the different options included in it, comes to the following results: General preferences are in favour of maintaining the organisational structure and nature of meetings, as developed in the years since the Convention entered into force. There seems to be no need for any basic changes. (1) Procedural Report of the First Preparatory Meeting, paragraph 15 (document APLC/CONF/2004/PM.1/2 dated 3 March 2004). GE.04-61928 Annual meetings: While there is comparatively less interest in Option 3, a large majority of answers (17 of 22) supports a leaner annual programme (Options 1, 2, 4), of Meetings of States Parties (MSP) and informal Meetings of Standing Committees (MSC) but opinions are divided or contradictory on how best to achieve this aim, be it through (i) Option 1 (respectively one MSP and one MSC per year). Arguments in favour of this option appear to be, that it maintains established meetings schedule until 2RC as important implementation deadlines are due in the interval; warrants important attention on Convention’s humanitarian objectives; is cost-effective; maintains of good balance between formal and informal meetings; represents a reasonable compromise between rationalizing the intersessional work programme and the necessity to reaffirm high political commitment, or (2) Option 2 (also holding two meetings per year, but only 2 MSPs in the run- up to the Second Review Conference, holding additional MSCs in the intervals), arguing that this option emphasises the informal mechanism; provides more opportunities for deliberations of experts; is effective in terms of cost, discussion, problem solving and time-saving; avoids the burden and the costs of the existing structure. (b) In addition, answers to the separate question about an adequate number of meetings (MSP and MSC) indicate a certain interest in increasing the number of MSCs, as compared to MSPs. (©) The matter will merit further discussion during the forthcoming Second Preparatory Meeting. Duration of meetings: There seems to be no significant interest to shorten the meetings as such; a rhythm of 4 — 5 days as the usual duration of formal (MSP) and informal (MSC) meetings, seems to be well established and acceptable for most. (iii) Venue of future meetings: Concrete answers to this question are scarce. There seems to be little objection to holding meetings — as until now — both in mine- affected States and in Geneva (iv) Regional Meetings: With regard to a possible introduction of informal regional meetings in addition to the Meetings of States Parties and the informal meetings of the Standing Committees, opinions are clearly divided among ""pros"" and ""cons"" and do not indicate any clear trend. Further discussion of this question seems to be necessary ™) Many answers are in favour of greater flexibility of the conference mechanisms, in accordance with practical needs and interests of consultation and cooperation, focussing primarily on the intersessional work programme, without modifying rules of procedure (vi) (vii) Thematic discussions receive support, in particular in the framework of MSCs (viii)) While most see the existing structures of formal MSPs and informal MSCs as allowing for an adequate participation of non-governmental organizations, a few answers still see room for improvement. Existing structures of and time allotted to the Standing Committees in the framework of meetings are generally considered as being adequate for serving the purposes of the Convention. The same applies to the existing sharing of responsibility between mine-affected and non-mine-affected States Parties in the Standing Committees. (ix) The existing structures of the Coordinating Committee and the Implementation Support Unit are equally considered by a clear majority of the answers as being adequate for serving the purposes of the Convention. ) Following the different answers, there is no clear picture on what kind of meetings — MSPs, MSCs, or Regional Meetings — may best serve as adequate fora (xi) to exchange information on victim assistance (2) or to positively influence the disposition to allocate resources for the purposes pursuant to Article 6 of the Convention (b) (xii) But, with regard to transparency, answers indicate very clearly that participants are of the opinion that both Meetings of the States Parties and the informal meetings of the Standing Committees serve adequately as means to exchange information pursuant to Article 7 of the Convention, and as means to highlight the importance of the Convention’s transparency reporting obligations. 5. Based on these results and taking into account additional comments by States Parties, interested international organisations and non-governmental organisations, the Second Preparatory Meeting may wish to consider the following proposal: Draft Decision of States Parties on the Nature, Timing and Sequencing of Post-2004 Meetings of the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention Convinced that both formal meetings of States Parties, as well as informal Meetings of Standing Committees, on a regular basis, and with the full and active participation of States Parties, interested International Organisations and of Non-Governmental Organisations, as well as States not parties that share our aims but have not yet joined our common effort, are indispensable and of the greatest value for the future functioning of the Convention and the realisation of its aims, Taking into account the considerable experience gained in the years since the entering into force of the Convention, including the existing organisational structure and characteristics of meetings with their focus on the Convention's core aims, partnership and cooperation, flexibility and informality, continuity, and effective preparations, Appreciating the work and structure of the Standing Committees, the Coordination Committee and the Implementation Support Unit as important elements for the implementation of the Convention, Recognizing the value of regional initiatives, including conferences and workshops that can help enhance efforts to implement the Convention and assist in preparing States Parties for Meetings of the States Parties and Meetings of the Standing Committees, Convinced that transparency is important to assuring confidence and that the exchange of information is central to the proper functioning of the Convention's cooperation mechanisms, States Parties decide to 1. hold — until the Second Review Conference — [one Meeting of the States Parties every year] [Meetings of the States Parties in the years 2006 and 2008] which will regularly take place in the second half of the year. 2. Convene, including in the year 2009, informal intersessional meetings of the Standing Committees at a time in the first half of each year, when the States Parties could take advantage of new information furnished through Article 7 reporting. [In the years 2005 and 2007, intersessional meetings will also be convened in the second half of the year.] 3. Duration of these meetings will normally be of up to 4, maximum 5 days. 4. The Second Review Conference will take place in the second half of the year 2009. 5. The Sixth Meeting of States Parties will take place in the second half of the year 200[6] in 6. [Meetings of the Standing Committees will take place XX-XX May/June 2006] 7. In keeping with the States Parties practice of being flexible and pragmatic in addressing changing circumstances, the States Parties may review decisions regarding their 2005 — 2009 programme of meetings at each Meeting of the States Parties prior to the Second Review Conference.",06/28/2004,2004_527276,Malaysia,N/A,yes

On 13 February 2004, the First Preparatory Meeting considered, inter alia, the discussion paper prepared by Germany and Malaysia on “Nature, Timing and Sequencing of Post-2004 Meetings of the States Parties and Related Matters,” contained in document APLC/CONF/2004/PM.1/WP.2 dated 26 January 2004 (hereinafter referred to as “the Discussion Paper”). The Meeting expressed that the contents of this paper “would provide useful direction to the President-designate in his ongoing efforts to develop with the States Parties [...]",N/A,"2. During the consideration of the Discussion Paper, many States Parties as well as interested international and non-governmental organizations expressed clear views as to their preferences for one or several of the options developed in the annex to the Discussion Paper. However, it appeared from the deliberations that the model solutions presented in the paper could be further refined, differentiated, or reconceived. With the approval of the President- designate, Germany and Malaysia, therefore, in order to gather more detailed and additional views on the matter, developed a questionnaire including several options (1 —4), which was submitted to States Parties, interested international and non-governmental organisations.","3. In total 23 answers to this questionnaire were received (21 States Parties, 2 NGOs), which are indicative and helpful in identifying trends and opinions with regard to the decision to be taken at the Review Conference. 4. Evaluation of answers to the questionnaire, including the different options included in it, comes to the following results: General preferences are in favour of maintaining the organisational structure and nature of meetings, as developed in the years since the Convention entered into force. There seems to be no need for any basic changes. (1) ' Procedural Report of the First Preparatory Meeting, paragraph 15 (document APLC/CONF/2004/PM.1/2 dated 3 March 2004). GE.04-63984 Annual meetings: While there is comparatively less interest in Option 3, a large majority of answers (17 of 22) supports a leaner annual programme (Options 1, 2, 4), of Meetings of States Parties (MSP) and informal Meetings of Standing Committees (MSC) but opinions are divided or contradictory on how best to achieve this aim, be it through (i) Option 1 (respectively one MSP and one MSC per year). Arguments in favour of this option appear to be, that it maintains established meetings schedule until 2RC as important implementation deadlines are due in the interval; warrants important attention on Convention’s humanitarian objectives; is cost-effective; maintains of good balance between formal and informal meetings; represents a reasonable compromise between rationalizing the intersessional work programme and the necessity to reaffirm high political commitment, or (a) Option 2 (also holding two meetings per year, but only 2 MSPs in the run- up to the Second Review Conference, holding additional MSCs in the intervals), arguing that this option emphasises the informal mechanism; provides more opportunities for deliberations of experts; is effective in terms of cost, discussion, problem solving and time-saving; avoids the burden and the costs of the existing structure. (b) In addition, answers to the separate question about an adequate number of meetings (MSP and MSC) indicate a certain interest in increasing the number of MSCs, as compared to MSPs. (©) The matter will merit further discussion during the forthcoming Second Preparatory Meeting. Duration of meetings: There seems to be no significant interest to shorten the meetings as such; a rhythm of 4 — 5 days as the usual duration of formal (MSP) and informal (MSC) meetings, seems to be well established and acceptable for most. (iii) Venue of future meetings: Concrete answers to this question are scarce. There seems to be little objection to holding meetings — as until now — both in mine- affected States and in Geneva (iv) Regional Meetings: With regard to a possible introduction of informal regional meetings in addition to the Meetings of States Parties and the informal meetings of the Standing Committees, opinions are clearly divided among ""pros"" and ""cons"" and do not indicate any clear trend. Further discussion of this question seems to be necessary V) Many answers are in favour of greater flexibility of the conference mechanisms, in accordance with practical needs and interests of consultation and cooperation, focussing primarily on the intersessional work programme, without modifying rules of procedure (vi) (vii) Thematic discussions receive support, in particular in the framework of MSCs (viii) While most see the existing structures of formal MSPs and informal MSCs as allowing for an adequate participation of non-governmental organizations, a few answers still see room for improvement. Existing structures of and time allotted to the Standing Committees in the framework of meetings are generally considered as being adequate for serving the purposes of the Convention. The same applies to the existing sharing of responsibility between mine-affected and non-mine-affected States Parties in the Standing Committees. (ix) The existing structures of the Coordinating Committee and the Implementation Support Unit are equally considered by a clear majority of the answers as being adequate for serving the purposes of the Convention. (x) Following the different answers, there is no clear picture on what kind of meetings — MSPs, MSCs, or Regional Meetings — may best serve as adequate fora (xi) to exchange information on victim assistance (a) or to positively influence the disposition to allocate resources for the purposes pursuant to Article 6 of the Convention (b) (xii) But, with regard to transparency, answers indicate very clearly that participants are of the opinion that both Meetings of the States Parties and the informal meetings of the Standing Committees serve adequately as means to exchange information pursuant to Article 7 of the Convention, and as means to highlight the importance of the Convention’s transparency reporting obligations. 5. Based on these results and taking into account additional comments by States Parties, interested international organisations and non-governmental organisations, the Second Preparatory Meeting may wish to consider the following proposal: Draft Decision of States Parties on the Nature, Timing and Sequencing of Post-2004 Meetings of the States Parties to the Ottawa Convention Convinced that both formal meetings of States Parties, as well as informal Meetings of Standing Committees, on a regular basis, and with the full and active participation of States Parties, interested International Organisations and of Non-Governmental Organisations, as well as States not parties that share our aims but have not yet joined our common effort, are indispensable and of the greatest value for the future functioning of the Convention and the realisation of its aims, Taking into account the considerable experience gained in the years since the entering into force of the Convention, including the existing organisational structure and characteristics of meetings with their focus on the Convention's core aims, partnership and cooperation, flexibility and informality, continuity, and effective preparations, Appreciating the work and structure of the Standing Committees, the Coordination Committee and the Implementation Support Unit as important elements for the implementation of the Convention, Recognizing the value of regional initiatives, including conferences and workshops that can help enhance efforts to implement the Convention and assist in preparing States Parties for Meetings of the States Parties and Meetings of the Standing Committees, Convinced that transparency is important to assuring confidence and that the exchange of information is central to the proper functioning of the Convention's cooperation mechanisms, States Parties decide to 1. hold — until the Second Review Conference — [one Meeting of the States Parties every year] [Meetings of the States Parties in the years 2006 and 2008] which will regularly take place in the second half of the year. 2. Convene, including in the year 2009, informal intersessional meetings of the Standing Committees at a time in the first half of each year, when the States Parties could take advantage of new information furnished through Article 7 reporting. [In the years 2005 and 2007, intersessional meetings will also be convened in the second half of the year.] 3. Duration of these meetings will normally be of up to 4, maximum 5 days. 4. The Second Review Conference will take place in the second half of the year 2009. 5. The Sixth Meeting of States Parties will take place in the second half of the year 200[6] in 6. [Meetings of the Standing Committees will take place XX-XX May/June 2006] 7. In keeping with the States Parties practice of being flexible and pragmatic in addressing changing circumstances, the States Parties may review decisions regarding their 2005 — 2009 programme of meetings at each Meeting of the States Parties prior to the Second Review Conference.",11/15/2004,2004_554264,Malaysia,N/A,yes
