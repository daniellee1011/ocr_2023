Recognizes that progress has been made, yet is deeply concerned that many persons with disabilities and women in vulnerable situations in all regions continue to face multiple and intersecting forms of inequality and discrimination, which represent significant obstacles in exercising their right to work on an equal basis with others, and that they are frequently subject to less favourable conditions of pay, precarious, often informal work conditions and poor career prospects in a context of environmental, social and economic barriers in their access to work and within work, and in education and training, which results on many occasions in neglect of their potential and restrictions on opportunities to earn a living through their capabilities; 12. Underscores the responsibility of the State to prevent the engagement of children in the worst forms of child labour and to protect them from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with their education or to be harmful to their health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development; 13. | Expresses concern that, according to the report of the International Labour Organization World Employment Social Outlook: Trends 2017, global unemployment is expected to rise in 2017 compared with 2016 by 3.4 million, of which a sizeable proportion are young people, and that the international economic and financial crisis has had a severe impact in that regard, and notes with concern that the global level of women’s participation in the labour force is 27 per cent lower than that of men; 14. Notes with concern that, according to the report of the International Labour Organization Women at Work: Trends 2016, women’s labour force participation in 2015 is estimated to be 49.6 per cent globally compared with 76.1 per cent for men, and that women workers are disproportionately represented in the informal economy as well as non- standard forms of employment, such as part-time and temporary contracts or self- employment, which can on many occasions compromise their job security, working conditions and social protection; and that in developing countries, the share of women in underemployment exceeds that of men; 15. Expresses deep concern that inequalities are widening and there are not enough jobs, including quality jobs, to keep up with a growing labour force and, bearing in mind the fundamental importance of equal opportunities, education and vocational training in the context of realizing the right to work, emphasizes that full and productive employment and decent work for young people play an important role in their empowerment and can contribute to, inter alia, the prevention of extremism, terrorism and social, economic and political instability; A/HRC/34/L.22 16. Stresses that technical and vocational education, including in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and lifelong learning opportunities and guidance for all, including women with disabilities, are necessary for the realization of the right to work; 17. Welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and emphasizes that there are targets therein to “by 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value” (target 8.5 of the Sustainable Development Goals) and to “recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family, as nationally appropriate” (target 5.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals), strengthening the efforts towards gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, and calls for the implementation of its relevant goals and targets; 18. Stresses that the Sustainable Development Goals promote inclusive and sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity and technological innovation, and encourage entrepreneurship and job creation, which can be effective measures to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, forced labour, contemporary forms of slavery and human trafficking and to ensure that no one is left behind, bearing these targets in mind, the goal is to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men by 2030; 19. Recognizes that employment should be a central objective of economic and social policies at the national, regional and international levels for the sustainable eradication of poverty and for providing an adequate standard of living, and emphasizes in that regard the importance of relevant social protection measures, including social protection floors; 20. Recognizes the fundamental importance of international cooperation, including through technical cooperation, capacity-building and exchange of relevant lessons learned and good practices, in advancing efforts towards the full realization of the right to work through inclusive, sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all; 21. Calls upon States to put in place comprehensive policies and to take the legislative and administrative measures necessary for the full realization of the right to work for all, including women, by, inter alia, considering to undertake policy commitments and measures to obtain full and productive employment and decent work for all, including through the establishment, where appropriate, of institutions for that purpose and by further strengthening tools, such as job services and social dialogue mechanisms, while paying continuous attention to professional and technical training and initiatives to foster small and medium-sized enterprises, cooperatives and start-ups, especially those that are owned by women, as well as considering investing in infrastructure, services and social protection systems to allow for equitable sharing of care responsibilities between men and women; 22. Highlights the vital role of the private sector in generating new investments, job opportunities and financing for development and in advancing efforts towards the full realization of the right to work and the promotion of inclusive, sustained economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all, noting the multi-year strategy of the United Nations Global Compact to drive business awareness and action in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, and recalling the need to promote the implementation of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as well as the Women’s Empowerment Principles established by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and the Global Compact; A/HRC/34/L.22 23. Recognizes the important contribution of workers’ and employers’ organizations in the area of full and productive employment and decent work for all, and the importance of promoting women’s equitable representation, participation and leadership in such organizations; 24. | Underscores that there is an urgent need to create an environment at the national and international levels that is conducive to the attainment of full and productive employment and decent work for all as a foundation for sustainable development and that an environment that supports investment, growth and entrepreneurship is essential to the creation of new job opportunities for women and men, and reaffirms that opportunities for men and women to obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity are essential to ensure the eradication of hunger and poverty, the realization of equality between women and men, the improvement of economic and social well-being for all, the achievement of sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth and sustainable development of all nations and a fully inclusive and equitable globalization; 25. Encourages States to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the field of employment in order to ensure, on the basis of the equality of men and women, the same rights; 26. Calls upon States to implement effective and targeted measures to ensure women’s equal access to decent work and full and productive employment, including through investments in care infrastructure, policies and employment services that address specific challenges faced by women and policies that aim at removing conditions disadvantageous to women during the recruitment process, and to monitor the implementation of the regulatory measures aimed at protecting women against unfair treatment or arbitrary dismissals on account of sex, pregnancy or childbirth and assessing their effectiveness, while providing access to effective remedies; 27. Recognizes the importance of addressing the root causes that contribute to lesser participation of women in entrepreneurial activities and business ownership, and that financial inclusion is critical for promoting women’s access to means of production, including through access to credit and financial services; 28. Calls upon States to continue their efforts to prevent and combat all forms of discrimination and violence, including sexual harassment at the workplace, including by adopting and implementing laws and policies and through training, awareness-raising and support for women’s access to justice with respect to violence and sexual harassment, bearing in mind that these continue to be among the factors that have an adverse impact on the realization of the right to work for women; 29. Encourages States to take all appropriate measures to prohibit discrimination in all matters concerning access to employment and job opportunities, including in relation to equal conditions of pay, hiring and career advancement, and to pay particular attention to women facing multiple and intersecting forms of inequality and discrimination and women in vulnerable situations, including women with disabilities whose labour rights are often violated; 30. Acknowledges that the promotion of greater involvement by women in policymaking, law-making processes and workers’ and employers’ organizations is called for; 31. Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare an analytical report, in consultation with States, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, particularly the International Labour Organization, and the treaty bodies, special procedures, civil society, national human rights institutions and other stakeholders, on the relationship between the realization of the right to work and the implementation of A/HRC/34/L.22 relevant targets in the Sustainable Development Goals, in accordance with States’ respective obligations under international human rights law, to indicate the major challenges and best practices in that regard and to submit the report to the Human Rights Council prior to its thirty-seventh session; 32.

the enjoyment of other rights and the free development of an individual’s personality and identity, and an individual’s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life, and noting with concern that violations or abuses of the right to privacy might affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, Noting with concern that automatic processing of personal data for individual profiling may lead to discrimination or decisions that otherwise have the potential to affect the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, and recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse these practices on the basis of international human rights law, Expressing concern that individuals often do not provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the re-use, sale or multiple re-sales of their personal data, as the collecting, processing and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, has increased significantly in the digital age, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken extraterritorially or on a mass scale, Emphasizing also that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect personal data and when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including business enterprises, Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights as set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, and that the obligation and the primary responsibility to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms lie with the State, Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, A/HRC/34/L.7/Rev.1 Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law, Emphasizing that, in the digital age, technical solutions to secure and to protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption and anonymity, can be important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy, to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Emphasizing also that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment is important to the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to privacy, Noting that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age may affect all individuals, including with particular effects on women, as well as children and persons in vulnerable situations, or marginalized groups, Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities, Noting that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, 1.

right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use information and communications technology and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, business enterprises and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern, Noting also that, while metadata may provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information that can be no less sensitive than the actual content of communications and can give an insight into an individual’s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, Noting with concern that automatic processing of personal data for individual profiling may lead to discrimination or decisions that otherwise have the potential to affect the enjoyment of human rights, including economic, social and cultural rights, and recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse these practices on the basis of international

processing and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, has increased significantly in the digital age, Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, including when undertaken extraterritorially, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken on a mass scale, Emphasizing also that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they

carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive

protect the confidentiality of digital communications, including measures for encryption and anonymity, can be important to ensure the enjoyment of human rights, in particular the rights to privacy,

stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, owing to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to its prevention and removal are necessary, including identification of such sources and environmentally sound techniques for its removal, Recognizing also that the majority of marine debris, including plastics and microplastics, entering the seas and oceans is considered to originate from land- based sources, Recognizing further that abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear, including ghost fishing gear, is an increasingly pervasive and destructive form of marine debris causing adverse impacts on fish stocks, marine life and the marine environment and that urgent preventative action is needed, such as marking of fishing gear as proposed by the Committee on Fisheries, as well as removal action, 7 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, document C 2009/REP and Corr.1-3, appendix E. 5/39 Reaffirming the importance of sustainable aquaculture to food security,

implementation of relevant paragraphs of previous resolutions, representing a threat to vulnerable marine ecosystems, Calling attention to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities whose livelihoods, economic development and food security are heavily dependent on sustainable fisheries and will suffer disproportionately if sustainable fisheries are negatively affected, Calling attention also to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries- and aquaculture-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to exercise their rights in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources and fulfil their obligations under international instruments, Recognizing the need to adopt, implement and enforce appropriate measures to minimize waste, by-catch and discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear and other factors that adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks and ecosystems and, consequently, can also have harmful effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities, Recognizing also the need to adopt and implement appropriate measures, consistent with the best available scientific information, to minimize by-catch of non-targeted species and juveniles through the effective management of fishing methods, including the use and design of fish aggregating devices, in order to mitigate adverse effects on fish stocks and ecosystems, Recognizing further the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into fisheries conservation and management and, more generally, the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, and noting in this regard the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem, * the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
