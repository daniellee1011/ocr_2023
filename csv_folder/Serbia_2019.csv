sexual harassment, threats and intimidation, inequality and gender-based stereotypes, to enable women to enter and remain in journalism on terms of equality and non-discrimination while ensuring their greatest possible safety, and to ensure that the experiences and concerns of women journalists are effectively addressed and gender stereotypes in the media are adequately tackled, Acknowledging the particular risks with regard to the safety of journalists in the digital age, including the particular vulnerability of journalists to becoming targets of unlawful or arbitrary surveillance or

Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers and legal guardians, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to their family, benefiting the child directly; 31.

(b) Adopting and enforcing laws and improving the implementation of policies and programmes, budget allocation and human resources to support children, particularly children with disabilities, and children living in disadvantaged, stigmatized and marginalized families, to address the root causes of unnecessary family separation and ensure that they are cared for effectively by their own families and communities; 9/15 (c) Taking all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child; (d) Recognizing the right of a child who has been placed by competent authorities for the purposes of care, protection or treatment of his or her physical or mental health, to a periodic review of the treatment provided to the child and all other circumstances relevant to his or her placement; (e) Ensuring that removal of children from the care of their family should be seen as a measure of last resort and should, whenever possible, be temporary and removal decisions should be regularly reviewed and the child’s return to parental care, once the causes of removal have been resolved or have disappeared, should have the best interests of the child as a primary consideration and be based on comprehensive assessment; (f) Developing and strengthening inclusive and responsive family-oriented policies and programmes for poverty reduction, also designed to promote and strengthen parents’ ability to care for their children, and to confront family poverty and social exclusion, recognizing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on inclusive and quality education and lifelong learning for all, including initiatives to promote involved and positive parenting, health and well-being for all at all ages, equal access to economic resources, full and productive employment, decent work, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion and promoting and protecting the human rights of all family members; (g) Providing gender-sensitive and child-sensitive social protection systems, which are key to ensuring poverty reduction, including, as appropriate, targeted cash transfers for families in vulnerable situations, as can be the case of families headed by a single parent, in particular those headed by women or by children, and which are most effective in reducing poverty when accompanied by other measures, such as providing access to basic services, high-quality education, affordable quality childcare services and health-care services;

gender equality for sustainable development so that no one is left behind, including by ensuring public access to information and protecting fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements, and therefore recognizing the important contribution of the promotion and protection of the safety of journalists in this regard, Mindful that the right to freedom of opinion and expression is a human right guaranteed to all, in accordance with article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that it constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and development, Acknowledging that journalism is

the credibility of journalism, in particular the challenges of maintaining media professionalism in an environment where new forms of media are constantly evolving and where targeted disinformation

threats, harassment and violence, which often deters journalists from continuing their work or encourages self-censorship, consequently depriving society of important information, Noting the good

the protection of journalists, Urging States to do their utmost to prevent violence, intimidation, threats and attacks against journalists and media workers, including by supporting capacity-

platforms and ongoing debates, and expressing serious concern that attacks against journalists and media workers increase during election periods, Alarmed at instances in which political leaders,

status as civilians, Recognizing the important role that national human rights institutions, where they exist, can play in promoting and protecting human rights, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and in addressing human rights violations and abuses against journalists through monitoring, educating and awareness-raising activities, as well as through the examination of

posed by non-State actors, including terrorist groups and criminal organizations, Deeply concerned by the specific risks faced by women journalists in relation to their work, in non-conflict as well

harassment, threats and intimidation, as well as inequality and gender-based stereotypes, to enable women to enter and remain in journalism on terms of equality and non-discrimination while ensuring their greatest possible safety, and to ensure that the experiences and concerns of women journalists are effectively addressed and gender stereotypes in the media are adequately tackled, Acknowledging the particular risks with regard to the safety of journalists in the digital age, including the particular vulnerability of journalists to becoming targets of 4/7 unlawful or arbitrary surveillance or interception of communications, in violation of their rights to privacy and to freedom of expression, Recognizing that national legal frameworks consistent with States’ international human rights
