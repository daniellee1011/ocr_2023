Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, at its [...] session, on the implementation of the present resolution. Annex United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems A. Introduction 1. Legal aid is an essential element of a fair, humane and efficient criminal justice system that is based on the rule of law. Legal aid is a foundation for the enjoyment of other rights, including the right to a fair trial, as defined in article 11, paragraph 1, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a precondition to V.12-52078 exercising such rights and an important safeguard that ensures fundamental fairness and public trust in the criminal justice process. 2. Furthermore, article 14, paragraph 3(d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that everyone should be entitled, among other rights, “to be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it”. 3. A functioning legal aid system, as part of a functioning criminal justice system, may reduce the length of time suspects are held in police stations and detention centres, in addition to reducing the prison population, wrongful convictions, prison overcrowding and congestion in the courts, and reducing reoffending and revictimization. It may also protect and safeguard the rights of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process. Legal aid can be utilized to contribute to the prevention of crime by increasing awareness of the law. 4. Legal aid plays an important role in facilitating diversion and the use of community-based sanctions and measures, including non-custodial measures; promoting greater community involvement in the criminal justice system; reducing the unnecessary use of detention and imprisonment; rationalizing criminal justice policies; and ensuring efficient use of State resources. 5. Regrettably, many countries still lack the necessary resources and capacity to provide legal aid for suspects, those charged with a criminal offence, prisoners, victims and witnesses. 6. The United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, which are drawn from international standards and recognized good practices, aim to provide guidance to States on the fundamental principles on which a legal aid system in criminal justice should be based and to outline the specific elements required for an effective and sustainable national legal aid system, in order to strengthen access to legal aid pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 2007/24, entitled “International cooperation for the improvement of access to legal aid in criminal justice systems, particularly in Africa”. 7. In line with the Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice System in Africa and the Lilongwe Plan of Action for the implementation of the Declaration, the Principles and Guidelines follow a broad concept of legal aid. 8. For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the term “legal aid” includes legal advice, assistance and representation for persons detained, arrested or imprisoned, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence and for victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process that is provided at no cost for those without sufficient means or when the interests of justice so require. Furthermore, “legal aid” is intended to include the concepts of legal education, access to legal information and other services provided for persons through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and restorative justice processes. 9. For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the individual who provides legal aid is herein referred to as the “legal aid provider”, and the organizations V.12-52078 that provide legal aid are referred to as the “legal aid service providers”. The first providers of legal aid are lawyers, but the Principles and Guidelines also suggest that States involve a wide range of stakeholders as legal aid service providers in the form of non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, religious and non-religious charitable organizations, professional bodies and associations and academia. Provision of legal aid to foreign nationals should conform to the requirements of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other applicable bilateral treaties. 10. It should be noted that States employ different models for the provision of legal aid. These may involve public defenders, private lawyers, contract lawyers, pro bono schemes, bar associations, paralegals and others. The Principles and Guidelines do not endorse any specific model but encourage States to guarantee the basic right to legal aid of persons detained, arrested@ or imprisoned, suspected? or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence, while expanding legal aid to include others who come into contact with the criminal justice system and diversifying legal aid delivery schemes. 11. The Principles and Guidelines are based on the recognition that States should, where appropriate, undertake a series of measures that, even if not strictly related to legal aid, can maximize the positive impact that the establishment and/or reinforcement of a properly working legal aid system may have on a properly functioning criminal justice system and on access to justice. 12. Recognizing that certain groups are entitled to additional protection or are more vulnerable when involved with the criminal justice system, the Principles and Guidelines also provide specific provisions for women, children and groups with special needs. 13. The Principles and Guidelines are primarily concerned with the right to legal aid, as distinct from the right to legal assistance as recognized in international law. Nothing in these Principles and Guidelines should be interpreted as providing a lesser degree of protection than that provided under existing national laws and regulations and international and regional human rights conventions or covenants applicable to the administration of justice, including, but not limited to, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. However, this should not be interpreted as meaning that States are bound by international and regional instruments that they have not ratified or acceded to. a The term “arrest”, “detained person” and “imprisoned person” are understood as defined in the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (General Assembly resolution 43/173, annex). » The right to legal aid of suspects arises before questioning, when they become aware that they are the subject of investigation, and when they are under threat of abuse and intimidation, e.g. in custodial settings. V.12-52078 B. Principles Principle 1. Right to legal aid 14. Recognizing that legal aid is a fundamental human right and an essential element of a functioning criminal justice system that is based on the rule of law, a foundation for the enjoyment of other rights, including the right to a fair trial, and an important safeguard that ensures fundamental fairness and public trust in the criminal justice process,* States should guarantee the right to legal aid in their national legal systems at the highest possible level, including, where applicable, in the constitution. Principle 2. Responsibilities of the State 15. States should consider the provision of legal aid as their duty and responsibility. To that end, they should consider, where appropriate, enacting specific legislation and regulations and ensure that a comprehensive legal aid system is in place that is accessible, effective, sustainable and credible. States should allocate the necessary human and financial resources to the legal aid system. 16. The State should not interfere with the organization of the defence of the beneficiary of legal aid or with the independence of his or her legal aid provider. 17. States should enhance knowledge of the people about their rights and obligations under law through appropriate means, in order to prevent criminal conduct and victimization. 18. States should endeavour to enhance the knowledge of their communities about their justice system and its functions, the ways to file complaints before the courts and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. 19. States should consider adopting appropriate measures for informing their community about acts criminalized under the law. The provision of such information for those travelling to other jurisdictions, where crimes are categorized and prosecuted differently, is essential for crime prevention. Principle 3. Legal aid for persons suspected of or charged with a criminal offence 20. States should ensure that anyone who is arrested, detained, suspected of or charged with a criminal offence punishable by a term of imprisonment or the death penalty is entitled to legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process. 21. Legal aid should also be provided, regardless of the person’s means, if the interests of justice so require, for example, given the urgency or complexity of the case or the severity of the potential penalty. 22. Children should have access to legal aid under the same conditions or more lenient conditions as adults. ¢ The term “justice process” is understood as defined in the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/20, annex). For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the term shall also encompass extradition, transfer of prisoners and mutual legal assistance proceedings. V.12-52078 23. It is the responsibility of police, prosecutors and judges to ensure that those who appear before them who cannot afford a lawyer and/or who are vulnerable are provided access to legal aid. Principle 4. Legal aid for victims of crime 24. Without prejudice to or inconsistency with the rights of the accused, States, should, where appropriate, provide legal aid to victims of crime. Principle 5. Legal aid for witnesses 25. Without prejudice to or inconsistency with the rights of the accused, States should, where appropriate, provide legal aid to witnesses of crime. Principle 6. Non-discrimination 26. States should ensure the provision of legal aid to all persons regardless of age, race, colour, gender, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin or property, citizenship or domicile, birth, education or social status or other status. Principle 7. Prompt and effective provision of legal aid 27. States should ensure that effective legal aid is provided promptly at all stages of the criminal justice process. 28. Effective legal aid includes, but is not limited to, unhindered access to legal aid providers for detained persons, confidentiality of communications, access to case files and adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence. Principle 8. Right to be informed 29. States should ensure that, prior to any questioning and at the time of deprivation of liberty, persons are informed of their right to legal aid and other procedural safeguards as well as of the potential consequences of voluntarily waiving those rights. 30. States should ensure that information on rights during the criminal justice process and on legal aid services is made freely available and is accessible to the public. Principle 9. Remedies and safeguards 31. States should establish effective remedies and safeguards that apply if access to legal aid is undermined, delayed or denied or if persons have not been adequately informed of their right to legal aid. Principle 10. Equity in access to legal aid 32. Special measures should be taken to ensure meaningful access to legal aid for women, children and groups with special needs, including, but not limited to, the elderly, minorities, persons with disabilities, persons with mental illnesses, persons living with HIV and other serious contagious diseases, drug users, indigenous and aboriginal people, stateless persons, asylum-seekers, foreign citizens, migrants and V.12-52078 migrant workers, refugees and internally displaced persons. Such measures should address the special needs of these groups, including gender-sensitive and age-appropriate measures. 33. States should also ensure that legal aid is provided to persons living in rural, remote and economically and socially disadvantaged areas and to persons who are members of economically and socially disadvantaged groups. Principle 11. Legal aid in the best interests of the child 34. In all legal aid decisions affecting children,‘ the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration. 35. Legal aid provided to children should be prioritized, in the best interests of the child, and be accessible, age-appropriate, multidisciplinary, effective and responsive to the specific legal and social needs of children. Principle 12. Independence and protection of legal aid providers 36. States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to carry out their work effectively, freely and independently. In particular, States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; are able to travel, to consult and meet with their clients freely and in full confidentiality both within their own country and abroad, and to freely access prosecution and other relevant files; and do not suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics. Principle 13. Competence and accountability of legal aid providers 37. States should put in place mechanisms to ensure that all legal aid providers possess education, training, skills and experience that are commensurate with the nature of their work, including the gravity of the offences dealt with, and the rights and needs of women, children and groups with special needs. 38. Disciplinary complaints against legal aid providers should be promptly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with professional codes of ethics before an impartial body and subject to judicial review. Principle 14. Partnerships 39. States should recognize and encourage the contribution of lawyers’ associations, universities, civil society and other groups and institutions in providing legal aid. 40. Where appropriate, public-private and other forms of partnerships should be established to extend the reach of legal aid. 4 “Child” shall mean any person under 18 years of age, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

States should, where appropriate, also take measures: (a) To encourage and support the establishment of legal aid clinics in law departments within universities to promote clinical and public interest law programmes among faculty members and the student body, including in the accredited curriculum of universities; (b) To encourage and provide incentives to law students to participate, under proper supervision and in accordance with national law or practice, in a legal aid clinic or other legal aid community scheme, as part of their academic curriculum or professional development; (c) To develop, where they do not already exist, student practice rules that allow students to practice in the courts under the supervision of qualified lawyers or 20 faculty staff, provided such rules are developed in consultation with and accepted by the competent courts or bodies that regulate the practice of law before the courts; (d) In jurisdictions requiring law students to undertake legal internships, develop rules for them to be allowed to practice in the courts under the supervision of qualified lawyers. Guideline 17. Research and data 73. States should ensure that mechanisms to track, monitor and evaluate legal aid are established and should continually strive to improve the provision of legal aid. 74. For this purpose, States could introduce measures: (a) To conduct regular research and data collection disaggregated by gender, age, socio-economic status and geographical distribution of legal aid recipients and to publish the findings of such research; (b) To share good practices in the provision of legal aid; (c) To monitor the efficient and effective delivery of legal aid in accordance with international human rights standards; (d) To provide cross-cultural, culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive and age-appropriate training to legal aid providers; (e) To improve communication, coordination and cooperation between all justice agencies, especially at the local level, to identify local problems and to agree on solutions to improve the provision of legal aid. Guideline 18. Technical assistance 75. Technical assistance based on needs and priorities identified by requesting States should be provided by relevant intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations, bilateral donors and competent non-governmental organizations, as well as by States in the framework of bilateral and multilateral cooperation, with a view to building and enhancing the national capacities and institutions for the development and implementation of legal aid systems and criminal justice reforms, where appropriate. 21",03/27/2012,2012_728976,Georgia,"* E/CN.15/2012/1. !

V.12-52823 Annex United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems A. Introduction 1. Legal aid is an essential element of a fair, humane and efficient criminal justice system that is based on the rule of law. Legal aid is a foundation for the enjoyment of other rights, including the right to a fair trial, as defined in article 11, paragraph 1, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a precondition to exercising such rights and an important safeguard that ensures fundamental fairness and public trust in the criminal justice process. 2. Furthermore, article 14, paragraph 3(d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that everyone should be entitled, among other rights, “to be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him in any case where the interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it”. 3. A functioning legal aid system, as part of a functioning criminal justice system, may reduce the length of time suspects are held in police stations and detention centres, in addition to reducing the prison population, wrongful convictions, prison overcrowding and congestion in the courts, and reducing reoffending and revictimization. It may also protect and safeguard the rights of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process. Legal aid can be utilized to contribute to the prevention of crime by increasing awareness of the law. 4. Legal aid plays an important role in facilitating diversion and the use of community-based sanctions and measures, including non-custodial measures; promoting greater community involvement in the criminal justice system; reducing the unnecessary use of detention and imprisonment; rationalizing criminal justice policies; and ensuring efficient use of State resources. 5. Regrettably, many countries still lack the necessary resources and capacity to provide legal aid for suspects, those charged with a criminal offence, prisoners, victims and witnesses. 6. The United Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, which are drawn from international standards and recognized good practices, aim to provide guidance to States on the fundamental principles on which a legal aid system in criminal justice should be based and to outline the specific elements required for an effective and sustainable national legal aid system, in order to strengthen access to legal aid pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 2007/24, entitled “International cooperation for the improvement of access to legal aid in criminal justice systems, particularly in Africa”. V.12-52823 7. In line with the Lilongwe Declaration on Accessing Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice System in Africa and the Lilongwe Plan of Action for the implementation of the Declaration, the Principles and Guidelines follow a broad concept of legal aid. 8. For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the term “legal aid” includes legal advice, assistance and representation for persons detained, arrested or imprisoned, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence and for victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process that is provided at no cost for those without sufficient means or when the interests of justice so require. Furthermore, “legal aid” is intended to include the concepts of legal education, access to legal information and other services provided for persons through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and restorative justice processes. 9. For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the individual who provides legal aid is herein referred to as the “legal aid provider”, and the organizations that provide legal aid are referred to as the “legal aid service providers”. The first providers of legal aid are lawyers, but the Principles and Guidelines also suggest that States involve a wide range of stakeholders as legal aid service providers in the form of non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, religious and non-religious charitable organizations, professional bodies and associations and academia. Provision of legal aid to foreign nationals should conform to the requirements of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and other applicable bilateral treaties. 10. It should be noted that States employ different models for the provision of legal aid. These may involve public defenders, private lawyers, contract lawyers, pro bono schemes, bar associations, paralegals and others. The Principles and Guidelines do not endorse any specific model but encourage States to guarantee the basic right to legal aid of persons detained, arrested@ or imprisoned, suspected® or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence, while expanding legal aid to include others who come into contact with the criminal justice system and diversifying legal aid delivery schemes. 11. The Principles and Guidelines are based on the recognition that States should, where appropriate, undertake a series of measures that, even if not strictly related to legal aid, can maximize the positive impact that the establishment and/or reinforcement of a properly working legal aid system may have on a properly functioning criminal justice system and on access to justice. 12. Recognizing that certain groups are entitled to additional protection or are more vulnerable when involved with the criminal justice system, the Principles and Guidelines also provide specific provisions for women, children and groups with special needs. 13. The Principles and Guidelines are primarily concerned with the right to legal aid, as distinct from the right to legal assistance as recognized in international law. a The term “arrest”, “detained person” and “imprisoned person” are understood as defined in the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (General Assembly resolution 43/173, annex). b The right to legal aid of suspects arises before questioning, when they become aware that they are the subject of investigation, and when they are under threat of abuse and intimidation, e.g. in custodial settings. V.12-52823 Nothing in these Principles and Guidelines should be interpreted as providing a lesser degree of protection than that provided under existing national laws and regulations and international and regional human rights conventions or covenants applicable to the administration of justice, including, but not limited to, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. However, this should not be interpreted as meaning that States are bound by international and regional instruments that they have not ratified or acceded to. B. Principles Principle 1. Right to legal aid 14. Recognizing that legal aid is an essential element of a functioning criminal justice system that is based on the rule of law, a foundation for the enjoyment of other rights, including the right to a fair trial, and an important safeguard that ensures fundamental fairness and public trust in the criminal justice process,° States should guarantee the right to legal aid in their national legal systems at the highest possible level, including, where applicable, in the constitution. Principle 2. Responsibilities of the State 15. States should consider the provision of legal aid as their duty and responsibility. To that end, they should consider, where appropriate, enacting specific legislation and regulations and ensure that a comprehensive legal aid system is in place that is accessible, effective, sustainable and credible. States should allocate the necessary human and financial resources to the legal aid system. 16. The State should not interfere with the organization of the defence of the beneficiary of legal aid or with the independence of his or her legal aid provider. 17. States should enhance knowledge of the people about their rights and obligations under law through appropriate means, in order to prevent criminal conduct and victimization. 18. States should endeavour to enhance the knowledge of their communities about their justice system and its functions, the ways to file complaints before the courts and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. 19. States should consider adopting appropriate measures for informing their community about acts criminalized under the law. The provision of such information for those travelling to other jurisdictions, where crimes are categorized and prosecuted differently, is essential for crime prevention. ¢ The term “justice process” is understood as defined in the Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime (Economic and Social Council resolution 2005/20, annex). For the purpose of the Principles and Guidelines, the term shall also encompass extradition, transfer of prisoners and mutual legal assistance proceedings. V.12-52823 Principle 3. Legal aid for persons suspected of or charged with a criminal offence 20. States should ensure that anyone who is arrested, detained, suspected of or charged with a criminal offence punishable by a term of imprisonment or the death penalty is entitled to legal aid at all stages of the criminal justice process. 21. Legal aid should also be provided, regardless of the person’s means, if the interests of justice so require, for example, given the urgency or complexity of the case or the severity of the potential penalty. 22. Children should have access to legal aid under the same conditions or more lenient conditions as adults. 23. It is the responsibility of police, prosecutors and judges to ensure that those who appear before them who cannot afford a lawyer and/or who are vulnerable are provided access to legal aid. Principle 4. Legal aid for victims of crime 24. Without prejudice to or inconsistency with the rights of the accused, States should, where appropriate, provide legal aid to victims of crime. Principle 5. Legal aid for witnesses 25. Without prejudice to or inconsistency with the rights of the accused, States should, where appropriate, provide legal aid to witnesses of crime. Principle 6. Non-discrimination 26. States should ensure the provision of legal aid to all persons regardless of age, race, colour, gender, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, national or social origin or property, citizenship or domicile, birth, education or social status or other status. Principle 7. Prompt and effective provision of legal aid 27. States should ensure that effective legal aid is provided promptly at all stages of the criminal justice process. 28. Effective legal aid includes, but is not limited to, unhindered access to legal aid providers for detained persons, confidentiality of communications, access to case files and adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence. Principle 8. Right to be informed 29. States should ensure that, prior to any questioning and at the time of deprivation of liberty, persons are informed of their right to legal aid and other procedural safeguards as well as of the potential consequences of voluntarily waiving those rights. 30. States should ensure that information on rights during the criminal justice process and on legal aid services is made freely available and is accessible to the public. V.12-52823 Principle 9. Remedies and safeguards 31. States should establish effective remedies and safeguards that apply if access to legal aid is undermined, delayed or denied or if persons have not been adequately informed of their right to legal aid. Principle 10. Equity in access to legal aid 32. Special measures should be taken to ensure meaningful access to legal aid for women, children and groups with special needs, including, but not limited to, the elderly, minorities, persons with disabilities, persons with mental illnesses, persons living with HIV and other serious contagious diseases, drug users, indigenous and aboriginal people, stateless persons, asylum-seekers, foreign citizens, migrants and migrant workers, refugees and internally displaced persons. Such measures should address the special needs of these groups, including gender-sensitive and age-appropriate measures. 33. States should also ensure that legal aid is provided to persons living in rural, remote and economically and socially disadvantaged areas and to persons who are members of economically and socially disadvantaged groups. Principle 11. Legal aid in the best interests of the child 34. In all legal aid decisions affecting children,‘ the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration. 35. Legal aid provided to children should be prioritized, in the best interests of the child, and be accessible, age-appropriate, multidisciplinary, effective and responsive to the specific legal and social needs of children. Principle 12. Independence and protection of legal aid providers 36. States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to carry out their work effectively, freely and independently. In particular, States should ensure that legal aid providers are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; are able to travel, to consult and meet with their clients freely and in full confidentiality both within their own country and abroad, and to freely access prosecution and other relevant files; and do not suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics. Principle 13. Competence and accountability of legal aid providers 37. States should put in place mechanisms to ensure that all legal aid providers possess education, training, skills and experience that are commensurate with the nature of their work, including the gravity of the offences dealt with, and the rights and needs of women, children and groups with special needs. 4 “Child” shall mean any person under 18 years of age, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. V.12-52823 38. Disciplinary complaints against legal aid providers should be promptly investigated and adjudicated in accordance with professional codes of ethics before an impartial body and subject to judicial review. Principle 14. Partnerships 39. States should recognize and encourage the contribution of lawyers’ associations, universities, civil society and other groups and institutions in providing legal aid. 40. Where appropriate, public-private and other forms of partnerships should be established to extend the reach of legal aid. C. Guidelines Guideline 1. Provision of legal aid 41. Whenever States apply a means test to determine eligibility for legal aid, they should ensure that: (a) Persons whose means exceed the limits of the means test but who cannot afford, or do not have access to, a lawyer in situations where legal aid would have otherwise been granted and where it is in the interests of justice to provide such aid, are not excluded from receiving assistance; (b) The criteria for applying the means test are widely publicized; (c) Persons urgently requiring legal aid at police stations, detention centres or courts should be provided preliminary legal aid while their eligibility is being determined. Children are always exempted from the means test; (d) Persons who are denied legal aid on the basis of the means test have the right to appeal that decision; (ce) A court may, having regard to the particular circumstances of a person and after considering the reasons for his or her refusal of legal aid, direct that that person be provided with legal aid, with or without his or her contribution, when the interests of justice so require; (f) If the means test is calculated on the basis of the household income of a family, but individual family members are in conflict with each other or do not have equal access to the family income, only the income of the person applying for legal aid is used for the purpose of the means test. Guideline 2. Right to be informed on legal aid 42. In order to guarantee the right of persons to be informed of their right to legal aid, States should ensure that: (a) Information on the right to legal aid and what such aid consists of, including the availability of legal aid services and how to access such services and other relevant information, is made available to the community and to the general public in local government offices and educational and religious institutions and through the media, including the Internet, or other appropriate means; V.12-52823 (b) Information is made available to isolated groups and marginalized groups.

Such information should be provided in a manner that corresponds to the needs of illiterate persons, minorities, persons with disabilities and children; and such information should be in a language that those persons understand. Information provided to children must be provided in a manner appropriate to their age and maturity; (ec) Effective remedies are available to persons who have not been adequately informed of their right to legal aid. Such remedies may include a prohibition on conducting procedural actions, release from detention, exclusion of evidence, judicial review and compensation; (f) Means of verification that a person has actually been informed are put in place. Guideline 3. Other rights of persons detained, arrested, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence 43. States should introduce measures: (a) To promptly inform every person detained, arrested, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence of his or her right to remain silent; his or her right to consult with counsel or, if eligible, with a legal aid provider at any stage of the proceedings, especially before being interviewed by the authorities; and his or her right to be assisted by an independent counsel or legal aid provider while being interviewed and during other procedural actions; (b) To prohibit, in the absence of any compelling circumstances, any interviewing of a person by the police in the absence of a lawyer, unless the person gives his or her informed and voluntary consent to waive the lawyer’s presence and to establish mechanisms for verifying the voluntary nature of the person’s consent. An interview should not start until the legal aid provider arrives; (c) To inform all foreign detainees and prisoners in a language they understand of their right to request contact with their consular authorities without delay; (d) To ensure that persons meet with a lawyer or a legal aid provider promptly after their arrest in full confidentiality; and that the confidentiality of further communications is guaranteed; (ec) To enable every person who has been detained for any reason to imminently notify a member of his or her family, or any other appropriate person of 10 his or her choosing, of his or her detention and location and of any imminent change of location; the competent authority may, however, delay a notification if absolutely necessary, if provided for by law and if the transmission of the information would hinder a criminal investigation; (f) To provide the services of an independent interpreter, whenever necessary, and the translation of documents where appropriate; (g) To assign a guardian, whenever necessary; (h) To make available in police stations and places of detention the means to contact legal aid providers; (i) To ensure that persons detained, arrested, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence are advised of their rights and the implications of waiving them in a clear and plain manner; and endeavour to ensure that the person understands both; (Gj) To ensure that persons are informed of any mechanism available for filing complaints against torture or ill treatment; (k) To ensure that the exercise of these rights by a person is not prejudicial to his or her case. Guideline 4. Legal aid at the pretrial stage 44. To ensure that detained persons have prompt access to legal aid in conformity with the law, States should take measures: (a) To ensure that police and judicial authorities do not arbitrarily restrict the right or access to legal aid for persons detained, arrested, suspected or accused of, or charged with a criminal offence, in particular in police stations; (b) To facilitate access for legal aid providers assigned to provide assistance to detained persons in police stations and other places of detention for the purpose of providing that assistance; (c) To ensure legal representation at all pretrial proceedings and hearings; (d) To monitor and enforce custody time limits in police holding cells or other detention centres, for example by instructing judicial authorities to screen the remand caseload in detention centres on a regular basis to make sure that people are remanded lawfully, that their cases are dealt with in a timely manner and that the conditions in which they are held meet the relevant legal standards, including international ones; (ec) To provide every person, on admission to a place of detention, with information on their rights in law, the rules of the place of detention and the initial stages of the pretrial process.

Guideline 5. Legal aid during court proceedings 45. To guarantee that every person charged with a criminal offence for which a term of imprisonment or capital punishment may be imposed by a court of law has access to legal aid in all proceedings at court, including on appeal and other related proceedings, States should introduce measures: (a) To ensure that the accused understands the case against him or her and the possible consequences of the trial; (b) To ensure that every person charged with a criminal offence has adequate time, facilities and technical and financial support, in case he or she does not have sufficient means, to prepare his or her defence and is able to consult with his or her lawyer in full confidentiality; (c) To provide representation in any court proceedings by a lawyer of choice, where appropriate, or by a competent lawyer assigned by the court or other legal aid authority at no cost when the person does not have sufficient means to pay and/or where the interests of justice so require; (d) To ensure that the counsel of the accused is present at all critical stages of the proceedings.

Where legal aid is not available, States shall ensure that such persons are held in prison in conformity with the law. 12 47. For this purpose, States should introduce measures: (a) To provide all persons, on admission to the place of imprisonment and during their detention, with information on the rules of the place of imprisonment and their rights under the law, including the right to confidential legal aid, advice and assistance; the possibilities for further review of their case; their rights during disciplinary proceedings; and procedures for complaint, appeal, early release, pardon or clemency. Such information should be provided in a manner that corresponds to the needs of illiterate persons, minorities, persons with disabilities and children and should be in a language that the person in need of legal aid understands. Information provided to children should be provided in a manner appropriate for their age and maturity.

and the need for persons with disabilities to be guaranteed their full enjoyment without discrimination, Affirming that ensuring and promoting the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all persons with disabilities, without distinction, is critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, Recalling its resolution 66/124 of 19 December 2011, by which it

Assembly, ® Recognizing that a major barrier to improving the health and well-being of children with ASD, DD and associated disabilities and their families is the paucity of knowledge and expertise to recognize symptoms and identify ASD, and also recognizing that the absence of effective routine screening that allows for early detection, in turn, limits access to care and early interventions and that, without research to develop and implement effective programmes, the emergence of appropriate solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD and their families does not occur, Acknowledging efforts to increase awareness of the rights of those affected by ASD, DD and associated disabilities, including the commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day, which led to
