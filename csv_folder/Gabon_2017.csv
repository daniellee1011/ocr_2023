development and should be an active participant in and the beneficiary of the right to development, Welcoming the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in which the parties acknowledge in the preamble that they should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations with regard to human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, the empowerment of women and intergenerational equity, Taking note of the outcomes of the twenty-second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Marrakech Action Proclamation for Our Climate and Sustainable Development, Recognizing that sustainable development and the protection of the environment, including ecosystems, contribute to human well-being and to the enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to life, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, to an adequate standard of living, to adequate food, to safe drinking water and sanitation and to housing, and cultural rights, Recognizing also, conversely, the impact of climate change, the unsustainable management and use of natural resources, the unsound management of chemicals and waste, the resulting loss of biodiversity and the decline in services provided by ecosystems may interfere with the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and that environmental damage can have negative implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing further the importance of gender equality, the empowerment of women and the role women play as managers of natural resources and agents of change in the safeguarding of the environment, Recognizing that, while the human rights implications of environmental damage are felt by individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable situations, Recognizing also that degradation and loss of biodiversity often result from and reinforce existing patterns of discrimination, and that environmental harm can have disastrous, and at times geographically dispersed consequences on the quality of life of A/HRC/34/L.33 indigenous peoples, local communities, peasants and others who rely directly on the products of forests, rivers, lakes, wetlands and oceans for their food, fuel and medicine, resulting in further inequality and marginalization, Acknowledging that wetlands are the ecosystem with the highest rate of loss and degradation, and aware that indicators of current trends suggest that pressure on biodiversity and wetlands will increase in the years to come, Recognizing the key role that wetlands play in maintaining water quantity and quality, among other things, and recalling General Assembly resolutions 68/157 of 18 December 2013 and 70/169 of 17 December 2015 on safe drinking water and sanitation, which are essential for the full enjoyment of all human rights, Recognizing also the need to change human development patterns, behaviour and activities to respect nature as a fundamental condition for the well-being of all forms of life, which depend on the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and the ecosystem services it underpins, and in this regard, recalling Goal 12 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns, and target 12.1 on implementing the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns, 1.
