nutrition security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions, societies and economies where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential, Recognizing that, despite the efforts made and the fact that some positive results have been achieved, the problems of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition have a global dimension, that there has not been sufficient progress in reducing hunger and that these problems are increasing dramatically in some regions in the absence of urgent, determined and concerted action, Recognizing also the importance of traditional sustainable agricultural practices, including traditional seed supply systems, as well as access to credit and other financial services, markets, secure land tenure, health care, social services, education, training, knowledge and appropriate and affordable technologies, including efficient irrigation, the reuse of treated wastewater and water harvesting and storage for indigenous peoples and

financial and economic crisis, environmental degradation, desertification and the impacts of global climate change, as well as poverty, natural disasters, armed conflicts, drought, volatility in commodity prices and the lack in many countries of the appropriate technology, investment and capacity-building necessary to confront its impact, particularly in developing countries, the least developed countries and small island developing States, and the need for coherence and collaboration between international institutions at the global level, Noting with great concern that millions of people are facing famine or the immediate risk of famine or are experiencing severe food insecurity in several regions of the world, and noting also that poverty, armed conflicts, drought and the

practices and policies to scale up sustainable agroecological approaches, Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and pest infestations, as well as the negative impact of climate change, and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in substantial loss of life and livelihood and threatened agricultural production and food and nutrition security, in particular in developing countries, Concerned that the impacts of climate change and natural disasters are harming agricultural productivity, food production and cropping patterns, thus contributing to food availability shortfalls, and that such impacts are expected to increase with future climate change, Expressing its deep concern over the negative effects of armed conflicts on the enjoyment of the right to food, Emphasizing that a multisectoral approach that integrates nutrition across all sectors, including agriculture, health, water and sanitation, social protection and education, as well as a gender perspective, is critical to achieving global food and nutrition security and the realization of the right to food, Recalling the endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security!° by the Committee on World Food Security at its thirty-eighth session, held on 11 May 2012, and by the Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations at its 144th session, Recalling also the Principles for Responsible Investment in
