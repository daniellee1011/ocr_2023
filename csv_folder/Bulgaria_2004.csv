the protection of internally displaced persons has been strengthened by identifying, reaffirming and consolidating specific standards for their protection, in particular through the Guiding Principles

the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international human rights instruments, and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of violence against women, Reaffirming the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted in June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/104 of 20 December 1993, Recalling the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted in September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women, follow-up action by the Commission on the Status of Women on violence against women, and the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled “Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century”, Recalling also all its previous

crime against humanity and/or a war crime, and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international

or remote communities, destitute women, women in institutions or in detention, the girl child, women with disabilities, elderly women, widows and women in situations of armed conflict are often especially targeted or vulnerable to violence, as are women who are otherwise discriminated against, Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls, and can be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the

of national legislation, against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple forms of discrimination against women, Welcomes: (a) The work of the
