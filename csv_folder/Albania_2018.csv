also the fact that, according to a report by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation in 2015, an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking

basic water service, 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.5 billion people lack access to safely managed

and has been instrumental in developing global norms to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-

that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres, and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions, and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes, or practising open defecation,

A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 International Conference on Financing for Development and in the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Recognizing that respect for and the protection and fulfilment of the full enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls and the full implementation of all Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda, including Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls and target 3.1 on reducing global maternal mortality, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health, such as inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, and particularly in humanitarian settings, and that a dramatic and sustainable scaling up of quality treatment and health-care services, including high-quality emergency obstetric services and also of the number of trained, competent fistula surgeons and midwives, is needed to significantly reduce maternal and new-born mortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, Recognizing also that humanitarian settings may exacerbate pre-existing patterns and structures of discrimination and inequalities and further undermine access to health care, information and services, housing, water, sanitation, education and employment for women and girls, and that in affected areas access to essential services, such as health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, are disrupted owing to inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional health-care workers, basic medicines and health-care supplies and survivor-centred referral pathways for all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further that, in humanitarian settings, disintegrating judicial systems, gender-based discrimination and discrimination against refugees in host countries, fear of reprisals against their families or themselves, and the stigma associated with sexual and gender-based violence all prevent women and girl survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and those denied access to sexual and reproductive health-care services from reporting sexual violence and seeking justice, accountability and remedies for the violations they have endured, Deeply concerned that women and girls living in humanitarian settings are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of violation of their rights, including through trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, and lack of accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, and lack of access to water and sanitation, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, A/HRC/39/L.13/Rev.1 Reaffirming that human rights include the right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates between countries, but also within countries, and between women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, which creates the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Deeply concerned that in countries affected by humanitarian situations, the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54 compared to | in 180 globally, and that the majority of preventable maternal deaths have occurred in settings of armed conflict, natural disasters and displacement, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, both globally and in humanitarian settings, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Recognizing the need for further disaggregated data on maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and for access to sexual and reproductive health-care services in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, and recognizing the need to bridge the humanitarian- development divide, 1.

A/HRC/39/L.13 Conference on Financing for Development and in the means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda, Recognizing that respect for and the protection and fulfilment of the full enjoyment of human rights by all women and girls and the full implementation of all Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda, including Goal 5 on achieving gender equality and empower all women and girls and target 3.1 on reducing global maternal mortality, are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, Recognizing that sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are integral to the realization of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, and that comprehensive sexual and reproductive health-care services must have the interrelated and essential elements of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality, on the basis of non-discrimination and formal and substantive equality, including by addressing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, Deeply concerned that there are continuing violations of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including the right to sexual and reproductive health, which have a negative impact on rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, and that the full enjoyment of this right remains a distant goal for many women and girls throughout the world, Recognizing that violations of the right to sexual and reproductive health, including inadequate emergency obstetric services and unsafe abortion, can cause high levels of maternal morbidity, including obstetric fistula, leading to ill health and death for women and girls of childbearing age in many regions of the world, and particularly in humanitarian settings, and that a dramatic and sustainable scaling up of quality treatment and health-care services, including high-quality emergency obstetric services and also of the number of trained, competent fistula surgeons and midwives, is needed to significantly reduce maternal and new-born mortality and to eradicate obstetric fistula, Recognizing also that humanitarian settings may exacerbate pre-existing patterns and structures of discrimination and inequalities and further undermine access to health care, information and services, housing, water, sanitation, education and employment for women and girls, and that in affected areas access to essential services, such as health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, are disrupted owing to inadequate infrastructure, lack of professional health-care workers, basic medicines and health-care supplies and survivor-centred referral pathways for all survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, Recognizing further that, in humanitarian settings, disintegrating judicial systems, discrimination on the basis of gender and against refugee populations in host countries, fear of reprisals against their families or themselves, and the stigma associated with sexual and gender-based violence all prevent women and girl survivors of sexual and gender-based violence and those denied access to sexual and reproductive health-care services from reporting sexual violence and seeking justice, accountability and remedies for the violations they have endured, Deeply concerned that women and girls living in humanitarian settings are disproportionately exposed to a high risk of violation of their rights, including through trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, systematic rape, sexual slavery, forced sterilization, forced pregnancy, harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, and lack of accessible and appropriate sexual and reproductive health-care services, evidence-based information and education, including comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, lack of access to perinatal care, including skilled birth attendance, and emergency obstetric care, poverty, underdevelopment, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to medicines and medical equipment, human and material shortages facing health-care systems, humanitarian and funding shortages affecting hospitals, technical assistance, capacity-building and training needs, and lack of access to water and sanitation, resulting in heightened risks of unwanted pregnancies, unsafe abortion and maternal mortality and morbidity, A/HRC/39/L.13 Reaffirming that the human rights of women and girls include their right to have control over and to decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, and that equal relationships in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for their dignity, integrity and bodily autonomy, require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences, Recognizing that there are large disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity rates between countries, but also within countries, and between women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, and noting with concern that the risk of maternal mortality is higher for adolescents and highest for adolescent girls under 15 years of age, and that complications in pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries, which creates the need to address all social, economic and environment determinants of health in order to reduce the aforementioned disparities, Deeply concerned that in countries designated as fragile States, the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54 compared to 1 in 180 globally, and that the majority of preventable maternal deaths have occurred in settings of conflict, natural disasters and displacement, Convinced that greater political will and commitment, international cooperation and technical assistance at all levels are urgently required to reduce the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, both globally and in humanitarian settings, and that the integration of a human rights-based approach to the provision of sexual and reproductive health-care services can contribute positively to the common goal of reducing that rate, Recognizing the need for further disaggregated data on maternal mortality and morbidity rates, and for access to sexual and reproductive health-care services in humanitarian settings, Acknowledging that the failure to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity is one of the most significant barriers to the empowerment of women and girls in all aspects of life, the full enjoyment of their human rights, their ability to reach their full potential and to sustainable development in general, and recognizing the need to bridge the humanitarian- development divide, 1. Urges all States to eliminate preventable maternal mortality and to respect, protect and fulfil sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, in accordance with the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and their review conference and outcome documents, and the right of everyone to have full control over and decide freely and responsibly on all matters relating to their sexuality and sexual and reproductive health, free from discrimination, coercion and violence, including through the removal of legal barriers and the development and enforcement of policies, good practices and legal frameworks that respect the right to bodily autonomy and guarantee universal access to sexual and reproductive health, services, evidence-based information and education within a human rights-based approach, including for family planning, safe and effective methods of modern contraception, emergency contraception, universal access to health care, including quality maternal health care, such as skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, safe abortion in accordance with international human rights law and standards and where not against national law, the prevention and treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV and reproductive cancers, and the integration of sexual and reproductive health into national health strategies and programmes for all women and girls, including adolescents; 2.

Urges States to ensure that laws, policies and practices respect women’s and girls’ right to bodily autonomy and privacy by bringing laws and policies concerning sexual and reproductive health, including international assistance policies, into line with international human rights standards and repealing discriminatory laws relating to third- party authorization for health information and services, and combating gender stereotypes, norms and behaviours that are discriminatory; 10. Also urges States to ensure access to justice and accountability mechanisms and timely and effective remedies for the effective implementation and enforcement of laws aimed at preventing violations of the right to sexual and reproductive health, including A/HRC/39/L.13 those aimed at preventing maternal mortality and morbidity, including in humanitarian settings, such as by informing women and girls of their rights under relevant international and domestic law, and by improving legal and health infrastructure and removing all barriers in access to legal counselling, assistance and remedies; 11. Further urges States to ensure accountability and gender-sensitive, prompt and effective remedies for the violation of the rights of women and girls in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity in humanitarian settings by including transparent forms of monitoring, review and oversight of humanitarian programmes and policies, including the monitoring of inequities; 12. Calls upon States to support gender equality and women’s and girls’ rights, including within families, through awareness-raising initiatives, including in schools and in displaced and refugee camps and settlements, especially education and public awareness- raising, including through the media and online, the incorporation of curricula on all women’s and girls’ rights into teacher training courses, including the prevention of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, and ensuring universal access to evidence- based comprehensive sexuality education consistent with the evolving capacities of the child; 13. Urges States and encourages other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations, to take action at all levels, utilizing a comprehensive human rights-based approach to address the interlinked causes of maternal mortality and morbidity, such as lack of accessible, affordable and appropriate health-care services for all, and of information and education, lack of access to medicine, all types of malnutrition, lack of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, poverty, harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation, early childbearing, gender-based inequalities and all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and to take concrete measures to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, especially adolescent girls, and to ensure access to accountability for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, including effective reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence, such as the prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence committed in humanitarian settings, while ensuring the meaningful and effective participation of women and girls in the relevant processes; 14.
