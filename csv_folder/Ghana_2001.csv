Welcomes the report submitted by the independent expert on the effects of structural adjustment policies and foreign debt on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-seventh session (E/CN.4/2001/56), commends the independent expert for his valuable work and encourages him to continue studying these issues further; 2. Stresses that structural adjustment policies have serious implications for the ability of the developing countries to abide by the Declaration on the Right to Development and to formulate national development policies that aim to improve the economic, social and cultural rights of their citizens; 3. Notes with concern the persistence of the external debt problem, that the vicious cycle of debt and underdevelopment has become further entrenched, that debt service has grown at a much greater rate than the debt itself and that the burden of payments has become heavier in many developing countries, including those with low and middle incomes, despite repeated rescheduling, and that the current debt and poverty reduction and growth initiatives lack sufficient funding and have several conditions attached; 4. Recalls the pledge, contained in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session (resolution S-24/2, of 1 July 2000, annex, chap. ]) to find effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries; 5. Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based, inter alia, in open, equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, predictable, transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems, which guarantees the developing countries, inter alia, better market conditions and commodity prices, stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates, easier access to financial and capital markets, adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries; 6. Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated, on an equal footing and a consistent way, with the realization of the broader social development goals, taking into account the specific characteristics, conditions and needs of the debtor countries; 7. Affirms that the exercise of the basic rights of the people of debtor countries to food, housing, clothing, employment, education, health services and a healthy environment cannot be subordinated to the implementation of structural adjustment polices, growth programmes and economic reforms arising from the debt; 8. Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt, in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms, to be extended, expedited, implemented completely and made more flexible, and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives, which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis; 9. Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources, in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation, and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms, as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms, combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development; 10.
