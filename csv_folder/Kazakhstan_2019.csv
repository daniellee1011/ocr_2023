That war, unprecedented in its scale and ferocity, turned into a great tragedy for the peoples of Europe, Asia and the world. A threat to the very basic principles of civilization was averted at the cost of colossal joint efforts and grave losses. Through the suffering and death of millions of people, the world community came to realize the indispensability of a system of collective security and the necessity of establishing reliable machinery to ensure international peace. The burning desire to spare humanity forever from the miseries of war inspired States to establish a reliable mechanism for maintaining international peace and security — the United Nations. The objectives set for the Organization when established are still relevant. Among them are the strengthening of an equitable world order based on the principles of humanism and mutually beneficial cooperation, the effective maintenance of international peace and security, and the promotion of sustained development in the political, socioeconomic and other spheres. Today we need to remember the lessons of the Second World War and to work to promote the preservation of the historical memory of peoples. The perception of the victory won in 1945 as a common value for all of humanity is essential for the coming together of the international community to address dangerous modern challenges and threats. The memory of the victory over fascism is also relevant in terms of preventing attempts to revise the results of the Second World War and the conclusions of the Nuremberg Tribunal and the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as well as in the light of the objectives of the United Nations to oppose crimes based on race, nationality and ethnic origin and the spread of ideas of intolerance and related contemporary forms of racial discrimination. It is in the direct interest of humanity to further strengthen the role and effectiveness of the United Nations as the central element in the collective security system designed to put into practice the high goal proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations — “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Consideration of this agenda item could lead to the adoption by the General Assembly of a resolution on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Second World War. This would make it possible to hold a special solemn meeting of the General Assembly in memory of all victims of the war. 3/4 A/74/290 Annex IT Draft resolution Seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War The General Assembly, Recalling its resolution 59/26 of 22 November 2004, in which it, inter alia, declared 8 and 9 May as a time of remembrance and reconciliation, while recognizing that Member States may have individual dates of victory, liberation and commemoration, Recalling that 2020 will mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a war which brought untold sorrow to mankind, particularly in Asia and Europe, Stressing that this historic event established the conditions for the creation of the United Nations, designed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, Calling upon the States Members of the United Nations to unite their efforts in dealing with new challenges and threats, with the United Nations playing a central role, and to make every effort to settle all disputes by peaceful means in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered, Underlining the progress made since the end of the Second World War in overcoming its legacy and towards reconciliation, international and regional cooperation and the promotion of democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular through the United Nations, and the establishment of regional organizations and other appropriate frameworks, 1.

Recognizes that many children living without parental care have families, including at least one parent alive and/or relatives, and in this regard encourages actions to achieve family reunification unless it is not in the best interests of the child; 28. Stresses that no child should be forced to give up family connections in order to escape poverty, or to receive care, comprehensive, timely and quality health services or education, or because they are in contact with the law; 29.

Also recognizes that financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from the care of his or her parents or primary caregivers and legal guardians, for receiving a child into alternative care or for preventing his or her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for the need to provide appropriate support to their family, benefiting the child directly; 31. Urges States to strengthen child welfare and child protection systems and improve care reform efforts, which should include increased multisectoral collaboration, inter alia, between child welfare and health, education and justice sectors, active coordination among all relevant authorities, improved cross-border systems and improved capacity-building and training programmes for relevant stakeholders; 32.

Calls upon States to take all measures necessary to prevent and combat illegal adoptions and all adoptions that are not in the best interests of the child; 34. Urges States to take effective action to provide support to families and to prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their parents, including by: (a) Prioritizing investments in child protection services and social services to support quality alternative care, including families and communities in order to prevent the separation of children from their families, with the best interests of the child as the primary consideration;

(f) Developing and strengthening inclusive and responsive family-oriented policies and programmes for poverty reduction, also designed to promote and strengthen parents’ ability to care for their children, and to confront family poverty and social exclusion, recognizing the multidimensional aspects of poverty, focusing on inclusive and quality education and lifelong learning for all, including initiatives to promote involved and positive parenting, health and well-being for all at all ages, equal access to economic resources, full and productive employment, decent work, social security, livelihoods and social cohesion and promoting and protecting the human rights of all family members; (g) Providing gender-sensitive and child-sensitive social protection systems, which are key to ensuring poverty reduction, including, as appropriate, targeted cash transfers for families in vulnerable situations, as can be the case of families headed by a single parent, in particular those headed by women or by children, and which are most effective in reducing poverty when accompanied by other measures, such as providing access to basic services, high-quality education, affordable quality childcare services and health-care services; (h) Supporting and assisting families’ and caregivers’ capacities in regard to child development, including through comprehensive education and training, and the promotion of involved and positive parenting to enable them to provide children with care in a safe environment;

Also urges States to take action to ensure the enjoyment of human rights for all children without parental care, in accordance with the international human rights framework, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, not least the rights to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health, education, to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to the age and maturity of the child, and also to take action to provide a range of alternative care options and to protect all children without parental care, including by: (a) Promoting the implementation of international frameworks, notably the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, including through training on the Guidelines for care staff and others working with children, and strengthening national legislation, regulations and policies to protect the rights of children without parental care; (b) Ensuring the availability of a comprehensive range of quality accessible and disability-inclusive alternative care options, in the best interests of the child and on a case-by-case basis, in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and by taking into account the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children, for emergency, short-term and long-term care;
