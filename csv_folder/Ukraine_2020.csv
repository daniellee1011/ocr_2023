Takes note with deep concern of the recent conclusions of the Commission of Inquiry in its conference room paper entitled ““They have erased the dreams of my children’: children’s rights in the Syrian Arab Republic’”,’ that an overwhelming impact of the conflict is that children remain victimized on multiple grounds and continue to be denied the protection to which they are entitled under international humanitarian and international human rights law, and encourages the Commission to continue its investigation and documentation of violations and abuses of the rights of the child, including potential recommendations for accountability measures; 22. Deplores the fact that children continue to be subjected to serious violations and abuses, including being killed, abducted, used or recruited by armed actors, and being maimed, injured and orphaned, bearing the brunt of the violence perpetrated by warring parties, strongly condemns the use of schools for military purposes, and takes note of the Commission of Inquiry’s finding that children’s experiences in the Syrian conflict have been deeply gendered; 23. Also deplores the fact that the unprecedented and recurrent nature of violations and abuses against children has affected generations to come, and that the psychological impact of the conflict on children has been a striking feature of the war in the Syrian Arab Republic with far-reaching consequences, and urges all parties to ensure that children affected by the conflict receive appropriate health treatment, including the provision of mental health and psychosocial support; 24. Calls upon all parties to respect and protect the full enjoyment by children of all their human rights, to ensure access to basic services, such as medical care and education, 3 Available from https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICIS yria/Pages/Documentation.aspx. A/HRC/43/L.33 and to provide official documents such as birth and educational certificates, and to allow at all times humanitarian workers to reach children and families in need of life-saving assistance, and to prevent and protect children from all exploitation, violations and abuses, including sexual and gender-based violence and child, early and forced marriage, trafficking and torture by, among other actions, ending and preventing the recruitment and use of children in the armed conflict, immediately, safely and unconditionally releasing children and handing them over to civilian child-protection actors, and ensuring that such authorities have access to detained children associated with armed groups; 25. Calls upon the Syrian authorities and all other parties to the conflict to ensure the effective implementation of Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) of 22 February 2014 and 2254 (2015), 1325 (2000) and 2122 (2013) of 18 October 2013 and to adhere to their obligations under international law, in particular to end arbitrary detention, torture and sexual and gender-based violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, notably in prisons and detention facilities, as well as kidnappings, abductions and forced disappearances, as demanded by the Council in its resolution 2139 (2014) and by the Commission of Inquiry in its recommendations; 26. Expresses deep concern at reports of mass executions and torture of prisoners, and at the number of deaths among individuals detained by the Syrian authorities, including in Syrian Military Intelligence facilities and military hospitals, as evidenced by the issuing of thousands of death notifications, which provides further indication of systematic violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, and urges them to provide families with death certificates and the remains of their relatives whose fate has been disclosed, including those who have been summarily executed, to take all appropriate measures immediately to protect the lives and rights of all persons currently detained or unaccounted for, and to clarify the fate of those who remain missing or are still in custody; 27. Recognizes the permanent damage that torture and ill-treatment, including sexual and gender-based abuse and violence, causes to its victims and their families, and condemns the denial of medical services in all prisons and detention facilities; 28. Strongly condemns the use of sexual and gender-based violence, torture and ill-treatment, particularly in detention facilities run by the Syrian authorities, including those acts referenced by the Commission of Inquiry in its reports and those depicted in the evidence presented by “Caesar” in January 2014, and recalls that such acts may constitute violations and abuses of international human rights law or violations of international humanitarian law; 29. Also strongly condemns the continued widespread practices of enforced disappearance and arbitrary detention, notably widespread in areas where the Syrian authorities have retaken control, and notes that the Commission of Inquiry has comprehensively highlighted that the arbitrary detention of tens of thousands of individuals represents an urgent and large-scale crisis of human rights protection; 30. Urges all parties to take heed of the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry on the issue of detainees, in particular its calls for appropriate international monitoring bodies to be granted immediate access without undue restriction to all detainees and detention facilities, and for all parties, in particular the Syrian authorities, to publish a list of all detention facilities, to allow access to medical services for all detainees and to provide information on those whom they have detained to their families; 31. | Demands the immediate release of all persons arbitrarily detained, including women, children, older persons, persons with disabilities, human rights defenders, humanitarian aid providers, medical personnel, the wounded and sick, and journalists, and notes the importance of ensuring justice for those arbitrarily detained; 32.

Welcomes Security Council resolution 2474 (2019) of 11 June 2019, and calls upon parties to the armed conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic to take all appropriate A/HRC/43/L.33 measures to actively search for persons reported missing, to enable the return of their remains, to record and identify all those killed, to account for persons reported missing without adverse distinction, and to put in place appropriate channels enabling response and communication with families on the search and recording process, to take appropriate measures to prevent persons from going missing as a result of the armed conflict, while paying utmost attention to cases of children reported missing as a result of the armed conflict, and to take appropriate measures to search for and identify those children; 34. Expresses its profound concern at the findings of the Commission of Inquiry that sexual and gender-based violence against women, girls, men and boys has been a persistent issue in the Syrian Arab Republic since the uprising in 2011, that rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence continue to occur, and that women and girls have been disproportionately affected and victimized on multiple grounds; 35. Notes the findings of the Commission of Inquiry that such acts of sexual and gender-based violence were committed most commonly by Syrian authorities and associated militia, as well as by so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), that they represent a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population, amounting to crimes against humanity, and that such acts constitute the war crimes of rape and other forms of sexual violence, including torture and outrages upon personal dignity; 36. Strongly condemns all acts of sexual and gender-based violence and abuse, recognizes the need for a survivor-centred approach in preventing and responding to such violence and abuse, calls for immediate and non-discriminatory access to services, such as medical and psychosocial support to be provided to all survivors of such crimes and for every effort to be made to ensure justice for those who have suffered as a result of such crimes, and urges all parties to the conflict to respect and protect women’s and girls’ full enjoyment of human rights and to heed the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry; 37. Condemns unequivocally all attacks, threats, intimidation and violence against journalists and media workers by the Syrian regime, its State and non-State allies, and non- State armed groups, strongly urges all parties to respect the human rights of journalists and media workers, and recalls in this regard that journalists and media workers shall be considered civilians and shall be protected as such; 38. Strongly condemns violence against persons based on their religious or ethnic affiliation, demands that all parties take all appropriate steps to protect civilians, including members of ethnic, religious and confessional communities, and stresses that, in this regard, the primary responsibility to protect the Syrian population lies with the Syrian authorities; 39. Also strongly condemns the damage and destruction of the cultural heritage of the Syrian Arab Republic, in particular that of Palmyra and Aleppo, and the organized looting and trafficking of Syrian cultural property, as outlined by the Security Council in its resolution 2199 (2015) of 12 February 2015, affirms that attacks intentionally directed against historic monuments may amount to war crimes, and underlines the need to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice; 40. Expresses deep concern at the displacement of approximately 13 million civilians, including 6.1 million internally displaced persons across the Syrian Arab Republic, and urges all parties to take note of the recommendations on this matter made by the Commission of Inquiry, and to ensure that any evacuation and movement of civilians is consistent with international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable; 41. | Condemns the reported forced displacement of populations in the Syrian Arab Republic, expresses deep concern at reports of social and demographic engineering in areas throughout the country, and calls upon all parties concerned to cease immediately all activities that cause these actions, including any activities that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity; 42. Expresses deep concern for the more than 5.6 million registered refugees in the region fleeing the violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, welcomes the efforts of the neighbouring countries, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, as well as of Egypt, to host Syrian refugees, acknowledges the socioeconomic consequences of the presence of large-scale A/HRC/43/L.33 refugee populations in those countries and urges the international community to provide urgent financial support to enable the host countries to respond to the growing humanitarian needs of Syrian refugees, including the particular needs of women, girls and persons with disabilities, while emphasizing the principles of responsibility and burden-sharing; 43. Notes those States outside the region that have put in place measures and policies to assist and to host Syrian refugees, encourages them to do more, and also encourages other States outside the region to consider implementing similar measures and policies, also with a view to providing Syrian refugees with protection and humanitarian assistance; 44. Notes with concern that one of the main obstacles to refugees’ safe, voluntary and dignified return to their country of origin derive from the Syrian authorities’ own practices of violating the human rights of civilians in areas under their control, including the rights to the freedoms of assembly, movement and expression, as well as those involving systematic property seizures, forced conscription, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, political violence or torture; 45. Expresses concern at reports that the Syrian authorities are arbitrarily preventing internally displaced persons from accessing and returning to their homes, with no apparently valid security reason and without providing alternatives to the displaced communities, which may amount to forced displacement; 46. Deplores in this regard the existence and application of national legislation, in particular Law No. 42/2018 and other legislation and practices concerning housing, land and property rights, which have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property, as evidenced by recent reports of widespread property demolitions throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, calls for the immediate repeal of that legislation, and stresses the right of displaced Syrians to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it; 47. Expresses concern that the hostilities have restricted access to or resulted in the loss of civil documentation, including through confiscation, thereby limiting freedom of movement, access to essential services, and housing, land and property rights, particularly for children, persons with disabilities, women and female-headed households, and notes that the lack of casualty records and official death certificates can seriously affect inheritance and custody rights and severely restricts freedom of movement; 48. Urges all parties to implement the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry on ensuring that the right of return is fully respected and facilitated by guaranteeing that all return movements are safe, voluntary and dignified and subject to informed consent to the places of origin and protect all property and tenancy rights, in cooperation with competent organizations, such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; 49. Condemns in the strongest possible terms the repeated use of chemical weapons by the Syrian authorities, in violation of its obligations under the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction and Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), and all use of chemical weapons in contravention of well-established international standards and norms against such use; 50. Expresses grave concern at the reports of the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which state that it continues to be unable to verify that the declaration made by the Syrian authorities regarding their chemical weapons programme was accurate and complete in accordance with the Chemical Weapons Convention, and calls upon the Syrian Arab Republic to cooperate fully with the Organisation to provide further clarification relating to the gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies that remain; 51. Welcomes the fact that the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has completed its arrangements for the establishment of the Investigation and Identification Team tasked to identify the perpetrators of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic by identifying and reporting on all A/HRC/43/L.33 information potentially relevant to the origin of those chemical weapons, looks forward to the Team’s first report, and calls upon the Syrian authorities to provide all necessary access and authorizations to the members of the Team; 52. Recalls the relevant reports of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism, in which they found that the Syrian authorities were responsible for the use of chemical weapons on four occasions, and that the Joint Investigative Mechanism also confirmed that so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh) was responsible for two chemical weapons attacks between 2014 and 2017; 53. | Expresses grave concern at the findings by the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that sarin and chlorine were very likely used in separate attacks in Ltamenah on 24 and 25 March 2017, and that chlorine was likely used in an attack in Saraqib on 4 February 2018; 54. Recalls with grave concern the finding by the Commission of Inquiry of a vast body of evidence suggesting that chlorine was dropped by helicopter on a residential building in Duma on 7 April 2018, that the Commission had received information on the deaths of at least 49 individuals and the wounding of up to 650 others, and at the findings of the Commission in the same report that, in a series of ground attacks in Duma on 22 January and 1 February 2018, the Syrian authorities and/or affiliated militias had committed the war crime of using chemical weapons, following a pattern previously documented by the Commission; 55. Recalls the findings of the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in its report of 1 March 2019 that, on the basis of its evaluation and analysis of all the information gathered, there were reasonable grounds that a toxic chemical was used as a weapon in Duma on 7 April 2018, and that the toxic chemical was likely molecular chlorine; 56. Demands that all parties desist immediately from any use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, expresses its strong conviction that those responsible for such use must be held accountable, and expresses its support for the objectives and commitments of the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons to support accountability for all those responsible for the proliferation or use of chemical weapons; 57. Strongly condemns the terrorist acts and violence committed against civilians by so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), Al-Nusrah Front (also known as Hay’ at Tahrir al-Sham) and other terrorist organizations designated by the Security Council, and their gross, systematic and widespread abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law, reaffirms that terrorism, including the actions of so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality or civilization, and stresses the importance of the full implementation of Security Council resolution 2170 (2014) of 15 August 2014; 58. | Expresses deep concern about the documented cases of civilians, including women and children, taken hostage by so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Daesh), calls for their immediate release, notes that hostage-taking and the murder of civilians may constitute a war crime, condemns the recent reported mass arbitrary arrests and detention of civilians by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, and notes that imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of international law, when committed as part of a deliberate widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, may amount to a crime against humanity; 59. Reaffirms the importance of establishing appropriate processes and mechanisms to achieve justice, reconciliation, truth and accountability for gross violations and abuses of international law, and reparations and effective remedies for victims, in particular detainees, internally displaced persons and disappeared persons, children and victims of sexual and gender-based violence, and stresses the prerequisite role that accountability can play in any effort to bring about a sustainable, inclusive and peaceful conclusion to the conflict; 60. Recalls that the International Criminal Court was established to contribute to ending impunity for applicable crimes in which a State is unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out investigations or prosecutions; A/HRC/43/L.33 61. Emphasizes the need to ensure that all those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of international human rights law are held to account through appropriate, fair and independent national, regional or international criminal justice mechanisms, and stresses the need to pursue practical steps towards this goal, while noting the important role that the International Criminal Court can play in this regard, and noting the authority of the Security Council to refer such situations to the Court; 62. Welcomes the work of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, as mandated by the General Assembly in resolution 71/248 of 21 December 2016, including its close cooperation with the Commission of Inquiry and Syrian civil society, so that the voices of victims are heard, any evidence of crimes is collected and criminal prosecution proceeds; 63. Also welcomes the decision made by the General Assembly to include full funding of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism in the regular budget of the United Nations, and invites Member States to actively support the Mechanism, including by considering the provision of information and data on the most serious crimes under international law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to provide adequate financial means for its functioning, on a sustainable basis, in accordance with relevant Assembly resolutions; 64. Further welcomes the steps taken by Member States to prosecute the most serious crimes under international law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic in national courts under the principles of universal jurisdiction and extraterritorial jurisdiction as an important contribution to end impunity and ensure justice for victims, and notes the contribution that the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism and other accountability mechanisms can make in this regard; 65. Welcomes the relevant international campaigns and initiatives to support the Syrian people, including the upcoming conference to be hosted by the European Union and co-chaired by the United Nations in Brussels in June 2020, and renews its call for the international community to deliver in full all such pledges; 66. Reaffirms that there can only be a political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, demands that all parties work towards a genuine political transition based on the Geneva communiqué and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), within the framework of the United Nations-led intra-Syrian talks in Geneva and with the equal voice and full and meaningful leadership and participation of women in decision-making and in all efforts consistent with Council resolution 1325 (2000) and subsequent resolutions on women, peace and security, that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people for a civil, democratic and pluralistic State, in which all citizens receive equal protection, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion or belief, and welcomes the inclusion of civil society in this process; 67.

sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights, and resolution 74/141 of 18 December 2019, Reaffirming all previous resolutions of the Human Rights Council on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, inter alia, Council resolution 39/8 of 27 September 2018, Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International

the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation are derived from the right to an adequate standard of living and are inextricably related to the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to the right to life and human dignity, Recalling further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which reaffirms that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that human rights must be treated globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the GE.20-12504(E) Please recycle eS A/HRC/45/L.28 same emphasis, and that it is the duty of States to promote and protect all human rights, and which also reaffirms the right to development, Reaffirming General Assembly resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development’, in which States pledged to leave no one behind, Recalling that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development covers the issue of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, which comprises important targets relating to the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, as well as health and hygiene, and acknowledges the need for an integrated approach to Goal 6 that reflects the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water, reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity and ensure special attention to the needs and rights of women and girls, Recalling also that 10 years after the recognition of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, integrated approaches that support the practical realization of the human rights to water and sanitation, particularly by tackling inequalities and ensuring special attention to the needs and rights of all women and girls, are more pertinent than ever before, also in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Recognizing the need to pursue these integrated approaches to the implementation of Goal 6 and other water-related Sustainable Development Goals that reflect the interlinkages between achieving universal and equitable access to safe drinking water, sanitation and personal hygiene, in particular for women and girls, to enable menstrual management in a dignified and healthy way, while also striving to improve the quality and safety of water and to reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity, Recalling General Assembly resolution 71/222 of 21 December 2016, by which the Assembly proclaimed the period from 2018 to 2028 the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, Noting the work of the High-level Panel on Water, jointly convened by the United Nations and the World Bank Group, in order to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation-related services in line with Sustainable Development Goal 6 and taking note of its outcome document of 14 March 2018, Noting also the relevant commitments and initiatives promoting the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation made at recent regional and subregional conferences and meetings, Welcoming the work of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund in the 2019 update published by their Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, Welcoming also the fact that, according to a report of the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene, in 2019, 1.6 billion people gained access to safe drinking water between 2000 and 2017 and that an estimated 71 per cent of the global population uses a safely managed drinking water service system, while being deeply concerned, however, that 12 per cent of the global population still lacks even a basic drinking water system, Deeply concerned that 785 million people lack a basic water service, 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water that is available when needed and free from contamination in their homes, 4.2 billion people lack access to a safely managed sanitation service and 673 million people still practise open defecation, Deeply alarmed about the fact that, according to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2020, scarcity of water could displace an estimated 700 million people by 2030, Welcoming the fact that the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and A/HRC/45/L.28 Hygiene has established an extensive global database and has been instrumental in developing global norms by which to benchmark progress, while taking into consideration the fact that official figures do not always capture all the dimensions of the human rights to water and sanitation, Deeply concerned that the lack of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene underlies severe human costs, such as poor health and high mortality rates, and major economic losses, and affirming that affordability, accessibility, availability and quality, as human rights criteria ensuring the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, require, inter alia, that water, sanitation and hygiene facilities and services are within the safe physical reach of all sections of the population without discrimination of any kind and are accessible at a price that is affordable to all, Recognizing that sustained access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities is essential to preventing infectious diseases and that people without or with inadequate access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are at a much higher risk of contracting and passing on diseases, Deeply concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic perpetuates and exacerbates existing inequalities and that those most at risk are persons in vulnerable and marginalized situations, recognizing the need to expand as a matter of utmost urgency access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, and to ensure continued access to existing services in this regard, and gravely concerned that 3 billion people worldwide lack basic hand-washing facilities at home, which is the most effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable and marginalized situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island developing States and the least developed countries, rural and local communities and people facing desertification, land degradation, drought and water scarcity, as well as rising water levels due to storm surges, sea level rise and flooding, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water, when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or when, in the absence of adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, which limits their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, A/HRC/45/L.28 Deeply concerned also that persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities, as such facilities are often inaccessible and inappropriate for meeting their needs, which affects their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is further exacerbated in particular in the situation of homelessness, in informal settlements and in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed that water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or during natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability, and reaffirming also the importance of taking steps with a view to eliminating discrimination and inequalities based on factors such as rural-urban disparities, substandard housing, tenure status, income levels or other related considerations, Affirming the importance of national programmes and policies in ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Stressing the importance of achieving universal access to safe, affordable and adequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene by 2030 and of adequate and new sources of funding, including innovative financing, Stressing also the importance of monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, Affirming the importance of regional and international technical cooperation, where appropriate, as a means to promote the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, without prejudice to questions of international water law, including international watercourse law, Recognizing the important role that civil society plays at the local, national, regional and international levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have sustained access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 2. Welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and takes note with appreciation of his reports; 3. Reaffirms that States have the primary responsibility to ensure the full realization of all human rights and must take steps, nationally and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation by all appropriate means, including in particular the adoption of legislative measures in the implementation of their human rights obligations; 4. Stresses the important role of international cooperation and_ technical assistance by States, specialized agencies of the United Nations system and international and development partners, and by donor agencies, in particular in the timely achievement of the A/HRC/45/L.28 relevant Sustainable Development Goals; urges development partners to adopt a human rights-based approach that includes menstrual health management when designing, implementing and monitoring development programmes in support of national initiatives and plans of action relating to the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation;_and invites regional and international organizations to complement the efforts made by States to progressively realize the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in accordance with their respective mandates; 5. Underlines the importance of an effective remedy for violations of economic, social and cultural rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, and in this regard of judicial, quasi-judicial and other appropriate remedies, including procedures initiated by or on behalf of individuals or, as appropriate, groups of individuals, and of adequate procedures to avoid infringements of such rights with a view to ensuring justice for all for violations in the context of the realization of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation as components of the right to an adequate standard of living, including taking the measures necessary to ensure that women and girls and persons in vulnerable situations have equal access to effective remedies; 6. Notes with concern that, in spite of all efforts, gender inequalities still exist in the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in particular as a result of women’s and girls’ specific needs concerning menstrual hygiene and menstrual health; 7. Calls upon States: (a) To implement the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 6 on ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, in accordance with their obligations under international law; (b) To consider making the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, a priority at the highest level in order to ensure the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for all in a non-discriminatory manner while eliminating inequalities in access, including for persons in vulnerable situations and marginalized groups, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as well as on any other grounds, including disability; (c) To increase public funding and support private capital in order to make adequate funding available to the sector and to close the financing gap that hampers the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 and the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation;

(e) | To promote both women’s leadership and the full, effective, meaningful and equal participation of women in planning, decision-making and implementation on water and sanitation management; to ensure that a gender-based approach is adopted in relation to water and sanitation programmes and that measures are taken to reduce the time spent by women and girls in collecting household water, in order to address the negative impact of inadequate water and sanitation services on the access of girls to education; to protect women and girls from being physically threatened or assaulted, including from sexual violence, while collecting household water and when accessing sanitation facilities outside of their home or practising open defecation; to protect women’s and girls’ equal access to water and sanitation; and to take positive measures to guarantee the availability and accessibility of these rights; (f) To promote safe public spaces and improve the security and safety of all women and girls through gender-responsive rural and urban planning and infrastructure when accessing sanitation facilities and water waste collection and treatment facilities outside their homes or when collecting household water; A/HRC/45/L.28 (g) | To enhance international solidarity, cooperation and support for countries hosting large numbers of displaced persons and refugees to address their water- and sanitation-related challenges; (h) To address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by ensuring access to factual information thereon, addressing the negative social norms around the issue in order to foster a culture in which menstruation is recognized as healthy and natural and ensuring universal access to hygienic products and gender- sensitive facilities, including options for the disposal and waste management of menstrual hygiene products, while recognizing that women’s and girls’ attendance at school, university or, for women, work, can be affected by negative perceptions of menstruation and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene, such as safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in schools, public places and, for women, the workplace; (i) To take steps to promote action to raise international awareness on the issue of waterborne diseases and to mitigate the disproportionate impact of water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases on children and reduce child mortality, morbidity and stunting by ensuring the progressive realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation and by engaging in partnerships with stakeholders to implement projects aimed at scaling up access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in developing countries; Gj) To take measures to accelerate the realization of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, in line with the Sustainable Development Goal 6 global acceleration framework, in particular in the context of responding to and preventing the spread of COVID-19, including by working collaboratively with all stakeholders in a coordinated manner to improve water and sanitation services and by ensuring that water and sanitation systems are resilient and sustainable in order to protect people’s health and support national health systems; (k) | To step up disease prevention efforts by ensuring access to safe, adequate and affordable water and sanitation services for all in public and private spaces; (1) To apply broad and inclusive participatory approaches, consulting and coordinating with local communities and other stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on adequate solutions to ensure sustainable and non-discriminatory access to adequate water and sanitation services;

which is the most effective method of preventing the spread of COVID-19, Expressing concern that climate change has contributed and continues to contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of both sudden-onset natural disasters and slow-onset events, and that these events have adverse effects on the full enjoyment of all human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, Recognizing that, while the implications of climate change-related impacts and environmental damage for the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation affect individuals and communities around the world, the consequences are felt most acutely by those segments of the population that are already in vulnerable and marginalized situations, such as people living in informal settlements, people living in small island developing States and the least developed countries, rural and local communities and people facing desertification, land degradation, drought and water scarcity, as well as rising water levels due to storm surges, sea level rise and flooding, and recognizing also that indigenous peoples, because of their specific situation and nature, may be among the first to face the direct consequences of climate change owing to their dependence upon and close relationship with the environment and its resources, Deeply concerned that women and girls often face particular barriers in their enjoyment of the rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, which are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, and that they shoulder the main burden of collecting household water in many parts of the world, which constitutes a major impediment to the achievement of their economic empowerment, independence and social and economic development, Deeply concerned also that widespread silence and stigma surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene mean that women and girls often lack basic information thereon, are excluded and stigmatized and are thus prevented from realizing their full potential, Deeply concerned further that the lack of access to adequate water and sanitation services, including for menstrual hygiene management, especially in schools, workplaces, health centres and public facilities and buildings, negatively affects gender equality and women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to education, health, safe and healthy working conditions and to participate in public affairs, Deeply concerned that women and girls are particularly at risk of and exposed to attacks, sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and other threats to their safety while collecting household water, when accessing sanitation facilities outside their homes or when, A/HRC/45/L.28/Rev.1 in the absence of adequate sanitation facilities, practising open defecation and urination, which limits their ability to move freely and safely in the public sphere, Deeply concerned also that persons with disabilities, especially children with disabilities, often face barriers in accessing water and sanitation facilities, as such facilities are often inaccessible and inappropriate for meeting their needs, which affects their ability to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, including education and employment, which is further exacerbated in particular in the situation of homelessness, in informal settlements and in humanitarian emergencies and crises, Deeply alarmed that water-, sanitation- and hygiene-related diseases have a disproportionate impact on children and that, in humanitarian crises, including in times of conflict or during natural disasters, children suffer the most from interruptions in water and sanitation services, and underscoring that progress on reducing child mortality, morbidity and stunting is linked to children’s and women’s access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, Reaffirming the importance of eliminating discrimination and inequalities in the enjoyment of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social

levels in facilitating the achievement of the purposes and principles of the United Nations, fundamental freedoms and human rights, including the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, 1. Reaffirms that the human right to safe drinking water entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have sustained access to sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use, and that the human right to sanitation entitles everyone, without discrimination, to have physical and affordable access to sanitation, in all spheres of life, that is safe, hygienic, secure, socially and culturally acceptable and that provides privacy and ensures dignity, while reaffirming that both rights are components of the right to an adequate standard of living; 2.

the highest international standards of transparency and accountability, with all Syrians, including displaced persons and refugees, eligible to participate, as well as the establishment of a neutral

to engage in a constructive and active manner in order to advance the work of the committee in line with the agreed terms of reference and rules of procedure, Noting with deep concern the culture of impunity from within the Syrian regime for the most serious violations of international law and violations and abuses of human rights law committed during the present conflict, some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity, which has provided a fertile ground for further violations and abuses, Emphasizing the importance of accountability for the most serious crimes in violation of international law committed during the conflict for ensuring sustainable peace, Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in Dar’a in March 2011, and noting that the violent oppression of civilian protests by the Syrian regime, which later escalated to the direct shelling of civilians, fuelled the escalation of armed violence and the rise of violent extremist groups and terrorist groups, Recalling also all relevant resolutions on the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and the protection of United Nations personnel, including its resolution 73/137 of 14 December 2018, as well as Security Council resolutions on the protection of humanitarian personnel, including resolution 2175 (2014) of 29 August 2014, the relevant statements by the President of the Security Council referring to the specific obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and protect, in situations of armed conflict, all medical personnel and humanitarian workers exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport, equipment, hospitals and other medical facilities, and to ensure that the wounded and sick receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention required, and condemning attacks against hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are collected, including makeshift hospitals, as well as attacks against medical personnel and humanitarian workers that are in violation of international humanitarian law, Expressing grave concern at the indiscriminate use of force by the Syrian regime against civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and fomented the spread of violent extremism and violent extremist groups and which demonstrates the continuing failure of the Syrian regime to protect the population and implement the relevant resolutions and decisions of United Nations bodies and has created a safe haven and operating environment for war crimes and crimes against humanity, Expressing grave concern also at the remaining presence of violent extremism and violent extremist groups, terrorists and terrorist groups, and strongly condemning all violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law committed in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party to the conflict, in particular ISIL (also known as Da’esh), Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups, armed groups and non-state actors, and also the Syrian regime and its allies, 4/18 Noting with serious concern the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic that non-State armed groups still resort to the use of force against civilians, Reaffirming its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances, emphasizing that any use of chemical weapons anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstances is unacceptable and is and would be a violation of international law, and expressing its strong conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons must and should be held accountable, Condemning in the strongest possible terms the fact that chemical weapons have been used since 2012 in the Syrian Arab Republic, including as reported in April 2020 by the Investigation and Identification Team of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Air Force had carried out three chemical weapons attacks in Ltamenah during March 2017, welcoming the decision adopted on 9 July 2020 by the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, *! in which the Executive Council condemned the use by the Syrian Arab Republic of chemical weapons in Ltamenah and requested that the Syrian Arab Republic take steps to redress the situation within 90 days, regretting the failure of the Syrian Arab Republic to reply to this request, recalling the report of 26 October 2017 of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism,” which concluded that the Syrian Arab Air Force had been responsible for the use of the chemical weapon sarin on 4 April 2017 in Khan Shaykhun, and the report of 24 August 2016 of the Mechanism,** which concluded that the Syrian Arab Armed Forces had been responsible for the attacks that released toxic substances in Talmenes in 2014 and in Sarmin and Qmenas in 2015 and that ISIL (also known as Da’esh) had used sulfur mustard in Marea in 2015 and in Umm Hawsh in 2016, accordingly noting with great concern the reports of the fact-finding mission of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons regarding incidents in Saraqib, and involving alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon in Duma, which concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon had taken place, and demanding that the perpetrators immediately desist from any further use of chemical weapons, Expressing support for the work carried out by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic, welcoming its reports, strongly condemning the lack of cooperation by the Syrian regime with the Commission of Inquiry, reiterating its decision to transmit the reports of the Commission of Inquiry to the Security Council, expressing its appreciation to the Commission of Inquiry for its briefings to members of the Security Council, and requesting that the Commission of Inquiry continue to brief the General Assembly and members of the Security

Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011* and their consideration by the General Assembly, noting with serious concern the observation of the Commission of Inquiry that, since March 2011, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian regime has conducted widespread and systemic attacks against the civilian population 31 A/74/959-S/2020/724, enclosure. 32 §/2017/904. 5/18 amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, including targeted attacks on protected persons and objects, including medical facilities, and personnel and transport and blocked humanitarian convoys, as well as enforced disappearances, torture in detention, arbitrary detentions, summary executions and other violations and abuses, and underscoring the need for those allegations to be examined and evidence to be collected and made available for future accountability efforts, Strongly condemning the reported killing of detainees in Syrian military intelligence facilities and the widespread practice of enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and the use of sexual and gender-based violence and torture in detention centres referred to in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry, including, but not limited to, Branch 215, Branch 227, Branch 235, Branch 251, the Air Force Intelligence Investigation Branch at Mazzah military airport and Saydnaya prison, including the practice of mass hangings by the regime, as well as the killing of detainees at military hospitals, including Tishrin and Harasta hospitals, Recalling the statements made by the Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are likely to have been committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, noting the repeated encouragement by the High Commissioner for the Security Council to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court, and regretting that a resolution * was not adopted notwithstanding broad support from Member States, Recalling also the report of 6 April 2020 of the United Nations Board of Inquiry* into strikes that damaged and destroyed health-care facilities in the north- west of the Syrian Arab Republic, including sites whose coordinates had been recorded on the United Nations deconfliction list as a step to ensure that they would not be targeted or impacted by violence, and which in most instances examined, concluded that it was “highly probable that the strikes had been carried out by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and/or its allies” and found that health-care services were being provided at the time of some of the strikes and that there were no armed opposition groups in or near the facilities, and calling on all parties to adhere to and comply with the deconfliction mechanism, Calling for the immediate repeal of Law No. 10/2018, concerned about the Syrian regime’s infringement on the housing, land and property of Syrians, particularly through the dispossession of displaced Syrians’ land and property in the national legislation and similar measures, which would have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property and to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it, and expressing concern about reports of armed groups’ abuses of Syrians’ housing, land and property rights in areas under their control, Deploring in this regard the existence and application of national legislation, in particular Law No. 42/2018 and other legislation and practices concerning housing, land and property rights, which have a significant detrimental impact on the rights of Syrians displaced by the conflict to claim their property, as evidenced by continuing reports of widespread demolition of property in areas formerly controlled by the Syrian opposition as well as the confiscation of property owned by arbitrarily detained and missing persons throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, calling for the immediate repeal of that legislation, and stressing the right of everyone, including displaced Syrians, to not be arbitrarily deprived of their property and that they should be able 35 §/2014/348. 36 See S/2020/278, annex. 6/18 to return to their homes in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner when the situation on the ground allows it, Expressing concern that the implementation of Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014), 2165 (2014), 2191 (2014), 2254 (2015), 2258 (2015), 2268 (2016), 2286 (2016), 2393 (2017), 2401 (2018), 2449 (2018), 2504 (2020) and 2533(2020) remains unresolved, and noting the urgent need to strengthen efforts to address the humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, including through protection of civilians and safe, full, immediate, unimpeded and sustained humanitarian access throughout the Syrian Arab Republic, Emphasizing that the humanitarian cross-border mechanism remains an essential and life-saving channel to address the humanitarian needs of a significant portion of the population of the Syrian Arab Republic, which cannot be reached through existing operations within the Syrian Arab Republic, and emphasizing also that an immediate and significant improvement to cross-line access and respect for principled humanitarian action are essential to prevent further unnecessary suffering and loss of life, Expressing grave concern at the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and about United Nations reports on rising numbers of death notices and burials which seem to indicate that actual COVID-19 cases in the Syrian Arab Republic far exceed official figures, recognizing that the pandemic presents a profound challenge to the decimated health system, socioeconomic and humanitarian situations of the Syrian Arab Republic, underlining that the grave risk posed by COVID-19 heightens the imperative of using every possible means, including the cross-border mechanism, to reach people in need without preconditions and discrimination, calling for the provision of humanitarian assistance to all parts of the Syrian Arab Republic, including in areas where humanitarian needs are especially urgent, and stressing the importance of accurate and timely data collection and reporting, Recalling its commitment to Security Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014), and 2253 (2015) of 17 December 2015, Alarmed that more than 5.5 million refugees, including more than 3.8 million women and children, have been forced to flee the Syrian Arab Republic and that 11.1 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic, of whom 5.9 million are internally displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has resulted in an influx of Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, other countries in the region and beyond, and alarmed at the risk the situation presents to regional and international stability, Expressing its profound indignation at the death of more than 17,000 children and the many more injured since the beginning of the peaceful protests in March 2011, and at all violations and abuses committed against children in contravention of applicable international law, including those involving their recruitment and use, abduction, killing and maiming and rape and other forms of sexual violence, attacks on schools and hospitals, and denial of humanitarian access, as well as their arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and ill-treatment and their use as human shields, and noting in this regard the adoption on 18 July 2019 of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict conclusions on children and armed conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic*’ as well as the report of 13 January 2020 of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry entitled “They have erased the dreams of my children: children’s rights in the Syrian Arab Republic”, and emphasizing that the Syrian regime and its allies must comply with their applicable international law 7/18 obligations that are relevant to children, including under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Protocols thereto, Noting with concern that the Hawl camp currently hosts over 64,000 people, 92 per cent of whom are women and children, including some 35,000 children under 12 years of age who live under extremely challenging conditions, Recalling with serious concern the findings of the Commission of Inquiry in its report entitled “Out of sight, out of mind: deaths in detention in the Syrian Arab Republic”, noting in this regard the issuing of death notifications of detained individuals by the Syrian regime, which provides further indication of systematic violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as well as the Commission’s reporting in March 2019 on the scope and scale of arbitrary arrests and detention used by government forces as tools of repression that have led to the custodial deaths of tens of thousands of Syrian civilians and its reporting that the deaths of thousands of individuals previously detained in Hama, Ladhigiyah, Hasakah and Damascus have been confirmed by Syrian regime entities through certificates of death, and findings of the Commission in its report of March 2018 entitled “Detention in the Syrian Arab Republic: a way forward”, noting that the whereabouts of tens of thousands of detainees remains unknown and unacknowledged by the Syrian regime, recalling chilling accounts of torture, neglect and inhumane conditions, which the Commission meticulously documented and described as amounting to crimes against humanity, of extermination, murder, rape or other forms of sexual violence, torture and imprisonment in the context of the regime’s widespread and systematic detentions, and immediately calling for the cessation of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including sexual and gender-based violence, in places of detention, and the cessation of all forms of incommunicado detention, for the release of all persons arbitrarily detained, for all feasible measures to be taken, under Security Council resolution 2474 (2019) of 11 June 2019, to search for and reveal the fates of those detained and/or disappeared, and for the further establishment of an effective channel of communication with families to ensure that their legal, economic and psychological needs are addressed adequately, as set out in its latest report, *® Urging the Syrian regime to provide families with the remains of their relatives whose fate has been disclosed, including those who have been summarily executed, to take all appropriate measures immediately to protect the lives and rights of all persons currently detained or unaccounted for, and to clarify the fate of those who remain missing or are still in custody in accordance with Security Council resolution 2474 (2019), many of whom still remain in detention and are highly vulnerable to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) owing to overcrowded conditions and pre-existing health issues, such as widespread malnutrition and tuberculosis, despite calls from the Secretary-General, the Special Envoy and the international community for the large-scale release of detainees in the Syrian Arab Republic to mitigate the spread of the virus, Welcoming Security Council resolution 2475 (2019) of 20 June 2019 on the situation of persons with disabilities in armed conflict, expressing serious concern regarding the disproportionate impact that armed conflict has on persons with disabilities, including abandonment, violence and lack of access to basic services, stressing the protection and assistance needs of all affected civilian populations, and emphasizing the need to consider the particular needs of persons with disabilities in humanitarian response in the Syrian conflict, 8/18 Expressing its deep appreciation for the significant efforts that have been made by neighbouring countries and other countries in the region to accommodate Syrians, while acknowledging the increasing financial, socioeconomic and political impact of the presence of large-scale refugee and displaced populations in those countries, Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations and the League of Arab States and all diplomatic efforts to achieve a political solution to the Syrian crisis based on the final communiqué of the Action Group for Syria of 30 June 2012 and consistent with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), Expressing full support for the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary- General for Syria, with a view to the protection of the civilian population and the full implementation of the Syrian political process that establishes credible, inclusive and non-sectarian governance in accordance with the final communiqué and consistent with Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015) and 2258 (2015), urging Syrian parties to engage constructively with the Constitutional Committee in order to pave the way for the negotiation of a genuine political transition, noting with appreciation the mediation efforts to facilitate the establishment of a ceasefire in the Syrian Arab Republic, as noted by the Security Council in its resolution 2336 (2016), and supporting the efforts to end violence, while expressing deep concern at the violations, demanding that all parties to the ceasefire in the Syrian Arab Republic respect their commitments, and urging all Member States, especially the members of the International Syria Support Group, to use their influence to ensure respect for those commitments and the full implementation of those resolutions, to support efforts to create conditions for a durable and lasting ceasefire, which is essential to achieving a political solution to the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, and to bring to an end the systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, 1.
