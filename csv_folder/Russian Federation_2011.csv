Kingdom and Northern Ireland and United States of America",N/A,N/A,"The Security Council, Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation in Somalia, especially resolutions 1918 (2010) and 1976 (2011), Continuing to be gravely concerned by the growing threat that piracy and armed robbery at sea against vessels off the coast of Somalia pose to the situation in Somalia, States in the region and other States, as well as to international navigation, the safety of commercial maritime routes and the safety of seafarers and other persons, and also gravely concerned by the increased level of violence employed by pirates and persons involved in armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, Emphasizing the importance of finding a comprehensive solution to the problem of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, Stressing the need to build Somalia’s potential for sustainable economic growth as a means to tackle the underlying causes of piracy, including poverty, thus contributing to a durable eradication of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia and illegal activities connected therewith, Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, Reaffirming that international law, as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (Convention), in particular its articles 100, 101 and 105, sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities, Further reaffirming that the provisions of this resolution apply only with respect to the situation in Somalia and do not affect the rights and obligations or responsibilities of Member States under international law, Bearing in mind the Djibouti Code of Conduct concerning the Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, and recognizing the commitment of signatory States to review their national legislation with a view to ensuring that national laws to criminalize piracy and armed robbery against ships, and adequate guidelines for the exercise of

condemning the continuing practice of hostage-taking by suspected pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, expressing serious concern at the inhuman conditions hostage face in captivity,

piracy having to be released without facing justice, reaffirming that the failure to prosecute persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia undermines anti-piracy efforts of the international community and being determined to create conditions to ensure that pirates are held accountable, Noting with interest the conclusion in the Secretary-General’s report on the modalities for the establishment of specialized Somali anti-piracy courts (S/2011/360) that, assuming that sufficient international assistance is provided, piracy trials being conducted by courts in Somaliland and Puntland are expected to reach international standards in about three years, and expressing its hope consistent with the mentioned Secretary-General’s report that this timeline will be accelerated if suitable experts, including those from the Somali diaspora, can be identified and recruited, Welcoming the consultations between the United Nations and regional States,

Requests States and regional organizations to consider possible ways to seek and allow for the effective contribution of the Somali diaspora to anti-piracy efforts, in particular in the area of prosecution, as advised in the Secretary-General’s report (S/2011/360); 16. Decides to continue its consideration, as a matter of urgency, without prejudice to any further steps to ensure that pirates are held accountable, of the establishment of specialized anti-piracy courts in Somalia and other States in the region with substantial international participation and/or support, and requests that the Secretary-General, in conjunction with UNODC and UNDP, further consult with Somalia and regional States willing to establish such anti-piracy courts on the kind of international assistance, including the provision of international personnel, that would be required to help make such courts operational; the procedural arrangements required for transfer of apprehended pirates and related evidence; the projected case capacity of such courts; and the projected timeline and costs for such courts, and to provide to the Council in the light of such consultations within 90 days detailed implementation proposals for the establishment of such courts, as appropriate; 17. Underlines the importance for such courts to have jurisdiction to be exercised over not only suspects captured at sea, but also anyone who incites or intentionally facilitates piracy operations, including key figures of criminal networks involved in piracy who illicitly plan, organize, facilitate, or finance and profit from such attacks; 18. Recognizes that any increase in prosecution capacity must necessarily be accompanied by a related increase in prison capacity, and calls upon both Somali authorities, UNODC, UNDP and other international partners to support the construction and responsible operation of prisons in Somalia in accordance with international law; 19. Calls upon Member States, regional organizations and other appropriate partners to support efforts to establish specialized anti-piracy courts in the region by making or facilitating arrangements for the provision of international experts, including those from the Somali diaspora, through secondment or otherwise, and to otherwise support the work of UNODC, UNDP or others in this regard through contributions to the Trust Fund; 20.

Expresses its concern that women and girls are disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty, in part as a result of gender inequality and discrimination, that in many countries, girls are twice as likely as boys to die from malnutrition and preventable childhood diseases and that it is estimated that almost twice as many women as men suffer from malnutrition; 6.

Stresses the importance of fighting hunger in rural areas, including through national efforts supported by international partnerships to stop desertification and land degradation and through investments and public policies that are specifically appropriate to the risk of drylands, and in this regard calls for the full implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa; 1° 14.

Requests all States and private actors, as well as_ international organizations within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different fields; 18. Recognizes the need to strengthen national commitment as well as international assistance, upon the request of and in cooperation with the affected countries, towards the full realization and protection of the right to food, and in particular to develop national protection mechanisms for people forced to leave their homes and land because of hunger or humanitarian emergencies affecting the enjoyment of the right to food; 12 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Report of the Conference of FAO, Thirty-first Session, Rome, 2-13 November 2001 (C 2001/REP), appendix D.

Reaffirms that integrating food and nutritional support, with the goal that all people at all times will have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life, is part of a comprehensive effort to improve public health, including the response to the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other communicable diseases; 25. Urges States to give adequate priority in their development strategies and expenditures to the realization of the right to food; 26. Stresses the importance of international cooperation and development assistance as an effective contribution both to the expansion and improvement of agriculture and its environmental sustainability, food production, breeding projects on diversity of crops and livestock, and institutional innovations such as community seed banks, farmer field schools and seed fairs and to the provision of humanitarian food assistance in activities related to emergency situations, for the realization of the right to food and the achievement of sustainable food security, while recognizing that each country has the primary responsibility for ensuring the implementation of national programmes and strategies in this regard; 27.
