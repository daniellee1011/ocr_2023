Stressing again the urgent need for active and sustained effort to intensify

the comprehensive implementation of the recommendations and decisions unanimously

adopted at its tenth special session devoted to disarmament as contained in its

Final Document,

Convinced that, to this end, the effective, constructive and continuing

co-operation among all States on all levels, including the highest level based on

mutual confidence and political will, is essential,

A

Deeply concerned over the growing danger of a new round of the arms race which

would seriously aggravate international stability and increase the danger of

nuclear catastrophe,

Convinced that halting of the arms race and adoption of effective disarmament

measures, particularly in the field of nuclear disarmament, would release

considerable financial and material resources to be used for the economic and

social development of all States and, in particular, developing countries,

Taking into consideration the central role and primary responsibility of the

United Nations in combining the efforts and in supporting and developing active

co-operation among States aimed at the solution of disarmament problems,

Recalling in this context the Declaration on International Co-operation for

Disarmament of 11 December 1979, y

Noting that this Declaration may play a positive role in concerting efforts

for achievement of effective measures in the implementation of the goals set forth

in the Final Document of the tenth special session, to this end,

1. Calls upon all States to observe principles and make an active use of

ideas contained in the Declaration on International Co-operation for Disarmament,

so as to secure a constructive mutual dialogue aimed at limiting armaments,

particularly nuclear weapons, through the conclusion of respective agreements,

keeping in mind the ultimate objective of general and complete disarmament under

effective international control,

2. Calls upon the States to be guided in all disarmament negotiations by the

generally recognized principles of international law and to submit and

constructively consider, with full responsibility and in the spirit of

co-operation, proposals and initiatives aimed at promoting speedy progress in

disarmament negotiations and facilitating the achievement of mutually acceptable

concrete disarmament measures;

3. Calls upon the States to refrain from all actions which could hamper,

complicate or render impossible the disarmament negotiations which are under way,

the opening of new negotiations or the achievement of specific aisarmament

agreements and, in particular, not to hinder possible progress in negotiations on

disarmament by the discussion of unrelated issues;

5.

Calls upon the States to disseminate widely, in connexion with

Disarmament week, the principles of international co-operation designed to achieve

the goals of disarmament.

Recommends that the Preparatory Committee for the Second Special Session

of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament make an active use of the

Declaration on International Co-operation for Disarmament in the preparations for

the second special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to

disarmament,
